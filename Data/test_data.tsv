1	"I don't know what's in it." As if they know what's in the hamburgers they eat, the milk they drink, the high fructose corn syrup they consume... what a tragedy of stupidity.
1	"In the September time frame, unvaccinated people in their 40s were 55 times more likely to die from COVID-19 compared with fully vaccinated people of the same age." ~Texas Department of State Health Services, 11/15/21 --- This calculates to over 98% of COVID deaths occurring among unvaccinated Texans.
0	"It is a pity" that people are dying from the vaccine that would otherwise be healthy. These are not the same people that would have died from the virus, mind you. These people would have lived long healthy lives.
0	"The benefits outweigh the risks." is MARKETING, not science. Just like "If the glove doesn't fit, you must acquit."
0	"Vaccines are saving lives" meanwhile romania being the least vaccinated and also least infected country in the whole europe
0	"anti-vaccer" is a weaponized term so these pharmaceutical companies can get their way. You have to come up with a counter term like "drug pusher"
0	"if you don't have the vaccine, you're robbing someone else their right to live a healthy normal life" lmfao My I.Q just dropped 10 points listening to that Bullshit !
0	"we have checks and balances in place" like no legal liability for side effects in the vaccine
0	1 death from a vaccine is too many.
0	1 more good reason to homeschool! My body! My choice!
0	100 percent the reason im not getting it is because i dont trust the government
1	100% against hospitalization and death. They should of said this from go.
0	11 months on and still no symptoms. I feel great. No vaccine and have been visiting my 91 year old nan who smokes ALOT and she's fine. This is about depopulation a Eugenics program.
1	13k idiots. Natural selection. Let the people who wanna be safe. Don’t take it. More for the smarter people.
0	2 years in still unvaccinated and proud
0	3 versions of poison
1	6 cases out of over 6 million doses administered. Is that even statistically significant?
1	90% is hugely effective! They're not done with Phase 3 trials, but this is very promising. I'm overjoyed. Thank you, scientists!
0	90% with no idea of immunity or transmission? I'll take the 99 % survival rate w/natural immunity without inserting man-made materials into my body at cell Level.
0	99.6% of ACTIVE cases have mild or no symptoms. WHY would you get a vaccine for THAT?!?!
0	99.8% survival rate without a vaccine.
0	A famous comedian in Malaysia died of heart attack few days after booster, a soccer player, a cleaner, a random man, died suddenly after the booster. Many others are getting chest pain, high fever, rashes and many other not so mild side effects. Safety??
0	A friend of mine had a stroke, just 2 weeks after his second covid vaccine ...! Coincidence? I doubt it!
1	A good friend is recovering after covid, having refused vaccination. He is confused and has trouble focusing. He remembers that he wasn't that way before. A solid hit with covid leaves patients with an average of a seven IQ point drop. He isn't an average victim. He's young and healthy and he's going to live with this damage for decades.
1	A lot of you are alive because your parents made sure that you were vaccinated against the diseases that were killing children in the 40&50s. So what if you had a sore arm you are on the right side of the grass to complain about it. I am 81, have had my second shot no problems.
0	A man in my apartment building just died about a week ago of a brain bleed. He got the Covid shot. This shot is a killer.
0	A month after the vaccine I miscarried. Not so sure anymore and other woman complaining about heavier periods even lasting WEEKS…
1	A vaccine created in a year is an amazing achievement for science and humanity . I feel proud to live in these times.
0	A vaccine takes a number of years to be developed, this alone is reason enough to be antivaxx
0	A weapon of mass destruction portrayed as a cure for another weapon of mass destruction.
1	AND we were all blessed to be able to have access to those vaccines which prolonged lives or enhanced them!
0	AVOID these VERY DANGEROUS Covid-19 VACCINES!!!!
0	About 4 months ago, I had COVID-19. I just got my first vaccine and I became very ill with fever, chills, body aches and dizzy spells. Now I’m afraid to get the second dose. Any suggestions?
0	Absolutely no way will I have this vaccine
1	Absolutely. For me, being a college student, the benefits far outweigh the risk. I love your videos, and thank you for keeping us all informed about this new type of vaccine.
0	After almost dying from a cortisone injection which a doctor said was safe I can say that I would fight to the death before letting anyone inject my future children with any big pharma drug.
0	After they injected the vaccine they say, "we need to better understand what that risk is "... Nice approach.Shouldn't it be in the opposite order?
1	All COVID-19 vaccines that are in development are being carefully evaluated in clinical trials and will be authorized or approved only if they make it substantially less likely you’ll get COVID-19
1	All I can say is wow!!
1	All countries, rich and poor, are deeply affected by the virus, and that the vaccination or vaccine distribution should be for all, not for the few.
1	All who doesn’t take the vaccine want Corona to keep harvesting lives and wreak Havoc upon the world
0	All you have to do is beat them at their own game! Just say “I identify as fully vaccinated.” They can’t demand proof or it’s discrimination!!!!
0	All you have to do is build your immune system zinc vitamin D three vitamin C find a good holistic doctor and talk to them you don't need the vaccine
0	Alright, so now look into the covid protein spike and it's prion capable modification. Make sure you understand what you are getting yourself into when you take those shots, and it will also shed some light on the side effects you may have seen.
1	Amazing news! I just hope that people will think about the bigger picture here. Yes covid has a 99% survival rate but I encourage everyone to have this vaccine to protect the vulnerable in society not just themselves!
1	Amazing video! I'm glad I caught up to this before taking my first shot of Pfizer's. Most of my family are vaccinated with the two doses and barely had side effects. While I may seem as anti-vaccine, I just say that because I don't feel the need to vaccinate myself, but I also don't deny the statistics of a vaccine when it works; lowering death toll and infection rate.
1	An infected teacher standing up projecting their voice (virus) can infect a whole class of students in a lesson and in turn their families. That is why it is vital to vaccinate all teachers before ending remote learning.
1	And a vaccine literally introduces the virus to your immune system in a non harmful way... Good food doesn't produce antibodies, a vaccine does.
0	And the companies that produce these vaccines are immune from prosecution should it all go wrong. Funny that, they're obviously concerned about how this vaccine is going to affect some people.
0	And when one dies after the vaccine, it means the patient is not funcioning.
1	And you’re more likely to be hit by lightning than get a blood clot from a vaccine (odds are less than one in a million)
0	Another vaccine propaganda article!
1	Anti Vaxxer logic: My kid can’t get autism, if they die from polio
1	Anti vaxxers will ignore all of the facts. This is proof that the covid vaccines are safe. They've all had human trials.
1	Anti-vaxers chose to believe the lie because the lie is always more interesting than the truth
1	Antibodies were detected after the vaccine
1	Antivaxxers seem to have left the contents of their heads at home.
1	Antivaxxers: "Give me liberty or give me death!" Covid: "No problem, heres both."
0	Any side effects doctor. None at all just death. But if you get covid you may die. Just vaccinate me to make sure I die than.
1	Any vaccine is a better chance of NOT having clots than not getting it at all. Bring back the J&J. I’d rather suffer once and take the risk
0	Anybody ever hear of a “vaccine” you need to take four times in a year and it doesn’t stop the spread of the disease? Me neither.
0	Anyone who gets offended and defensive when asked about their product, it's because they have a hidden agenda.
0	Aren’t these vaccines still very experimental?
1	As a biochemist in training I can't stress enough how incredible this mechanism is: logical, simple yet incredibly effective and beautiful.
0	As a biotech and ex-moderna investor, there has never been a mRNA vaccine approved for human testing before.
1	As a clinical analyst and graduate in Public Health, this man did an excellent job in detailing the efficacy and workings of these vaccines. Everyone should watch and consider getting vaccinated! We deserve our livelihood back.
0	As a healthcare worker, I am NOT taking the vaccine at all. As an Army veteran, I do not trust it.
1	As a participant, who definitely got the vaccine, that's awesome news. Please get vaccinated with this or another approved vaccine when possible people, and trust science for goodness sakes.
1	As a wise man once said, "Taking COVID-19 vaccination is like wearing a seatbelt in a car. There are possibilities that can give you some amount of dangers if you wear a seatbelt, but there are also a MUCH more amount of dangers or possibly death if you don't wear a seatbelt. Either way, no one is correct since they technically have their separate amount of dangers, but wearing a seatbelt is usually much safer than not wearing a seatbelt." And I really do agree with him. That's all :)
0	As an older healthy fit person that works out hard, takes care of their health and hasn't been sick in 7 years I don't need it! MY BODY MY CHOICE!
1	As bad as this pamdemic was I honestly think it may have advanced medicine by 10 years then where it otherwise would have been
1	As someone who was born autistic I get really offended by the fact Karen’s would rather have their children die then have autism.
1	As soon as it's my turn, yes. I think it's irresponsible to not get it.
1	AstraZeneca 2 weeks ago, I feel healthy, hoping after my next jab I feel the same.
1	Awesome news! The vaccines are going to end this pandemic soon.
1	Ay finally I can prove to my mom why vaccines are important
1	Back in my day, we didn't have vaccines. We just died.
1	Be aware of the important role of vaccination, it can save your life
1	Being born to an anti vaccine mom is like being spawn killed
1	Being concerned of the risks of the vaccine is acceptable but dismissing all evidence of past vaccines being effective is pure ignorance and stupidity.
1	Believe in vaccines
1	Best explanation I have seen so far on vaccines. My goodness. This should be shown everywhere.
1	Best thing you can do for yourself is get the one that’s available to you at the earliest and don’t wait. that’s gonna do worlds better than trying to compare them or waiting.
1	Best vaccine is the one that’s available to you first
0	Better develop medication to give to people who need it in case of Covid instead of poisoning healthy folks.
0	Big NO TO VACCINES ! We need Healthy lifestyle only .
1	Biontech and curevac basicly startet the mrna thing and, after they cured covid, they could also find a cure for cancer with this technology. Very promising.
0	Blood clots, uncontrollable shakes and death but keep wearing a mask ... oh and the vaccines are absolutely safe .... bs!
1	Boohoo, I got the covid vaccine and am fine
1	Boom! What a fantastic achievement by researchers, scientists, AI and ML professionals and field professionals! Just a colossal achievement!
1	Booster shots are extremely effective at protecting against serious illness and hospitalization from COVID. Vaccines work!
1	Both natural immunity and immunity produced by a vaccine are important parts of COVID-19 disease that experts are trying to learn more about, and CDC will keep the public informed as new evidence becomes available.
1	Both of my grandparents got theirs and no reported issues. My grandma got hers about a month ago now and only said there was a little pain in her arm but they is 100% normal. The rest of my family is getting it Monday :)
1	Bring it on so we can live again
0	Bro. The vaccine side effects are the virus symptoms? Whats goin on there?
0	But my opinion. ...vaccine against covid19 is not safe
0	But they have not seen the data of the side effects but they are advertising the vaccine already. Something is not right
1	COVID-19 vaccination is a safer way to help build protection
1	COVID-19 vaccination will be an important tool to help stop the pandemic
1	COVID-19 vaccination will help keep you from getting COVID-19
0	Call it a treatment. It’s not a vaccine. It doesn’t even fit the CDC definition for a vaccine.
0	Call tonight from best friend who's relative (age 54) was found dead on the porch this morning after walking the dogs. He had his first Covid vaccine shot yesterday. He had long term MS but received a healthy report from the Dr. last week. Everyone in shock.
1	Can help to improve immunity
0	Can someone explain to me why risking getting the vaccine would be better than just getting covid, or maybe even getting neither considering the covid risks are minimal anyway? I'm also under 30 and decently healthy.
0	Can we stop calling them "breakthrough cases" when they already said the shot doesn't keep you from getting it
1	Can't wait for my parents to get vaccinated.
0	Can't wait to see how this vax reacts with the next round of engineered covid.
0	Canadian here. Always say no to 1984. The idea that the unvaccinated are a risk to anyone other than themselves is moronic.
1	Can’t wait until my son can get it.
1	China vaccines good
1	Co-worker was hung up on vaccine side-effects even though her doctors and some co-workers (me included) said it was nothing and Covid itself is worse. ICU for her.
0	Come on, my sister got the vaccine and still tested positive. From the day I was born I've never depended on the vaccines to be alive
0	Considering they weren't even rushing in that case as they are now I see no reason to trust whatever vaccine they come out with and I'll definitely not take their vaccine until at least 2/3 years pass without incident
1	Cooking at home or taking a bath is more dangerous than having the vaccine. Less than 1 in a million side effects!
1	Covid is serious and death is not its only serious outcome! No one should get Covid deliberately!! Our safest way out of this are the vaccines so go get vaccinated people!!
0	Covid-19 vaccines will protect us 1 week. My wife received her 2nd dose last week, and she was just diagnosed with Covid-19 today.
1	Crazy how some people believe the links their friends post on Facebook more than doctors who have studied medicine for years.
0	Crimes Against Humanity
0	DO NOT TAKE THAT VACCINE!!!!
1	Day 11 on Moderna and I feel fine. Just had sore arm the day after I got it.
1	Day 12 on moderna no side affects so far I feel good
1	Day two with Covid, I feel like I've been hit by a double decker bus. If this is what it's like after three jabs I can only imagine what it would be like for the unvaccinated! Get your vaccines people!
0	Deadly cocktail of chemicals
0	Definitely not taking this poison
0	Didnt even need the first shot. It has been proven to be ineffective
0	Do not get the vaccine
0	Do not give your kids this injection!!
0	Do not take the vaccine! It is the mark of the beast! Whoever takes it, God will leave DESOLATE and not forgive!
0	Do not take the vaccine, do I repeat myself ,DO NOT TAKE THE VACCINE!!!!
0	Do not take the vaccine. If they make you take it, fight for your life and go to WAR
0	Doctors said it didn't impact periods. They lied.
0	Don't bring vaccine in our Africa we don't want it
0	Don't care what this guy and the media says about the vaccine! Read my lips, I am not taking the cr!p
0	Don't do it people. Your immune system works just fine on its own.
0	Don't get the Vaccine
0	Don't get the vaccine
0	Don't let the government infect you're cells with RNA. You're natural immune system is all you or anyone needs! Believe in nature and yourself!
0	Don't take any vaccine because its all toxic.
0	Don't take the vaccine. I took it and it was a big mistake. the day after i got the vaccine i started to black out, get dizzy, I also got fever, nausea, and i got bad diarrhea. My school had to quarantine me for 12 days and the same thing happened to 2 of my friends.
0	Don't take this vaccine guys!!
0	Don't take vaccines. Just pray
0	Don't trust the vaccine . My choice .
0	Don’t become their GUINEA PIG to see if you live or die!
0	Dude if they make a "vaccine" less than a year then you know somethings up.
0	During a vaccination session: Patient: Does it guarantee immunity ? Doctor: Only for the manufacturers.
0	EVERYONE should be refusing to be a guinea pig in this eugenics experiment
0	Eat healthy take care of your immune systems then you won’t need vaccines love your body and yourself.
0	Every drug has side effects
1	Everybody, finishing something quickly doesn't mean it is rushed
0	Everyone keep injection there poison in your body you have that right but do not take away my right to choose
1	Everyone should do all they can to keep the anti vaccers from getting the shot!! Its a gift to clean the idiots from society
1	Everyone should take the vaccine Even the anti-vaccine people
1	Exact same side effects as every other vaccine, people are just always scared of the unknown.
0	Experimental! GOOD LUCK! but we are goooood! no Vaxx here thank you!, I'll pick getting infected let's gooooo
1	FUCK YEAH!!! My family and I were able to get our first doses yesterday! Happy to be part of this statistic!!!
0	First let me say forget about the"vaccine". Not taking it. I went thru the whole year as a essential worker. Sometimes didn't wear a mask. No virus. The government is doing something shady I just don't know what it is but miss me with this BS vaccine
1	Flu vaccines regularly have 40-60% efficacy, considered to be good. Anything that is 60% - 90% efficacy is 'simply the best'
0	Folks, it’s really simple. Don’t let anyone with zero liability stick an experimental substance that has a terrible track record with animals into your body. This is DUH 101.
0	For a disease that has a 0.01% chance of killing me in the first place, why would I take a vaccine that has a highe chance of killing me than the disease itself? I'm no anti-vaxxer, but im definitely not getting ANY of these covid vaccines.
1	For anyone wondering, the vaccines are perfectly safe. I got mine today and didn’t immediately die. My mom also got her’s a week before mine and she’s fine
0	For this vaccine human are the rats,
1	For those on the fence, it’s time to protect yourself and others; please get vaccinated.
1	Fortunately, a vaccine for Covid-19 has also been produced. That means all activities will be returned to its orbit and happy life lies ahead.
0	Four days after having my first vaccination, I was rushed to hospital with an aneurism bleed.... Maybe Just a coincidence, but I wouldn’t be having a second jab
0	Fuck the Vaccine
0	Fully test them first and let all of the pharmaceutical companies do what's in the best interest of the public. Not about the profit.
1	Fully vaccinated and feel great
1	Fully vaccinated!!! Suck it COVID!!!
1	Fully vaxxed as of last week since i quit my old job and joined a hospital in late Feb. GF just got her first shot too through our vaccine-share program that is constantly filled up. For the first time in a longtime I've started to feel hopeful.
1	Fully vaxxed as of today! Such a relief.
0	Fun fact: Im unvaccinated and healthy.
0	Funny how they say they still don’t know everything about the virus yet they claim to know everything about the safety of the vaccines.
1	Funny that all those people that are scared of the vaccine, drive their car, cooking, take medicine every day.. Each of these have higher odds of dying than the 1 in 10 million of the vaccine (Astra only)
0	Garbage vaccines with ZERO longterm data.
1	Get the vaccine
1	Get the vaccine if you can!
1	Get vaccinated it might save your life
1	Get vaccinated!
1	Get vaccinated! The life you save might be your own.
1	Get your vaccines, it's better than being dead.

1	Glad they can be vaccinated. Wish availability of vaccine vastly improves so all who want a vaccine can get one.
1	Glad to see senior citizens are getting the shots first
1	God bless those diligent scientists who worked hard to produce these magnificent vaccines. Everybody should be vaccinated after they've been given positive, truthful, and inspiring information about vaccines and vaccinations.
0	Good for you. I don't want the vaccine. So leave me alone.
0	Good luck to all of you who took any of these-vaccines- however I refuse to take any vaccine for this 95 percent exaggerated illness as mainly I feel it is anti-Biblical.
1	Good news because the pace of vaccination needs to pick up soon. Two million a day in the U.S. should be the floor.
1	Good news!
1	Good. I'm glad a vaccine has been determined to be safe and effective enough to be made available for anyone in the public who chooses to take it. If this helps some people reach a decision to opt to receive the vaccine and thereby ends up saving a few lives, then it is a good thing.
1	Goodness I'm so happy you made this video!! The amount of anti-maskers and anti-vaxers is increasing and its so disappointing! Spreading right info and educating the general public is more important than ever! So thank you for this!
1	Got Moderna on Monday. I feel the best I ever had!
1	Got both of the vaccine doses, first time had a small fever, second time only a sore arm and felt lightheaded. Other than that I'm perfectly fine and suggest everyone to do it.
1	Got fully vaccinated today, so I performed my "Civic Duty" as the "New World Order Government" claims it to be.

1	Got my Pfizer vaccine 1st dose today, about 8 hours ago. Feels about the same as a flu shot. Shoulder a bit sore, a bit fatigued. I think after a good nights sleep tonight I'll be fine.
1	Got my first Pfizer first dose and feeling good. Can’t wait for the second dose.
1	Got my first dose of Pfizer today. I was not ready for the atmosphere. Everyone was just so UP and excited and happy. It was the most fun I’ve had with strangers in over a year.
1	Got my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine this morning! So incredibly happy about it! Experiencing nothing but a sore arm.
1	Got my first dose today (Moderna) my right arm is very sore but nothing I can't handle. Im looking forward to the second dose lets end this nightmare!
1	Got my first moderna vaccine today. Health department texted at 1pm went right over to the site and was done by 2 pm. No way was I not going to get this shot.
1	Got my first vaccine (Pfizer) ! 3 weeks to wait for the second one. Finally - no more worries...

1	Got my second shot of moderna two days ago! Feel perfectly fine!
1	Got my second shot of moderna two days ago! Feel perfectly fine! In fact I feel better than after the first shot where I just had some deltoid tenderness. Now I feel normal!
1	Got my second vaccine today and guys the side effects everyone is scared of are basically nothing. Got a mild headache and felt tired. You can't tell the difference between this and just a poor night of rest honestly.
1	Got my shot thanks to Wisconsin's Save the Fatties program.
1	Got the Pfizer a month ago. Second dose makes you feel weak, but it's all worth it. I'm vaccinated
1	Got vaccinated today, feeling good :)
1	Got vaccinated with sinovac from China last week. So far no side effects. I even went to the gym 3 hours after i got vaccinated
1	Great job! Thanks for this video, very useful and help people to understand the vaccine clearly! Go and get vaccinated !
1	Great news. Fantastic work by those involved in creating this vaccine, so thankful to them.
1	Great video! Most of my family have had it and they're okay! A friend of mine told me the MMR is the reason I'm autistic.... I told him to do one
1	Great! Normalcy can't come soon enough, but we are almost there.
1	Had Covid-19. Got two vaccines and booster. I’m very grateful to research scientists, doctors and the dedicated medical world.
1	Had my first AZ shot 5 days ago and so far it has been a non event....not even a sore arm....
1	Had my first dose of Astra today, the pain on the jab area was way worse than my flu vaccine shot last year, it works!
1	Had my second dose a week ago. I'm so relieved to have gotten it, as I see the death toll and permanent injuries rising due to this disease. Wear your mask, wash your hands, social distance, and get vaccinated! That is how we will defeat COVID.
1	Had the vaccine yesterday feel great nothing but a sore and swollen arm
0	Hahahaa so much fun!!!!! We injecting chemicles!!!
1	Have already been vaccinated “ and I hope covid-19 stay away forever
0	He isn't concerned. Tell that to the family of those who died from the shot. My daughters customer said her mother ended up in ICU after the 2nd shot.
0	Hell no I will not take it
1	Here in Thailand, we barely have any vaccines, people are desperate to get vaccinated, and less that 10% of us are vaccinated. It feels very unfair that Americans just shoo it away when so many of us would have it in a heartbeat.
1	Hey cinco de mayo for my second shot too! High five! But I'm not going out to celebrate right away, I'm planning to take a week off for memorial day week and travel somewhere!
0	Higher risk for young children and the elderly
1	Honestly not taking the vaccine is irresponsible because it puts others in danger. People who refuse the vaccine because it is “too new” and “dangerous” are 1) wrong because the newest vaccines are similar to old vaccines proven to work, just specific to covid strains, and 2) selfish for putting their own standards above the livelihood and health of others.
1	Hope he got the vaccine. Either way thank you to him for furthering science!
0	How about we start with bels palsy or violent seizures. Or my favorite death. Take this vaccine at your own risk!!!
0	How can an employer force their employees to take a vaccine that’s not even an FDA approved?
0	How can they possibly know the long term side effects of a vaccine that has existed less than 6 months
0	How do we know the shot is working? Survival rate goes from 99.6% to 99.8%?
1	How do we say thank you to the health workers and scientists for their sacrifice and service? Receive the vaccine as soon as one can to lessen their load and keep wearing a mask to protect fellow citizens. In my 80th year, I am grateful and hopeful for better days ahead.
0	How many booster does it take to let you know the vaccine don't work
0	How naive the world is, this isn’t a vaccine
1	Huge news to get vaccine to the masses. We’re going to have a great summer America! Hope you’ve been working on that beach bod during quarantine
1	Hype ! Gonna take my Vaccine immediately . So cool . !
1	I JUST WANT TO END THIS, THE VACCINE IS THE THING THAT I WANT FROM THE START

0	I WILL NEVER GET THIS VACCINE ! It needs more time to develope
0	I WON'T BE TAKING ANYMORE SHOTS. SORRY
1	I Will Get The Vaccine
0	I aint taking ur zombie vaccine
1	I also got the vaccine, Moderna, and 5 days after I felt some inflammation in my axillary lymph nodes. Which suggests that I am forming an immunity, but just something that I wanted to share since it was pretty noticeable. I also had soreness of the injection site but other than that nothing else.
1	I also work in healthcare, I am proud to be a Caregiver and yes if I can get the vaccine I will. The well being of my Family and my clients are number one.
1	I am 80 and my wife is 77 and we took the Moderna vaccine and had no side effects on either shot.
0	I am NOT getting it at any cost .
1	I am a UCLA retiree and I still can’t even get my first vaccine because I cannot find any appointments
1	I am a doctor in the U.K. I had the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine. The benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks! All vaccines will have some degree of risk. The most important thing about vaccination is that it will significantly reduce the chances of you dying or ending up on a ventilator regardless of which vaccine you have!
0	I am against a vaccine for Covid! It has a massive survival rate 99.777%! Eat clean and exercise I’m not taking a vaccine for Covid
1	I am extremely happy that I have had 3 shots for COVID-19, a flu shot & a shingles shot. I feel wonderful, no flu, no headaches, no nothing. I agree, Go Get Vaccinated Now.
1	I am fully vaccinated and was fine second dose just soreness
1	I am fully vaccinated now! Yay! Go me!
1	I am happy that I live in Denmark, where people are very willing to be vaccinated. At this moment more than 71% of population got full vaccination and we have no restrictions anymore, our normal life is back on track!
0	I am not doing the vaccine, thank you.
0	I am not getting it because I don't want to die
0	I am not getting the vaccine. Half the people I talked to had side effects. I am not trading one risk for another. It’s my body.
0	I am not going to get the vaccine
1	I am planning to take one of these vaccines I believe they are going to make a difference I have no intention of wanting to be locked in doors to stay safe. Bring it on
1	I am so appreciative of this video, thank you very much for this much needed information, it is balanced and accurate and fair information, we need more Dr's to speak about the real effectiveness and information regarding the vaccine....there is way too much fear mongering and misleading info on other sites
1	I am so lucky to have been vaccinated and not have to worry so much. There are still so many things to do in life.
0	I am surprised they give you a choice in the military! However, I ain't taking that thing!
1	I am vaccinated today and my arm sore 24 hour I am very excited to see the end of Corona
0	I believe covid-19 was created in a lab by the Chinese government. The vaccine will just make covid-19 mutate exponentially faster to than it already is. Virus always is faster and smarter than any human can possibly imagine.
1	I believe vaccine very much and I'm in UAE here it's compulsory including each 13 day pcr test otherwise we cannot go anywhere except own Room and i love this rule thankful to UAE government
0	I can relate to the hesitancy. After I received my covid vaccine I spent the next few days hallucinating. That is not an experience I plan on repeating.
1	I can't wait for my second shot in 4 weeks!
1	I can't wait to get mine. Unfortunately my special Premier and his cabinet members who were all traveling abroad for Xmas (on Dec 13th they put a traveling ban both for cross provinces and international borders) are deemed more important than me and the majority of the population, so I have to wait.
1	I can't wait to get the vaccine! I am at risk and haven't left my home in a year. After I get it I'm going to double-mask and get a hair cut :)
1	I cannot understand why so many people don't wan to get the vaccine, I can understand it in some circumstances, but I believe that that is the underground scenario
1	I cant wait to receive my vaccine.
1	I can’t wait to get mine!
1	I did not have a "medical professional" advise me to get or not get the vaccination....I read the chart, and since I am over 65, and have some of the health issues, I signed up. No one said anything to me at either of the injection sites about whether I should get the shot or not. People have to use their own judgement and common sense about what to do...."medical professionals" all have different opinions.!!
0	I don't care about your facts or myths. Its all BS to me. I will never take this ridiculous vaccine! They will never tell you what's really in it! THINK TWICE!!
0	I don't care how many black nurses, celebrities, or tv doctors get the vaccine I'm not taking it.
0	I don't need to be told how to evaluate covid vaccine reactions. If someone was fine, gets the vaccine and dies with days or weeks; the vaccine caused it.
0	I don't plan to get this vaccine rushed out too fast!
0	I don't think I need to be vaccinated for a virus that has a 99% survivability rate. So, no, I won't be getting the vaccine.
0	I don't trust a vaccine made THAT fast. COVID-19 is a shitty, scary thing, but I'd rather stay in quarantine than possibly put myself at harm by taking a vaccine that isn't proven to be reliable
0	I don't trust doctors,the medical profession and the vaccine has not been tested long enough.
0	I don't trust it still I won't be getting it
1	I don't understand why 20 percent of careworkers wont have the vaccine .How can they say they care for their clients if they potentially will bring the infection back .Some are visiting 6 or 7 homes a day .If they dont care enough to have the vaccine they should find another job
0	I don't vaccinate my kids. I believe its harmful to them and could lead to complications.
0	I dont trust that vaccination at all
1	I don’t feel controlled by government when I wear a mask or get #COVID19Vaccine any more than I do wearing a seatbelt, deciding not to drink & drive or stopping at red light. I am vaccinated bc I want to be part of the solution, not part of the problem. The common good matters.
0	I don’t fully trust the vaccine yet until a couple months pass
0	I don’t have to do anything I’m not comfortable doing.
0	I don’t need a vaccine, the vitamin gummy bear I ate 4 years ago got my back
0	I don’t trust it!
0	I don’t trust taking this vaccine moving on.
1	I don’t trust trump, but I do trust the vaccine. I’m getting it ASAP.
1	I don’t understand why six people in six million (J&J,) is this much of a concern. Seems like the virus is much more dangerous.
1	I don’t understand why there are people on here telling others NOT to get vaccinated! You are part of the problem.
0	I feel bad for those who signed up for the experiment and thought they were given the vaccine when actually they're given a placebo
1	I feel better after the injection
1	I feel for all the doctors and nurses at the moment!! If only more people got vaccinated!! It would be less work for them all!!
1	I feel like I lost brain cells watching these anti vaxxers
1	I feel like listening to any anti-vaxxer is BEYOND frustrating when you are from a third world country, rejecting vaccines comes from their privilege of living in a developed country that we most certainly don't have
0	I feel sorry for people who get the vaccine, because they have no idea what it does to them :( the vaccine is not for covid19, the agenda is way different.
1	I felt super crummy right after the 2nd dose and then they where gone and as an ICU nurse that has seen the horrors of the pandemic first hand I’ll take it one million times over
0	I find it very unsettling that the majority of the covid videos had a like to dislike ratio of 1 to 10 or so. Now, it's about the opposite. Don't trust the illusion, guys. The vaccine kills.
1	I get J&J and none symptoms at all👍
1	I get me second tomorrow. I can’t explain the feeling of freedom (2 weeks later, I know, but nice to have it over with).
1	I getting my second Moderna vaccine shot tomorrow
1	I got both doses last year. For the first shot, my arm was just sore for a day. The second dose was a little bit unpleasant. Had a slight fever and runny nose for a day, but after that I was alright again. Till now I haven’t gotten sick, so that’s good!
1	I got both shots of the vaccine. Only had a sore arm for 24 hours. Feel fine.
0	I got covid from my sister who is vaccinated and she had it worse than me. I was barely sick and I'm not vaccinated. I've had colds that were worse.
1	I got mine Fri.Jan29. I get my 2nd one Feb. 29.
1	I got mine I'm doing fine
1	I got mine. I’m a kindergarten teacher. No side effects, no creepy stuff in it. If you are given the opportunity, take it. Try to be as brave and selfless as we are on the front lines in kindergarten.
1	I got my 2nd shot yesterday. No side effects unless you count that I get 5G on a 4G phone now and I have a hankering for human flesh.
1	I got my Moderna vaccine and now I'm a Wifi Hotspot
1	I got my Pfizer shot yesterday the only problem was my arm is a little stiff but other than that it’s all good.
1	I got my second dose earlier this month. I feel a-okay. 👍🏻
1	I got my second injection and once again my only side effect was a sore arm for a couple of days. I used an ice pack on it and that helped.
1	I got my vaccine today, got the Johnson and Johnson, it was the least painfully vaccine I have ever got, and I am very excited for my city is open 100%
1	I got the AstraZeneca vaccine today and glad that I did
1	I got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine 2 months ago and so far I have been filling fine with no problems.
1	I got the Pfizer vaccine and I am very pleased that I did.
1	I got the Pfizer vaccine months ago, literally no side-effects, I ain't gonna support anybody being forced to get it (by the government anyways, if shops wanna do vaccine passports and businesses wanna force their employees to get it, that's their business) but that won't stop me from thinking people who don't are idiots, barring legitimate medical reasons, like immune suppression or allergies to ingredients
1	I got the Pfizer vaccine. Last one is on April 1. So happy! No side effects!
1	I got the fever and everything. Yet, I would go and take another shot of the vaccine any day. I am eternally grateful to the scientists that spent years and even decades to research all of this. Thank you!
1	I got the first dose of the Pfizer vaccination today. I managed to get it despite being 29 and otherwise in perfect health because I volunteer at my local hospital. Glad to be in the 10% with the vaccine so far.
1	I got the first shot yesterday and feel fine
1	I got the moderna and it was easier than a flu shot. Still glad I watched this video because learning about the en vitro fetal cells being used to develop the J&J vax was really cool. Would definitely like to learn more about how they do that.
1	I got the vaccine both doses of Moderna and I’m thriving. Stop putting false fears.
1	I got the vaccine today, I figured getting the vaccine and dealing with a few uncomfortable side effects would be better than getting covid and ending up in hospital.
1	I got vaccinated and I'm glad! Time to get back to life now!
1	I got vaccinated because I am not a delusional domestic terrorist.
1	I got vaccinated last week, Moderna. Zero side effects. Second shot in 2 weeks.
1	I got vaccinated with first dose 2 weeks ago and i feel great without side affects, i hope the second dose will be fine
0	I guarantee you..... the people who drop dead shortly After taking the Vaccines.... Would Still be Alive & Well if they did NOT take them
1	I had a 102 Fever, chills, body aches, headache, lower back pain for 2 days, etc. but I would do it again. It's better than having covid and NOT BEING ABLE TO BREATHE!!!
1	I had both Moderna vaccines and the Moderna booster. Nothing but great results. I am 75.
1	I had excellent experiences when I got both my shots. Very nice people. Barely felt anything when shots administered. Very professional, kind, prompt, thoughtful.
1	I had mine about two months now I don’t have no side effects thank god
1	I had my 2 shot vaccine covid-19...and it feel great, only arm sore,no big deal,...is a good feeling,my body is protective and I feel confident.....huyyyyy
1	I had my second booster today and, based on the information acquired from your very helpful videos, I asked the vaccinator to aspirate before injecting. I explained why and he was happy to do it. Thanks for all you are doing, keep up the good work.
1	I had my vaccines in the March of 2021 and did my embryo transfer June 2021. I’m now 8 months pregnant. And got my booster shot a few months ago. So far no complications
1	I had the Pfizer vaccination yesterday. Apart from a sore arm, absolutely no side effects after 30 hours.
0	I had the Pfizer vaccine but got very sick from the first shot. I couldn’t walk for almost a month. Still suffer from headaches and kidney pain
1	I had the vaccine yesterday and literally watched the microchip enter my arm. Now all I see is Bill Gates and Microsoft Windows, but not Windows 10, the shitty Windows Vista operating software. God, if only I'd listened to the Youtube comment experts!! I'm also autistic now.
0	I have a friend that took his son for shots and overnight the kid changed!! I saw it happen. I know it's true.
0	I have an extremely strong allergic reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine and I haven’t even had it.
1	I have had both series of covid Vaccines, I am still alive and well, with no side effects besides my arm is sore from the shot. I'm proud to say I am vaccinated against covid and also the flu.
0	I have more chance of surviving with Covid than with the Covid vaccine....
0	I have never nor will I ever trust the government. That's one place my faith will never go
1	I have never seen so many people in such a dither about taking a stupid shot. Where were your rantings and ravings when you took the pneumonia shot, the shingles shot, measles shot, pneumonia shot? Now, here's one that stands a very good chance of possibly saving your life and you act like someone's taking your firstborn!!!!! What an EXCELLENT example of how grown, intelligent people are expected to act.
1	I have stage 4 lung cancer, received my first round of covid-19 vaccine in December. No side effects other than some soreness in the muscle for a few days. I'll be receiving my second dose on the 26th. Just wanted to say thanks for all the informed info!
0	I have thecovid and have the antibody in my system. Why do I need a vaccine
0	I haven't taken any vaccination ever since it was rolled out.
1	I hope Suptnik V is granted for Emergency Use. ✌✌ https://t.co/KwYgsd5C29
1	I hope l can get mine soon l am 67 and have health conditions been shielded for 4 weeks can’t wait till I can go out again
1	I hope the vaccines will save all the people around the world. God bless you all out there
0	I just automatically assume people who get the vaccine barely have the IQ to push a broom.
1	I just don’t understand why they run to the hospital after getting sick. If you don’t trust them why are you there?
0	I just feel more confident when I can order one from my doctor vs getting it in a Wendy’s parking lot. That’s literally it. I just want to be taken more seriously considering we know nothing about this vaccine in the long run.
1	I just got mine today 🙌🏼💉🦠 my arm hurts right there on the spot. That means is working 💪🏼
1	I just got my Pfizer biontec vaccine at UNC and I was thrilled to see your information on this to know about the vaccine in my body! Thank you so much!
1	I just got my first Pfizer shot and as I'm sitting here with a slightly sore arm (utterly normal), I am enjoying understanding what is happening in my body as I type this comment.
1	I just got my second pfizer shot yesterday! I have been anxious about side effects but nearly 24 hours later and I haven't felt a thing. I'm so relieved! Excited to get back to living a normal life.
1	I just made my appointment for my first vaccine.
1	I just received my first dose today!
1	I just received the Moderna vaccine yesterday. No side effects except for a slight soreness at the injection site. I wish everybody can watch this video and hopefully everyone can get the vaccine when it’s available for them. We can get rid of this virus together.
1	I just spent an half an hour reading anti vax comments, I have lost faith in humanity.
1	I just want to thank them and every other scientist working on this around the world
0	I knew no vaccines has been effective anyway. I am not getting one.
1	I know it sucks, but take it from a survivor, the long term side effects of being moderately sick from COVID is so much worse, one year later still, than a couple days of crappy feeling from getting the vaccine.
1	I know more people who've been vaccinated than people who've had COVID. So happy to see the rollout gaining steam!
0	I know someone who was vaccinated and was hospitalized in serious condition
0	I know that manufacturers refuse to vaccinate with their own vaccines
0	I like my DNA exactly as God made it. No synthetic toxics and Nanotechnology into my body
1	I look at it as yes, there is some risk to the vaccine, since it's only been studied 3 months or so, but there is definite risk to Covid. I am high-risk so I'll chance it with the vaccine.
0	I love how people use “anti vaxers” as a way to belittle or dismiss them when quite frankly many of them have extremely valid intelligent arguments as to their stance.
0	I love how they had to admit here that it's completely experimental and not approved by the FDA, but they want to force you to take it.
1	I mean people should know that vaccines doesn’t prevent you from getting COVID. It only lower the risks of you dying having it.
1	I need covid shot, where I live I can't get one, I'm old and at high risk. that's why I can't get one
0	I never knew that not wanting to put unknown things in your body and being scared to get it cause you might get something, wasn't a good reason not to get it. Wow lol
0	I read some people have died from taking a shot.That is more scary than a cold/virus.
1	I really appreciate this information. My entire family had no hesitation getting doubly vaccinated, except for our 10 year old grandson. There’s nothing available for him yet. We will also be getting a booster shot next year. I wish people would wake up.
1	I received the vaccine yesterday! i am in healthcare. i have only had a sore arm and a slight feeling of hotness. other than that i feel great!
0	I refuse to get the shot also my entire family. Sorry will not try it.lol
0	I refuse up get any vaccine that's this new
1	I remember being amazed when the COVID-19 vaccine was made so quickly, and after watching this, I am even more amazed by how revolutionary this new way of making vaccines is. An applause to everybody who contributed in making and giving out these wonderful stuff.
0	I should be able to decide for myself if and when I need any kind of treatment or vaccine. This mandate is taking away our freedom!
1	I sometimes feel like antivaxers try there best to purposely get someone sick so they don't vaccinated how much sense does that make that will just make someone want to get vaccinated more.
1	I still think the odds are better than good and would take it. Send it to Ontario.
0	I still wouldn't get covid vaccine. It's too hasty and too soon.
1	I sure hope so. I WANT one.
1	I tested positive last Thursday. I felt tired for three days and played a lot of video games. Isolating from the rest of my family was a bigger chore than the disease. Vaccinations work.
0	I think I'll trust in my own immune system thank you. If I die from covid then it wasn't meant to be 🤷♀️
1	I think god just made covid 19 for eliminate all anti-vaxxers
1	I think the vaccine is ok.
1	I think they will probably make limitations for your daily life if you don’t take the vaccine so you will be kind of forced to take it :/
1	I think this is very helpful information. Unfortunately, in Japan, there are a few people who are skeptical about vaccines. I hope that the correct knowledge will spread.
1	I took both vaccines from pfizer and feel perfectly well, its my 10th day following the second shot. just a one day arm pain. Now its up to you, either get rid of the virus or let it mutate into something stronger so that all this is useless and we'd need to go back to basics.
1	I took my first dose of Pfizer's vaccine on Friday. I am happy.
1	I took the first Moderna vaccine 27 days ago. 14 days ago, my husband test positive for C-19 after he became symptomatic . My grandson and I tested five days later after my husband experienced symptoms. My grandson tested positive. I tested negative. I’am taking the second shot tomorrow! I’am a firm believer that the vaccine works!
0	I took vaccine from FLU when I was 10 with my brother it was so bad were seriously sick for 2 weeks very badly so since then don';t want to take any vaccines.
0	I trust my immune system more than the vaccines. So, No, thank u I better opt out for being a lab .
1	I used to be a Covid denier back in March of 2020, and thought it was some lame new strain of flu. It wasn't until one of my idols (Rick May) and relatives died of it that I started to realize this is serious. I'm so ashamed that it took people I looked up to dying to take this seriously. It's my biggest regret in life, I wish people would just listen instead of trying to be so self-righteous. Please everyone, stay safe, and like a good life. Update: I've now gotten my 3rd shot, and am hoping to be able to get the 4th. Stay safe, friends.
1	I want to be vaccinated
1	I was also one who worried about how quickly this vaccine was developed. In reality the scientists have used years...make that decades of research to develop it. When it comes right down to it, If we can’t trust science who can we trust? I’ll be ready to take the vaccine when my turn comes.
0	I was anti-mandate, not anti-vax, until the govt and media destroyed any trust I’ve had this past year.
1	I was born in 1951. The measles vaccine wasn’t developed until 1963. I got measles as did many of my friends. One friend ended up with heart damage and another went deaf. So you bet my kids were vaccinated on schedule. For everything.
0	I was gonna get it until a close friend of mine got the first dose & almost died so I’m good thank you
0	I was thinking about not getting it. But now that it’s being forced. I’m definitely NOT getting it 😂.
0	I will NOT be forced to take a shot.
1	I will definitely get it but I don't mind waiting a bit for the people who really need it to have it first.
0	I will die before I get this vaccine I don't trust it
0	I will die form a Covid-19 pneumonia rather than a blood clot from the vaccine.
0	I will fight to death and protect what Jesus gave me.. suffer first and have Eternal life in heaven
1	I will get it as soon as I'm able.
0	I will never take a coronavirus vaccine, there’s a reason why their blowing this all out of proportion
0	I will never take a vaccine that hasn't been through phase 3 testing. No one knows the long term effects of this.
0	I will never take dat poison!! You can have all my family’s doses!! Thank me later!!
0	I will never take it. And I had corona in Christmass week, very mild thank god! Natural immumity feels so good.
0	I will not be no one's lab rat !! Thank you .
0	I will not. I do not find enough info in the studies to trust
0	I will rather take care of my COVID and treat it I don’t have COVID but it’s really stupid cause it’s like they put crack in the vaccine I’m glad I don’t take it
0	I will take my chances on a virus that has a 99.6% survival rate
0	I will trust my immune system and living healthy, eating right, exercising, over drugs and vaccine which you don't even know the ingredients and side effects. Besides, if vaccines are really "safe and effective", why are vaccinated people getting sick repeatedly more than unvaccinated?
0	I will trust my immune system. no jab for me.
0	I wish I agreed but losing my sister after getting vaccinated leaves me suspicious and wary.
1	I wish this kind of videos is what the media told in the news. I've never felt so hopeful about COVID until this video. Well done!
1	I wish we could send people back in time to see what it was like when huge percentages of children died from diseases before they reached age 5. It would offer some much-needed perspective.
0	I won't be taking the vaccine especially after what the flu vaccine did to me I was sick for 6 months
0	I won't be taking the vaccine especially after what the flu vaccine did to me. I was sick for 6 months.
0	I won't take it no matter what.
1	I wonder how many people in the comment section are claiming this doctor’s lying. It’s like people would rather feed into fear than protecting themselves or others. Let alone getting things back to normal.
1	I work at a nursing home and I can’t wait for this to come out to us
0	I work in emergency medicine and would NEVER pump that poison into my body. Created in God's image, not about to change that fact.
0	I would NEVER consider myself an anti-vaxer but you gotta be out your damn mind to immediately take a vaccine that was characterized for being one of the fastest to make it through trials...
0	I would like to see doctors, politicians and rich people take the vaccine live on tv
0	I would never even experience those side effects you call "NORMAL"
1	I would rather deal with the issues of the vaccines than have my child die from those diseases that the vaccines have proven to prevent.
0	I'd rather die, than let them change my DNA.
0	I'd rather take my supplements...... you can have my share of the vaccine
1	I'll be getting my vaccine next week. I hope that fellow teens like myself can use the internet for good, and not spread misinformation. Get vaccinated everyone and provide your friends who may be hesitant with accurate information instead of ridiculing them
1	I'll happily take both vaccines if there are so many idiots who will forfeit theirs.
0	I'll hold off until all the beta testing has been completed and a true body count issued. Yeah, not expecting much in the way of the latter.
0	I'll take my chances with a 3 day cough instead of this vaccine.
1	I'm a habitually cynical individual. I had my first dose of your vaccine yesterday though. Suddenly there's light at the end of a long dark tunnel.
1	I'm a habitually cynical individual. I had my first dose of your vaccine yesterday though. Suddenly there's light at the end of a long dark tunnel. Thank you Pfizer.
1	I'm a nurse and I'm getting my first dose of Moderna tomorrow
1	I'm a republican but I believe in the science of modern medicine and I have faith in the science behind the physiology of the human body as well as the science behind the vaccine anti vaxers are just plain stupid
0	I'm concerned about the LONG-term effects of a vaccine. People seem to be focused on immediate reactions. Gotta think more deeply.
1	I'm getting my first dose of the Moderna vaccine today and this comes up. thank you for such an informative video
1	I'm getting my first dose tomorrow and I feels so nice to have the end in sight I could almost cry
1	I'm hyped for this vaccine, even if I grow a third limb
1	I'm in Portugal and I'll take the first vaccine made available as soon as I can get one, that's the least I can do in the name of those who lost their lives and didn't get a fight chance.
0	I'm in US: I will not be taking this fast-tracked no-liability experimental Emergency Use Authorization NOT FDA-Approved synthetic mRNA wrapped in PEG gene therapy injection.
1	I'm in for vaccination and booster shot and also wearing a mask at all times.
1	I'm just happy this vaccine exists. The numbers regarding allergic reactions are reassuring, and catching the side effects of the vaccine looks comparatively better than catching the virus.
1	I'm looking forward to the day(s) I get mine. Living in Europe however, it is unclear when this will be. Until that day follow advice and stay safe.
1	I'm needlephobic and I got my first vaccination. Scheduled for my second too.
0	I'm not an anti vax but I would seriously want to stay away from this vaccine for a few years because this technology of developing vaccine is never been used before.
0	I'm not anti vaccine but I have my concerns due to how fast they are being rushed out. I may wait a few months first
0	I'm not getting another. The second shot caused problems that lasted for months. I'm still not over the reaction to my booster. It's not worth it.
0	I'm not getting it for at least 1-2 years. And only if the virus evolves and it's necessary to have a base immunity
0	I'm not getting it... I dont trust you guys...✝️❤ nwo coming soon👍
0	I'm not getting the shot because i've never had a flu shot in my life. And I'm not about to have the worst 2 week experience when I know I won't get covid because I never hang out with anyone.
0	I'm not getting the vaccine I dont trust it .
0	I'm not kidding, you'd have to literally threaten my life in order for me to take any of these!!
0	I'm not taking it because the former Presidents will take it for me. It's funny how the mainstream media forcing and labeling people anti vaxx.
0	I'm not taking it, as it has not been trialled for long enough. Nobody knows the long-term effects.
0	I'm not taking the vaccine. I don't trust it. I'm not sick either & i have a strong immune system. No way vaccine
1	I'm not worried about taking it, but I already had covid, so it would be in better use for someone who needs it.
1	I'm so excited about the vaccine! I wish we could get it right now. This is fantastic news! Merry Christmas everyone! 🎆💖🎄☃️☮️😊
1	I'm so glad we finally have a vaccine to protect the people who actually need it out there, let's end the war covid-19 together with our vaccines
0	I'm so not getting it. Lol
0	I'm someone who NEVER gets allergies now after taking both doses I have ALLERGIES!
0	I'm sorry but a vaccine that was developed in such a short time cannot possibly have no side effects
0	I'm still not taking that evil vaccine
0	I'm still not taking this thrown together in less than a year vaccine... took me longer to plan my wedding
1	I'm vaccinated, everyone I know is vaccinated. 95% of my country is vaccinated. I don't see any negative effects of this.
0	I've already had COVID so why get the vaccine. That is what no one will explain.
1	I've been fully vaccinated and so has my husband. I must know at least 100 other people who have been vaccinated and everyone is doing just fine. You paranoid maniac. Don't believe us. We're just evidence.
1	I've been waiting for Novavax! Thank God they are finally giving us an option other than mRNA.
1	I've been waiting for the full approval, got my first shot scheduled for about an hour from now.
1	I've just got my first dose. I am proud of such used technology. Hope to see its effect in other ways.
0	I've tried to catch covid. The only corona I can find comes in a 6 and 12 pack.
0	I, my family, THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA are against THE OFFER with WHO, we are for leaving WHO, DOWN WITH FASCISM IN THE WORLD
0	IF SOMETHING IS FREE, THEN YOU ARE THE PRODUCT
0	ILL NEVER TAKE THE VACCINE
0	IM TERRIFIED OF GETTING THE VACCINE); I don’t trust the gov- it came out too fast. Iv been having panic attacks everyday if my job forces me to get one
0	IT IS AN EXPERIMENTAL VACCINE (the consent form tells us) YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO NOT PARTICIPATE IN THEIR EVIL EXPERIMENT! It's as simple as that. STAND FIRM AND FIGHT! God said don't ever get the shot ....pray and confirm in JESUS name!
1	Iam am pro-vax and don't want a rushed vaccine.
0	If 90% of infected have viable immunity why vaccinate them??
0	If I can’t sue them, I’m not getting the vaccine. Actually I won’t get the vaccine period.
0	If a 4th shot can't stop it, why would the previous 3?
0	If it is so safe, why do they tell us they will not be held responsible for any adverse affects.
0	If it was safe then why did my mom an fnp tell me 3 out of the four people who came in yesterday at her place of work who were diagnosed with covid yesterday were already vaccinated?
0	If it's going to take years anyway would it not have been better to just let it run its course?
0	If mRNA vaccines are totally new and have never been used before, why would the FDA think longterm side effects would reveal themselves within 2 months?
1	If no one decided to take the vaccine, we wouldn't make any progress!
0	If so impressed with the vaccine why hasn't the creator taken it and how impressive is it covid still infecting vaccinated people
0	If the COVID 19 vaccines are safe, why were companies like Pfizer and Moderna given total immunity from liability under the PREP Act? Count me OUT! TRY TO FORCE ME!
0	If the COVID vaccine is safe and effective why do the pharmaceutical companies have immunity from liability?
0	If the company is immune to being sued. Thats a super big RED FLAG
0	If the government is pushing you to take something into your body be aware
0	If their so safe, then why have the government made it impossible for these companies that make them free from legal action for vaccine damage ?
1	If they got covid because the refused to get a vaccine, I agree not to treat them
0	If they were so sure it was safe they would make it legal to sue the company
0	If this vaccine was truly studied and well researched we shouldn't have to even be asking this question. The fact that we are says a lot.
1	If we get enough people vaccinated in the entire population, there won't be as many people to care for infected with SARS-COV-2. Here's hoping we can get to that point sooner rather than later.
1	If you're still not vaccinated then I dgaf if you get covid.
0	If your immune system worked fine the first round why would you need to "boost" it with an experimental product that could introduce other harmful factors??? You are getting paid to say this aren't you? Come on... you can tell us we won't say a thing.
1	If you’re unvaccinated, you’re about 8 times more likely to be hospitalised with Covid-19 than if you’ve had both doses of the vaccine and the booster.
0	If you’ve done your research from the real scientists you would know never to take this experimental gene therapy! 1,000’s have been injured or have died! This so called ‘vaccination’ isn’t even approved by the FDA! If you’re listening to Fauci you’re forked!!
0	If “vaccines” are so safe and effective, then why aren’t they safe and effective?
0	Ill just quit my job and stay home to teach my kids and continue to grow my own food like we should be living while everyone else become part of the genetic dna altering experiment
0	Ill take my chances with covid, its working so far. I wont let my kids take it.
1	Im from singapore . Already vaccinated and i feel strong
1	Im getting my covid vaccine
0	Im going to wait for ten or more years and if people still around i will take vaccine then NOT!
0	Im not having it, no way
1	Im pretty sure plenty rather have vaccine then catch covid
0	Imagine a vaccine so safe you have to be blackmailed into taking it..For a virus so deadly you have to be tested to even know you have it....
0	Imagine a virus so deadly you need to be manipulated into taking the vaccine.
0	Imagine getting 4 vaccines in one year, still getting sick, and calling the unvaccinated people crazy
1	Immunization can be achieved as soon as possible after vaccination
1	Important point! The vaccine is working. It’s not because Omicron is all that mild
0	In Africa we don't want poison
1	In here so I can answer my relatives when they try to cast doubt on vaccine on me.
0	In the USA, you try to force this poison on us you better be prepared to eat lead.
1	Incredibly blessed to have gotten my second dose today. Feel lousy side effects but it’s worth it.
0	Infections in the United States are down by 44%. I believe that this is because everybody is already infected. The covid19 hibernates and the only way to detect hibernating covid19 is in the stool. So why do we need vaccines? Especially since masks and social distancing is still going to be required.
0	Instead of the population, why the same scientists who designed it, don't receive the first shots if they are so sure it won't risk their health?
0	Insufficient number of clinical trials
1	Internet moms: vaccines are safe-ish Well it's better than having your child dead-ish
1	It amazes me how many people would rather believe nonsense than the truth. People fear what they don’t understand.
0	It is not that people are against vaccination but most people just feel that the vaccine will be rushed and without any knowledge of the long term consequences.
0	It is still in TRIALS until 2023... we are the LAB RATS. Sick twisted people every single one with a hand in this.
0	It means the shot is poison, and the immune system is suffering.
1	It seems to me that there’s nothing about these vaccines that should cause problems. They’re mRNA delivery services. After that, it’s just the body/cells processing mRNA, as it always does.
0	It takes YEARS to find out if a new drug is safe.
0	It takes more than 10 years for the side effects to appear and how they are releasing within one year this is just making us fool.
0	It will mess up your DNA
1	It would be great to have a vaccine before contracting the virus. More conventional and similar to the flu shot.
1	It's gonna be like a fucking freight train. Once we pick up speed we're golden. Especially once Biden invokes DPA and it's all hands on deck.
0	It's one year since this virus started spreading so probably by now almost everyone have had it...no need for a vaccine
1	It's really important vaccinate all people in the airports of the United States. All people who travel to the United States. Thank you.
0	It's simple. If someone is pushing the vaccine, don't trust them.
0	Its gonna be a NO for me.
0	It’s a no from me, I will never get a vaccine, end of story!
1	It’s almost like, and stay with me here, but it’s almost like the vaccines work!
0	It’s an experiment on gullible humans.
0	It’s going to change our dna???! Yea no
0	It’s not safe and millions are going to find out the hard way down the road, a scientist on rumble explains why, it’s experimental and Not a vaccine at all. More have died from this thing then all vaccines in previous years.
0	It’s ruined my life, I was pro vax but the side effects are ongoing after 8 months and doctors are unable to help, not willing to report the effects. Sadly we will see that many won’t get the booster due to unreported side effects.
1	It’s so frustrating that we have everything we need and more to end this, but people are choosing ignorance.
1	It’s totally safe, they wouldn’t approve it if it wasn’t. Also the vaccine is based off other vaccine technologies that already exist that don’t harm people.
1	Ive been working as a volunteer trying to book people into get their vaccines, this video has some great easy to understand and relay information that I can let people know about so they feel safe and confident so thankyou.
0	I’ll be getting my vaccine on Neveruary 32nd.
0	I’ll never take this jab!!!
0	I’ll pass for now, stay on unemployment, keep wearing masks, laying low, and taking supplements for my immune system...while going to school on line...
0	I’ll take my chances with getting covid. I don’t trust our government AT ALL
1	I’m a week out of my pfirst Pfizer vaccine and pso pfar pso good. I haven’t experienced any pside effects, and I’m pfeeling pretty pfenomenal
0	I’m against this vaccine. I was referring to people who decide to get it just because of videos like this.
1	I’m conservative and I always wear a mask. I got the Pfizer vaccine.
0	I’m definitely not getting it !
1	I’m fine and I don’t know of anybody around here who has had problems with the vaccine.
1	I’m fully dosed!
1	I’m fully vaccinated and pro vaccine. I received moderna and developed disequilibrium a few days after my second dose. It’s been 5 months and it still comes and goes. Have 3 friends with the same issue after moderna. Maybe it’s unrelated. But I really doubt it.
0	I’m glad I’m not alone. I think I’m the only person in my company who has refused the vaccine. I will not take it.
1	I’m just glad I’m educated enough to not abuse my children by preventing them from being Vaccinated.
0	I’m never going to take that vaccine pfffff hell to the no
0	I’m not against vaccines at all. I am against a vaccine for Covid! It has a massive survival rate 99.777%! Eat clean and exercise I’m not taking a vaccine for Covid
0	I’m not an antivax I just don’t trust the covid one
0	I’m not getting this political vaccine
0	I’m not getting vaccine ever
0	I’m not taking an mRNA ever. It’s DNA ALTERING
0	I’m not taking the vaccine AND I’m not taking off my tinfoil hat!
1	I’m so pumped for the vaccine even though I despise getting stabbed by a needle.
1	I’m sorry America is privileged and DOESNT take advantage of these privileges where as other places are struggling to get this vaccine. I apologize once again.
0	I’m still not getting vaccinated
1	I’m watching this now and I just got my vaccine yesterday. I want to stay safe for my mom which has diabetes.
1	I’ve been in the ICU for my mother not related to COVID and I’ve heard the scream crying of family when they find out their loved one doesn’t make it because of complicated from COVID it’s heartbreaking. I wish people could just experience what it’s like on the frontlines to truly understand why it’s important to get vaxxed. No one in that ICU with COVID was vaxxed that should be a tell. Thank god for those nurses and docs ❤️ healing for everyone
1	I’ve gotten the vaccine. It is perfectly safe lmao
1	I’ve had my first dose of the oxford vaccine and can verify myself and family and friends who have had it had no serious side effects at all.
1	I’ve received both of mine! It’s nice to know I can protect myself, my patients and my family.
1	I’ve taken the moderna vaccine. I’ve gone on multiple 5 plus mile runs since then and everything is fine so far. After my first dose I felt extremely fatigued for a couple of days but that’s it. I get my second dose on July 3rd.
0	Johns and Johns is just a bad company lawsuit, now blood clots, I never us their products
1	Just because it happened to one guy, it doesn't mean it'll happen to every one of us. How many people die from medications for other diseases? Why hasn't that been put out on the news?
1	Just because vaccines aren’t perfect doesn’t necessarily mean they’re not working.
1	Just finished my first shift volunteering at the local Covid-19 vaccination centre and I got vaccinated as well!
1	Just got mine right now! Feeling great.
1	Just got mine this week, no side effects except some pain in my shoulder but it's not that big of a deal, like i hit the door or something
1	Just got my first Pfizer vaccine and it was very easy, it’s impressive the efficiency and organization I’ve seen at several of these vaccination locations.
1	Just got my first dose today. My arm is sore but I'm happy.
1	Just got my first dose u should really get the shot
1	Just got my first!
1	Just got my second dose Sunday and all I got was a sore arm. The next day I felt just the sore arm and by night time I was good. The next day all normal. Just get it done you’ll be happy and glad you’re done with already. Yes I was skeptical at first but because i have a comorbidity I got it rather than get covid and have 10x worse
1	Just got my second!!
1	Just got my vaccine Pfizer...no side effects.
1	Just got my vaccine today, couldn't be more grateful and excited, so far so good
1	Just got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine I feel great
1	Just had two days with high fever after my second Moderna shot. However, I won't complain, as I appreciate the privilege to receive this incredible high-tech product, which clearly initiated a strong immune reaction with the second dose.
1	Just signed up for my first dose, but really anxious about the side effect of it making me sick as im a type 2 diabetic that already takes forever to get over sickness, but hoping for the best
1	Just want to say thanks for explaining this! This really puts those numbers into perspective. And it's good to know that despite the difference in the numbers, each vaccine is safe enough to keep me away from the hospital or death.
0	Just want wish good luck to all the people out there participating in the experimental vaccine trial
1	Karens: "tHeRE'S nOThIng nAtUraL aBOUt VAcINes!1!!11" Immune System: *does 80% of the work of a vaccine*
1	Keep it going Moderna and thank you. Completely agree we have an engineering problem. We need the military to take over once these products come off the production lines and deliver the shot - no pun intended.
1	Keep making those doses. Good work.
0	Keep your poison
0	LAB RAT VACCINE DEPOPULATON PROGRAMME !
0	LIES - I wonder if you both can be sued? Keeping this if a family or friend die after taking this POISON!
1	Less than 1 in a MILLION side effects which is less than aspririne, less than having a plane fall on your head and even less than eating common food
1	Let's appreciate and applaud the doctors for helping us all
1	Let's get vaccinated!
1	Let's go Vax
1	Let's not forget the time people thought A&W's third pounder burgers had less meat than McD's quarter pounders. Numbers are hard for some people.
0	Let's see how the vaccinated do after weeks, months and years. It could come out over time that the mortality rate for the vaccine is higher than the virus.
1	Listen guys... I realize that some people have had adverse reactions to vaccines; but what you must realize is that it's generally a small minority of people that have any kind of severe reaction to a particular vaccine. If you weigh the benefits to the drawbacks, it just makes way more sense to get the vaccine, rather than risk getting Covid and having a severe reaction.
1	Literally just got my 2nd moderna shot 45 seconds ago! Woooo
1	Love the real information about why vaccinating people is a positive thing for us humans. This is actual research and not people assuming vaccination prevents COVID, it doesn’t. I still stand with people having their personal decision regarding the vaccine.
1	Love the vaccines. I think people should be encouraged to take as many as they can hand;e and boosters when they are available This is a great channel I heard that every doctor in the uk and every person working for the nhs and government and all the MP’s have had the vaccine and they’ve declared it publicly. (But I can’t find the website which shows this) So it’s obviously safe Thanks for sharing
0	MRNA vaccines have been tried and tested on animals for years, there was severe side effects on the animals, these vaccines were rushed trough the testing process...no MRNA vaccines for me thank you.
1	Mail it to me.
1	Man imagine being one of those kids that never paid attention in high school and now thinks that all science is fake and that this vaccine is some brainwashing poison made by the government. Crazy what happens when kids are raised to not respect nor value the exact science meant to keep them alive longer.
0	Man will now be like a desk top computer they will be getting injected with anti virus vaccines every after three months this evil is being pushed by an evil hand
1	Mandatory Covid-19 vaccinations are the way to go. Maximum suppression is the best approach to isolate this virus, and the only way to make it safe to reopen schools from kindergarten through college.
0	Many companies’ vaccines have been revealed to be defective
0	Many who will do their own research will never fool with vaccines ....
0	May have adverse reactions
0	Maybe moderna can tell us about the mice that died during the SARS COV -1 mRNA trials? And maybe a follow up question to see if they studied second time covid-19 exposure post injection because im just confused that they weren't concerned about all the mice dieing upon second contact of sars cov-1 after injection.
0	Me and my daughter will NOT be getting that garbage. Not gonna happen.
1	Me and my whole office did Sputnik-V. Half a year later no problem so far!
0	Met a man who’s 34 year old sister in law died 10 days after getting the vaccine. She was a police officer in Peru. Background that
0	Mmm for someone to say that vaccines are completely safe they are 100% liars because no medication or man made product is 100%
1	Moderna side effects are rough, but I ll take it over catching Covid-19 again. It sucks big time!!
0	Most are not anti vaxxers though, they just don’t want to take a shot that was made in 9 months.
0	My 29 year old daughter got the 1st shot & then bled for 9 weeks. She’s seeing doctors now & they have no clue how to help her. I guess that was just in her head!!!
0	My body my choice!
0	My body my choice! I would NOT put that poison into my body!
0	My body, my choice, and I'm not even trying to delete an unborn innocent.
1	My brother had (predicted) complications from his measles vaccine (and other vaccines) as a kid, but he had a somewhat underdeveloped immune system in his early childhood, so if he'd gotten actual measles, he would've likely died. He got a fever for a few days and was groggy for a while. Nothing else happened, except he didn't get sick from these horrible diseases. And he was somewhat of a worst-case-scenario and he's fine. Now he's 20 and healthy. Vaccinate your kids, peeps, or they may not make it as far as he did.
0	My children and I have all had our vaccines but my children or myself will not get the covid vaccine
0	My condolences to all those who got the vaccine.. We will miss you
0	My coworker just took the covid vaccine and his lungs immediately filled with liquid. He couldn’t breathe the next day and had to go to the emergency room. The doctor put him in a medically induced coma for 5 days to drain the fluid and now he has permanent lung damage.
0	My dad got vaccinated and he still got sick than ever before
1	My dad over age 60 is scheduled to get a vaccine within weeks, we'll get it later due to eligibility.
0	My dad works in an assisted living facility where covid vaccines were administered to every resident. Within 5 days of giving vaccines, 3 residents died. All were physically heathy. The facility, state, and vaccine company refuse to say the vaccine had anything to do with it. No media coverage either. There is massive silencing of covid vaccine related deaths around the world.
0	My exhusbands father just died 2 weeks after getting his 2nd shot. I'm good. I do not need to get the shot. I wear a mask and stay out of big public places. Take vitamins people... Stay safe!!!
0	My family and I don't believe of the vaccine !! So we pass !! We will never take them nooooooo wayyyyyy !!!!!
0	My family doctor died two days after Covid 19 vaccine but they said his heart attack was not related.
1	My family got the boosters. It saved us. Being immunocompromised is nothing to play around with.
0	My family is fully vaccinated but as for this experimental vaccine we're not going to take it yet we're young enough that we will survive if we get the virus and if it's safe we'll take it in the future
0	My father(a doctor) got vaccinated yesterday and he has been ill ever since. I’m honestly getting more skeptical of this vaccine because there have been many cases of people dying because of the vaccine.
0	My favorite famous boxer Marvin Hagler, who has stronger body than a German Panzer, has just died today after receiving the covid-19 vaccine
1	My first jab of the Moderna I had a sore arm for a couple of days. My second jab of the Moderna I felt like I had been run over by a truck. Well, maybe by a small child driving a go-cart. It was unpleasant, but not brutal. And I would do it again knowing what was coming.
1	My friend made fun of me for wearing a mask and my fear about covid. He got covid including his family. He got cured but His father died. His whole family under depression for months. Now they started again being ignorant. There is no cure for stupidity
1	My grandparents are vaccinated now
1	My household are fully vaccinated.
1	My husband and I are seniors. We have 4 children who have been thankfully vaccinated. None of our grandchildren have been. Two of our grandchildren have had Covid. They say they have antibodies and don’t need the vaccine!!! One is a travelling RN and does not want to be vaccinated. One is getting married and his future wife and he are not getting vaccinated. This is very disturbing. We will be masked at the wedding for our safety. The article is so informative and I will send it along to everyone including our entire family.
1	My husband and I were just boosted last week. Thank God we were. He tested positive for Covid early this week. It’s going around his workplace. He’s felt fine. Vaccines work!
1	My husband, my Dad, and I are getting our first vaccination tomorrow. We are happy to get it.
0	My immune system will be my protection.
1	My mom (75), my partner and i (42) all got the pfizer. Tired the day after but that was it.
0	My mom died a few days after taking the 2nd vaccine shot, this last Saturday March 27th. I’m completely lost. She was just fine
0	My mom said that I am one in a million, so, I'm opting out of cvid 19 vaccinations.
0	My mother got 1st shot of Pfizer hours later ----- same day had a stroke
0	My mother lost the use of her left arm and left leg within hours of getting the shot. She also became very sick. Her arm usage came back six weeks later, her leg still is not right. She now uses a walker. Sad. This from a healthy woman with no issues.
0	My mother took this vaccine on 3rd April and today is 9th she is covid positive
0	My mothers arm went numb after her first shot and she refuses to get second. A guys at works wife lost all her hair ....? Like are we just not hearing about some of these side effects cause they are forcing this on us.
0	My natural antibodies are the vaccine! I’m not taking anything that isn’t approved or tested on humans for a long period of time.
1	My parents all grew up during the 50s/60s. They all knew multiple families that lost children to measles. I was pretty much vaccinated for anything they could get me for and I am perfectly healthy. Vaccinate your children, it saves lives.
1	My parents got the 2-shot vaccine, they're doing perfectly fine c: I'm getting the vaccine next week!
0	My respect to all those that refuse this poison.
0	My son says so many of his health problems stem from all the vaccines he got in the Navy!
0	My state stopped using this vaccine period. I’m thankful for that
0	My turn? I am unvaccinated and untested and covid free for two years. Did I miss "my turn" ? Thank God.
0	My uncle took the Moderna shot on Friday March 12. He started feeling bad within 30 minutes. He died within 4 hours.
0	My understanding is you do not actually get immunity from this injection and it is not actually a vaccine...it is experimental gene therapy. No long term studies and never before used in humans....
1	My whole family and I had our vaccine. Slight headache and fatigue first dose of Pfizer but felt completely fine the 2nd dose. I recommend NOT to get the doses in the same arm! That will keep you from having the swelling or irritation. My peace of mind is something I haven't felt since this pandemic started...some actual hope and protection. Don't be afraid. You will be fine and you will feel so much better and the peace of mind alone is worth it.
0	NO COVID 19 HERE IN BURUNDI. WE ARE ALL WELL AND SAFE, EVEN THOSE WHO ARE COMING FROM ABROAD ONCE THEY REACH HERE THEY ARE COVERED WITHIN THREE OR FOUR DAYS, SO, THERE IS NO NEED TO BRING THIS SATANIC VACCINE. AWAY FROM US IN THE NAME OF JESUS.
0	NOT going to take this man's advice. No thank you. And NONE of these people have the RIGHT to force ANOTHER person to put something INTO their body that they do NOT want.
0	Nah.. nah..nah.. vaccine sounds so creepy to me, Boost Your own Immune System Peoples !!!
0	Naturally immunity is still the best medicine if you can. No to vaccination mandate.
0	Needing a booster every couple of months shows how shady this is, it feels like it is making the body dependent rather than independent
0	Neither safe nor effective. Enjoy your Poison.
1	Never in my wildest imagination would I have thought that a deadly virus could target a certain mindset....lol
0	Never taking it. I'm only one man's sheep, the Lord. Not a sheep to the government
0	Never wanted it, will never have it. My body, my right, and anything against that is against basic human rights.
0	Never will I ever get that vaccine LOL
0	New technology that's barely been tested, and the manufacturer refusing to take responsibility if things go wrong. I'm definitely not taking it
1	Nice video, it's gave so much of relief..now in India second wave is at peak, thousands of death daily.... I got vaccinated with covidsheild....feeling better after watching your video....I am safe... even I get infected after vaccination... No risk of hospitalization of death.... Thank you Nicely explained beautiful animation
0	No chance I'm taking it. Keep your toxins psychopaths
0	No liability for the manufacturers. Why anyone would play the lottery with their life is beyond me.
0	No long term safety data, no vaccine for me.
0	No need to ramp up production on my account.
1	No negative effects please get vaccinated
0	No one governs or tells me what to put in my body. Full stop.
0	No one is forcing me to take that poison.
0	No one knows the long term affects of the vaccine
0	No ones gonna take a rushed vaccine unless they want to die.
0	No thank you.
0	No thanks - the vaccine is more dangerous than covid for me
0	No thanks I'll see what people look like in 5 years who had the jab if they are still living!
0	No vaccine ever. You will not inject something I don’t want in my body
0	No vaccine for aids, cancer, but in one year y'all have vaccine for covid
0	No vaccines or mask. Open the country and start living again without fear.
0	No way am I getting hurt by Flu vaccines again! No jab for me!
0	No way, it is not a vaccine it is an experimental drug.
0	No you can’t force me and you will not! I will get a different job if my employer mandates it, which they are about to, so I’m already looking at the many backup options.
0	Nope enjoy you side effect crap
0	Nope, nope and nope............ not putting that stuff in me...........
0	Nope. This sounds like stuff from a sci fi movie. Telling my cells to make a protein it wasn't meant to make, to look like the virus. What could possible go wrong?
0	Not all of us are simple minded sheep like special interests were hoping.
0	Not enough time for data
0	Not in my body, let everybody else be guinea pigs..
1	Note what he said at the beginning and the end: we were able to get to finished vaccine because of all the research into other coronavira over more than a decade. They did not start from scratch!
1	Nothing terrifies me more than seeing the increasing amount of cavemen who are against science. I expect at least 14 replies about why I should be as well. I can't wait
1	Now if only the conspiracy theorists actually cared about facts.
0	Now lets watch the NHS get really overwhelmed with the side effect patients from the vaccine
1	Now we need a vaccine to stop the spread of stupidity as in antivaxers and antimask types! 🤣
1	Number 2 baby! Arm already sore #Vaccinate
0	Nurse is more afraid of vaccine than covid after working on covid patients..... what else do we need to hear really.
0	Of course they pressure parents & make them feel bad if you don't do it. Sick industry.
1	Of course vaccines aren't 100% safe. But here's the kicker: No medicine is!! They all have side effects, some more severe than others. It is always(!) a question whether the pros outweigh the cons.
1	Of course.Most of all to be a patriot and protect all other humans.
0	Oh yes must listen to the WHO. Owned by Bill Gates and both will profit heavily from these BS shots. Do your own research folks. There never was a pandemic. Look up total deaths by year for any country and the proof is right there. Total deaths in the US for example went down from 2019 to 2020. How exactly does that work during a “pandemic” it’s all about money, power, and control.
0	One doctor in Florida died after the vaccine but of course you won’t hear about it
0	Only 30 percent of Americans want to vaccine. The demand will drop soon enough
1	Only in America would people protest against getting a vaccine that would protect you and your family from a virus.
0	Only trusting in the Lord.
1	Out of all the people I know that got vaccinated, it was safe and quick for them
0	People are dying from the vaccines! Lord help us
1	People are so stupid nowdays, I can't believe random people in the comment section think they know any better than medical professionals that went through extensive education for 12+ years and spent even more time in this field.
0	People are waking up. After my cousin's son had his shots he completely changed. They gave him more shots than he was due because he had been sick and was behind. I know it was the vaccine that changed my baby cousin forever no one can tell me different
0	People died already and other waiting tried to survive.
0	People need to research this crap. Good luck sheep
1	People who are unvaccinated are 97 times more likely to die from covid than those fully vaccinated with a booster!! Get your free, easy to find vaccines today!
1	People who refuse the vaccine should have to pay private for COVID treatment. These anti vax morons are so thick I doubt they can spell their own name without deep, deep thought.
1	People who refuse to get vaccinated are like people who refuse to wash their hands after using the restroom.
0	People who refuse to take the vaccine are the 21st century Rosa Parks.
0	Pfizer has no liability, and they are immune from prosecution. Let that sink in.
1	Planning on getting my vaccine shot really soon!
1	Please announce early as possible that vaccine is free far all please.
0	Please don't get the vaccination, it's nothing but pure evil! Çhrist said "to He that endureth til the end,shall wear a crown of gold!"
1	Please get vaccinated and safe yourself and orhers
1	Please get vaccinated. Vaccines aren't political. Although this one is not 100% perfect, it will keep you out of the hospital with near certainty.
0	Please save us from people who claim to care about our health at the same time medically rape us thru injection filling us with POISON
0	REMEMBER IF YOU HAVE A SEVERE SIDE EFFECT OR DIE YOU CANT SUE
1	Rather than attempting to shame those who've been offered the vaccine, support and encourage them. After all, as more people get vaccinated, the better it will be for everyone--including you.
1	Received my 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Friday and besides a little injection site pain I’ve felt no symptoms.
1	Received my first Pfizer Vaccine yesterday evening, woke up with nothing but a sore arm, fatigue and a slight headache. Nothing a little over the counter medicine won't help! Definitely prefer these symptoms vs the alternative!
0	Remember, you still have to wear your mask if you're vaccinated 🤡
1	Sadly, there's no vaccine against stupidity.
0	Safely vaccinated? How on earth has any long term safety data been compiled? The only thing that's accumulating is wealth in the pockets of the already-super-rich.
0	Say NO NO NO to getting the vaccine.
0	Say no to vaccines!!!!
0	Saying the vaccine is safe is NOT true though..
1	Science is real!!!!!
0	Scientific evidences? Who provides scientific evidences? The same that sell you the vaccine :-) Hahahaha
0	Serious question: Now that even the government is admitting the vaccines do almost nothing to stop the spread of Omicron, what is the "scientific" justification for vaccine mandates in the workplace?
0	Side Effects "You just might die" lmao
0	Simply because it's not a cure. It's an experimental gene therapy jab. It doesn't matter if you have it or not makes no sense.
1	Since I treat COVID patients three days a week, totally worth it.
0	Sir I'm so much scarred to take vaccine
1	So everyone is freaking out about 6 people out of 7 million. Ok
0	So glad I’m not going to be taking the vaccine.
1	So happy to have had my first covid vaccine
0	So if i die from vaccine it,that doesnt matter as long as i am protecting others by taking something that might kill me??
0	So let's see same shots same outcomes same problems same injuries same medical conditions same autism but vaccines no connection LOL
1	So much people are concerned but my mother and sister and their coworkers took the vaccine and had no symptoms other then a sore arm which is reasonable and if you are scared just wait to see the outcome
1	So sad to see the people saying no to the vaccine when they barely have an understanding of medicine.
0	So when I say, "y'all are guinea pigs, don't get mad. For y'all taking that poison. Fat meat is greasy, and sugar is sweet. Can't say ya wasn't warned.
0	So yesterday were halting shot,but today were promoting shots. Lies! Me and my kids aren't taking this toxic concoction.
0	So you Knowillingly are injecting the public with toxic poison then?
0	So, when someone dies before vaccination, it’s due to COVID-19 and something must be done to prevent it; but when they die after vaccination, they die of natural causes and no preventative action is necessary...interesting.
0	So...who's still going to get any of the vaccines? Glad I didn't!
0	Some employers are making it mandatory to get it or be fired. I would have to be fired, cause I'm not getting it.
0	Some side effects are normal like death
1	Sounds useful. Reliable protection for people willing to get the vaccine sounds great. As for antivax cranks, they're gambling with other people's lives and I am long since out of sympathy.
0	Stand strong! No vaccine.
0	Stay away from me with that crap!
0	Still never taking this poison shot 🖕
0	Still not putting that shit in my arm.
0	Still not touching it with a barge pole - sorry! Have done too much research of my own. See the research of Celeste Solum and Deborah Tavares of Stop the Crime.Net for the truth.
1	Stop panicking the word here is "rare"! As for the people not now going to have the Vaccine because of this risk, do you or your partner still take the contraceptive pill? As that is known to also cause blood colts!! Everything runs a risk!
0	Such lies! It’s all toxic crap injected into your body- which will bring about unhealthy side effects! It’s so sad seeing the world buying into governmental mind bending world alternating facts. The truth is out there people but you need to use your God given brain!
1	Sure hope there is a great cure fer it an hopefully there isnt anymore coming . it is a real bad thing . Stay home everyone if you can please.
0	Swine flu vaccine has caused narcolepsy in a good few people in Ireland, recent case settled linked below. There wasn't nearly as much pressure (or profit to be had) to be first to market with that vaccine compared to that of Covid now. I'd definitely be slightly hesitant to be first in line for a Covid vaccine.
0	Take the vaccine then the real health problems begin. These sheep never learn.
0	Take your shot and deal with it's side effects, why are so many willing to take it when they don't know anything about it? and if you die or have side effects they aren't liable...You forgot to mention the chip to verify you have gotten it.
1	Taking the vaccine will safe people
0	Tell that to the people who have died from the vaccine.
1	Tens of thousands of people die yearly from medical mistakes and drug reactions but people afraid of vaccines
1	Than you Pfizer for your vaccine. Please make a booster so that we're protected from these other variants.
1	Thank God we have videos. Because one thing I’ve noticed about anti-VAXer’s, is that they seem to possess low reading comprehension skills. Video is probably the best way to go about educating them.
1	Thank god its working
1	Thank you ,Doctor. You were thorough and put my mind at ease regarding the vaccine. I wish I had a doctor like you who explained things with so much passion and compassion.
1	Thank you Darwin for weeding out these stupid selfish people who don't get vaccinated. They threaten all the rest of us.
1	Thank you Moderna!!
1	Thank you Pfizer for your tireless effort and determination to help the whole world.
1	Thank you baby Jesus for the mRNA vaccines
1	Thank you for destroying antivaxxers and covidiots with logic and scientifical evidences. To be honest, I feel so impressed on how scientists and experts can develop vaccine for COVID-19 faster than ever, thanks to medical science and technology that advanced farther.
1	Thank you for making this video to clear up the misconceptions people may have! Im from Texas, USA, and a lot of healthcare workers have been administered their first dose (yay)!!!
1	Thank you for the information I got my first shot yesterday (Pfizer) and I feel like total crap lol. I did have COVID and it was way worse than this.
1	Thank you for your vaccine. I was able to visit my 98 y.o. grandma for the first time in 18 months.
1	Thank you... I feel encouraged to now get the vaccine... I appreciate the explanation ...
1	Thanks I really needed this because I haven’t been able to see my grand parents so I finally will
1	Thanks for creating this video! There is so much misinformation being spread about the disease and the vaccine, and you have made it very simple for people to understand. I hope this helps to dispel some of the fear people have of this vaccine.
1	Thanks so much, for the info on vaccines.
1	Thanks to both of you for the great information. Where can I find more information about getting vaccinated in my state? Az
1	Thanks to vaccine million Life was safe
0	Thanks, I have change my mind seeing your video. I will not have the JAB, you have convinced me ;)
0	Thanks, this only confirms that C-19 vaccines can be dangerous.
1	That newfound mRNA way to create a vaccine, salute for the scientist!
1	That newfound mRNA way to create a vaccine, salute for the scientist! And thanks vox for explaining it so well so easy to understand
1	That shot was so quick and smooth
0	That the spike protein is “harmless” is highly debatable.
0	That's a no from me dawg.
0	The Covid vaccine is basically that medicine that does more damage than it fixes
1	The Covid-19 Vaccine safe life thanks god it came out
0	The Vaxx is poison it's a death jab
1	The anti vaxxers are stuck In a dangerous cult. It's a hard one who will I listen to a medical doctor with years of experience or someone with no medical training. Yeah sure a small number of people can have adverse reactions it's sad but this is a tiny percentage. Vaccines have saved so many lifes.
1	The anti-vaccine movement needs to let their insurance company know. When they catch COVID and get hospitalized, they will pay their own bill!
1	The biggest Vaccine side effect is that you might just live long enough to experience your first breakup
0	The bigiest lie in history
0	The death rate of being injected with AstraZeneca is fast compared to being infected with covid19 and recovery through our God given immunity. Choose God and not a false hope - AstraZeneca
1	The delta variant has a 1,260 times more transmissable rate than the original covid 19 virus. Therefore there is more likelihood of more infections. Vaccination with 2 doses has shown to be an effective barrier against a severe case of covid.
0	The fact it became available within a year is terrifying. Probably going to do more harm than good.
0	The fact that Big Tech and Gov and Pharma along with Tik Tok nurses have combined forces to shame the world into taking this cocktail is enough reason to run from it
0	The fact that those vaccine makers have legal immunity tells you everything you need to know about those toxic warp speed concoctions.
0	The fact the government has to keep using various methods to convince us that the vaccine is safe to take makes me never want to touch the damn thing
0	The fact you are unable to sue the company’s if damages Happen is all I need to know
1	The fastest way out of this pandemic is through mass vaccination. This INCLUDES children. We can't vaccinate children without safety data - & to do that we need children in trials. If you have an adolescent interested - here's info about Moderna's trial.
0	The four types of vaccine are: 1.) An dangerous, unnecessary, & untested one. 2.) An dangerous, unnecessary, & untested one. 3.) An dangerous, unnecessary, & untested one. 4.) An dangerous, unnecessary, & untested one.
0	The government dont give AF about any of us!! All this is so fishy that its scary!
0	The government intervened in the promotion of vaccines, which made the vaccine lose a certain degree of credibility
1	The infection rate is 30k ish a day. Our vaccination is 20x better. Eat that COVID!
0	The money from the Vaccine has sure saved their family, it just dosen't prevent infection, or really do anything else.
1	The more people who are vaccinated, the more lives will be saved and the less the virus is in circulating the lower the chance of variants developing. It is right and sensible to take up the offer.
0	The more they try to convince me to get it the more my gut tells me not too
0	The next morning, Ching’s pharmacy was bombarded with calls from people anxious to be vaccinated. He had no shots left.
0	The only thing worrying me is that gates funds 5g AND vaccines. Do the two work together. Is it a frequency thing. Phone + 5g + vaccines.
0	The point is you can get infected and recover without a vaccine, so why should I take it when there are no guarantees both ways?
1	The problem nowadays(maybe always was like that idk) is that everyone is having an opinion but barely anyone did real research. Thanks for this video
0	The problem with this vaccine is that it sounds really shady and I don't like stuff that is shady.
0	The real virus is in those vaccines
0	The right to control what enters your body is absolutely and unquestionably a basic human right.
0	The same people who have gaslighted and lied to us all these years are now pushing this rushed vaccine HARD. I’ll take my chances with the 99% survival rate of covid
0	The same people willing to take the Vaccine are the same people that will only buy organic foods because they don't trust the foods that agencies like the FDA and USDA or basically the government says are perfectly safe to eat with the GMO's ,artificial fillers, antibiotics , etc but now believe anything the government tells them?
0	The scariest thing about all of this is how naive and ignorant people are, they buy anything the media throws at them.
0	The vaccine brain damage has already got these people.
0	The vaccine causes blood clots in your brain and if u get a blood clot in ur brain ur going to die it causes so much more than just that and even if u get the vaccine u are still immune to getting covid dont get the covid vaccine or u will die.
1	The vaccine has a low probability of side effects
0	The vaccine is definitely some kind of thing to destroy the population
1	The vaccine is effective against the covid19
0	The vaccine is not safe, and is not approved. They are pushing for such quick fda approval because they want to silence this argument. Only reason.
1	The vaccine is safe... study the ingredients, do research on the ingredients
1	The vaccine is working well
0	The vaccine kills people.
0	The vaccine will be the real virus...
0	The vaccine will change your DNA forever
0	The vaccine will not protect you from any virus in any way. Even the flu vaccine doesn't protect people from becoming infected with influenza, actually the people who are getting the flu shot very often have worse symptoms when subsequently infected by the virus than the unvaccinated people.
0	The virus is fake. The hospitals are empty. The doctors' surgeries are empty. The test centres are empty. The scamdemic is a fraud. Resist fascism!
1	The worst part is the anti-vaxxers.
0	The 💉 is experimental. Good luck sheep
1	There also needs to be urgent outreach to young people saying” I don’t need the vaccine , I’m healthy You are healthy, until you aren’t
0	There have been cases of facial paralysis here in the UK
0	There is absolutely no need for vaccines to extinguish the pandemic. I've never heard so much nonsense talked about vaccines.
1	There is no excuse for not getting vaccinated.
0	There should be more measures or schemes to improve our immune system rather than getting injections to prevent diseases.
0	There's nothing wrong with not wanting to have an injection, we don't need, and don't know is safe.
0	There’s no way they’re putting this Dragon piss in my arm!
0	These are not vaccines in a traditional sense. They are playing with your genes.
0	These vaccines are so new and millions of people ran out and accepted them, may god be with us all
0	They are forcing me to take that poison!!
0	They are getting really pushy - how many times do people have to say "NO".
0	They are not telling us the truth and people are just lining up for this....
0	They are pushing this to hard.... And when you see doctor and health care workers not getting it..... This entire thing has me thinking something not right
0	They can stick it where the sun don't shine.
1	They know the vaccine is safe already. They had to trash its reputation in order to stop demand for something they simply do not have due to their useless preparations.
1	They need to focus on vaccinate everyone above 55 like ASAP. Even in third world countries bc that thing keeps goin around around and who knows wth is gonna turn into. And old ppl are the most at risk, once theyre vaccinated they can give it to younger ppl and get that virus under control.
0	They need to shut up and know the covid vaccine is unhealthy and had not been tested that well.
0	They set themselves free if it kills you by having you sign you "understand the benefits AND risks" meaning you understand it can kill you. NTY I'm not doing it.
1	They should be vaccinated to be safe from COVID
0	They're missing the point - it's not about whether or not the vaccine works; it's your right to deny it if you wish, because it's your body.
0	They’re going to blame the vaccine side effects on other “covid variants” meanwhile everyone will be dying off by their own stupidity for taking the vaccine. Don’t be fooled.
1	This bridge is 99.7% safe to cross. Anti vaxxer: I'll swim instead
0	This demon can’t even keep viruses out of windows, now he wants to vaccinate the whole world. oh my god, somebody wake up!!!
0	This is a experimental vaccin , you are the experiment.!
1	This is by far the best news since the vaccine came out imo. Even if the vaccine just partially stops the spread, it's still great news
1	This is fantastic engineering work. Way to go, biotechnology.
1	This is good news! I can see this is the beginning of the end of this pandemic. Hopefully, this virus will be completely eradicated by next year including the new variant.
1	This is incredibly reassuring. My sister and her boyfriend both just got J&J and I was a bit concerned for them, that they wouldn't be as protected as me or other people who got Pfizer or moderna.
1	This is objectively very fucking good.
1	This is probably THE best video debunking anti-vax claims. While the first one isn't quite well after Pfizer got approved last month, it still holds pretty strong so thanks!
1	This is smart and I just got my vaccine today
0	This is why it is better by far to go through proper extended testing instead of rushing in to mass vaccination.
1	This kind of educational videos about the vaccines should be aired all over the world and over mass media so that we can finally not be so afraid of the vaccine and collectively have a positive attitude towards getting it and beating this pandemic
1	This should be required viewing for every person who doesn't want to take it because they think the vaccine (for Covid19) is a hoax
0	This vaccine is affecting my health in various ways I never felt fever in my life but after this vaccine.
0	This vaccine was quickly pushed through without knowing the long term effects or short term effects.This is a big no no .
1	This video definitely helped me because I heard someone talking about a conspiracy theory with the covid vaccine and I started to get paranoid but now I see that they are just crazy
1	This video made me feel so much better about getting the vaccine. I suffer with an anxiety disorder that causes hypochondria and I’ve been given so much misinformation from family and online that has scared me to death to get it. Now I feel guilty looking at other countries that are suffering because they don’t have it. I’m getting my first dose today because of you. Thank you so much.
0	Those that choose not to get vaccinated are actually people with brains and can think for themselves. It's not about covid.
0	Those were my symptoms of covid. Not getting the vaccine.
0	Those were not intelligent people because they did not give valid facts or good reasons why they're not interested. My reason is simple ( the shot has things in it that disrupt the immune system ) , plus I have an immune system thats strong and works. ( Sunday April 4rth 2021 Happy Resurrection DAY )
0	Thumbs DOWN.......DONT TAKE IT...
0	To all my unvaxxed brethren out there: HOLD THE LINE!!
1	To the people scared of needles, I got my last vaccination a while ago! Neither of them hurt, you can feel a pinch and after that you can’t even notice the needle is in your arm! My arm hurt and I had a slight headache about a day or two after, but it’s definitely not nearly as bad as Covid!
0	Today I stopped my monthly donation to Unicef. I don't want to support your vaccination program for Covid-19!
0	Today I stopped my monthly donation to Unicef. I don't want to support your vaccination program for Covid-19! Instead, use the money for things people need- like food, building homes, clean water etc.
1	Today is my birthday and I couldn’t have asked for a better gift then to break all these vaccine records, awesome news!
0	Today's vaccine propaganda message
0	Too much is not known about covid-19. This shot is too new.
1	Took mine no side effects at all just arm was a little sore
1	Took my first dose today in Illinois, feeling good!
1	Took my first part of the vaccine, didn't feel a thing...
1	Trump lies even when the truth will do. The tens of thousands of lies he has told that his adoring followers believe (a fair share of those lies being about COVID-19) has so polluted the Republican Party that it has morphed into America's Fifth Column. The reluctance by his followers to get vaccinated is based on lies told by him and other Republican politicians, and not only puts all of us at risk, but all of the world's population at risk. Moreover, there has been evidence that mammalian animal species such as cats (big and small), dogs and minks can be infected with COVID-19, aka SARS-CoV-2. While these animals currently do not seem to become seriously ill or even to die the possibility exists that they could become reservoirs or vectors of the virus that they could then pass on, possibly as a lethal variant, back to humans. Mississippi, wake up! America, wake up! Get vaccinated!
1	UNICEF you are doing and distributing vaccines booster COVID-19 make for more confident and safe for people.Thank you so much.
1	Unvaccinated kids are just speedrunning life
1	Unvaccinated people over 65 in the US had a 52x higher rate of hospitalization from Covid in December than people in the same age group who were up-to-date with their vaccination. Get vaccinated and boosted!
0	Useless vaccine , Nothing more than business
1	Vacations are wonderful.
1	Vaccinate the working population first and the teachers get the kids back to school and the people back to work it makes more sense before we all die from starvation
1	Vaccination can stop this pandemic
1	Vaccination is a human right .
1	Vaccination is great way to build our immunity. It's a only one way to fight against corona virus. Make sure to protect our society
1	Vaccination is literally the reason that we don’t have to worry about smallpox and polio
0	Vaccine and illuminate sign this vaccine is number 666 sign that if you have no this vaccine 666 you can't buy a sell Satan program. Don't agree this .
0	Vaccine injuries have numbered in the millions.
1	Vaccine is the best way
1	Vaccines and medications aren’t destroying humanity, no — it’s the anti-vaxxer community’s complete ignorance and misinformation that’s destroying humanity from being able to save itself.
1	Vaccines are our best tool in the fight against COVID-19. If you haven’t yet, please get vaccinated and get boosted.
1	Vaccines are really good for you.
1	Vaccines are safe
1	Vaccines are wonderful. However, I will wait a bit before getting this one. Many different vaccines for COVID-19 and Astra Zeneca one has been halted.
1	Vaccines can have a certain effect
1	Vaccines can help to improve your immunity
1	Vaccines can't fight COVID-19 when people are unwilling to take them.
0	Vaccines do not cause autism. Sure. I have autistic daughter. When she was 8 month she was vaccinated (6in1). Next day she got fever, she got normal after 3-4 days. But after 2 weeks she stopped to laugh, look in the eyes and play with her toys. She became quiet, kind of thinking inside. Now she's 10 yo. She can't talk and shows typical autism symptoms. I've done her hair analysis and it clearly showed that after vaccination the level of aluminium in her body raised multiple times above secure levels. Continue to lie.
0	Vaccines don't work. You can still get the virus., you can still die from it. Just like with the flu vaccines. So what's next?
0	Vaccines have harmful ingredients such as baby cells, mercury, and so on. It’s not meant to reside in a humans body
0	Vaccines have never been Double Blind Placebo tested. WHY? The only pharmaceutical used on mass where this is the case. WHY?
1	Vaccines help boost immunity
1	Vaccines save lives! Please don't hesitate to be a part of this universal fight against #COVID19
1	Vaccines save lives.
0	Vacination is NOT the best way.... Heathy diet Vitamin C, D3 and Zinc is the way out..... WHO you said one can still be infected with the virus even if you get the jab. So why should people take d jab..the only reason there is push for d vaccines is selfish interest of few men who want to control the world
1	Very rare 1:100,000 to 1:600,000 risk of clots with vaccine
1	Very well said as the proper treatment will save the lives of millions of people.
0	Vitamin D. Zinc. Vitamin C and others are the way for me.
0	WAKE UP!! THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT OUR HEALTH!!! BEING SICK IS A BUSINESS $$$$
1	WELL THANK GOD FOR THIS VACCINE
0	WORD OF THE LORD: DO NOT TAKE THE VACCINE. PEOPLE WILL LITERALLY BECOME ZOMBIES WITHIN THE NEXT 5 YEARS!!! Pray and confirm before you mock and scoff!
0	Was diagnosed with the new coronavirus after being vaccinated
1	Was finally able to get my first dose Wednesday, feeling good no side effects
1	Watching this after getting my first dose of Moderna Vaccine!
0	We all been told 10 months ago: use sanitiser and wear face masks, and everything is going to be okay. And what happened? Nothing! We all still sitting at home, without jobs, loosen our businesses. And you telling us now again: use vaccine which was tested couple of months, and everything is going to be okay. No thanks...)))
1	We are all in this together you good little citizens!
0	We are good here in Africa, don't bring your immune destroyer here. What happened to the American senator that took the vaccine yet test positive to covid19 ?
0	We are just guinea pigs. This is what you get when you put murdered baby material into people's arms.
0	We are witnessing the largest clinical trial in the history of medicine, and with so many willing participants!
0	We as the people need to fight back by not taking it n if they try to force it that means war time
1	We can do it! I'm literally sitting in the waiting area after getting my first shot right now!
0	We don't need a "vaccine" for something with a 98% survival rate!
0	We have all had some vaccines throughout our lives yet none of them left us bedridden for two days with uncontrollable chills and 102 fever that is not normal I am sorry
1	We have the tools we need to protect ourselves from severe COVID. Please get your free COVID-19 vaccine and booster. It could save your life or someone you love.
0	We need to STOP calling these things "side-effects" !!!!! They ARE EFFECTS !!!!!!!
1	We need to take care of our body! Take vaccines, sleep well, exercise, do not smoke, not drink too much and eat right and drink water only as much as possible.
1	We weren't asked to go to war and sacrifice our lives. We were asked to protect ourselves, protect the vulnerable and get a needle. Pretty easy decision for me. Triple vaxxed and proud to be part of a loving, caring society.
1	Well you've got more chance of catching Covid and developing severe blood clots from that than you do from any vaccine. FACT.
1	What a convenient timing, I’m getting my vaccine today, this helped me feel a lot more excited Update: just got my first shot and I’m feeling great! Thank you Ted for sharing this important message and I wish everyone a great day, except for the anti vax people commenting here. Stay safe!
0	What really is important are parents that are wise enough not to subject their children to such "treatments"
1	What's frustrating is if I sent this video to the anti covid vaxxers I know they would disregard it claiming is brain washing or you are just plain wrong, or you are lying for some reason. I ask them what the difference is when they send me their informational videos? They claim their information is right, I ask how they know that. And that is usually when they stop replying to me or they send me another link.
0	When some of these vaccines only have 60% effective and they do not protect against strains they are not meant for. Not getting one.
0	When the most evil people on the planet are telling you to be a good neighbor and get a "safe" vaccine, run like a kid who's just been offered a lollipop from a strange man in a van!
0	When the truth finally comes out, you can’t unvaxx your kids.
0	When you eat something it is mandatory to have the ingredients on the label when you get a vaccine questioning what the ingrdience is taboo because if you understood you would never agree to injecting poison into your body
0	Where is the vaccine control study?
1	While I wasn't doubting the vaccine, this cleared up my confusion on the differences between the vaccines. I really appreciate this video. We're almost there!
0	Who else got fired cause refused to get a covid-19 vaccine?
0	Who else is packing up for this zombie apocalypse
1	Why are people anti-vaxxers? I don’t get it
0	Why do we even need a vaccine for a virus with a 99.98% recovery rate?
0	Why do you have to explain this over and over is it even worth it? Here in Zimbabwe we are using natural remedies and have proven effective so far so good
0	Why get a vaccine when it is proven that you can get the virus again even after the vaccine. I would rather get the virus again and not get a dirty old vaccine.
0	Why not speak about the long term affects of all the covid vaccines? Because nobody knows for sure
0	Why should we get vaccinated and boosted? So we can still catch Covid AND take a risk of experimental drugs with zero long term studies performed? No thanks.
0	Why would a healthy fit person need to take it of whatever age when it has been created in less than 8 months not knowing long term side effects.
0	Why would u ever let urself be vaccinated
0	Why would young healthy people get a vaccination for a virus with a 98% survival rate?
1	Wife and I received our pfizer today, and nothing but a sore arm.
0	Without a doubt, if it happened to him it can happen to me. I am sure he never thought he'd have adverse side effects before getting vaxed, but he did. Until we learn more about WHY some get adverse effects while others don't, I will remain unvaxed
0	Won't be going anywhere near this poison!!
1	Woohoo! Just got home from getting my second shot (Pfizer)
1	Would have loved it more if it had dedicated more explaining about the mRNA part, cause that’s the part antivaxxers use to spread fear.
0	Wouldn't take it if my life depended on it. Because it doesn't.
0	Y'all stupid if u think I'm a take a vaccine
1	YES literally couldn't get signed up fast enough once it opened up to me. I did it to protect myself, others, and the baby that was growing inside me at that time
0	YOU CANNOT FORCE ANYONE TO GET THE COVID VACCINE ANYONE ATTEMPTING TO DO THIS WILL BE SUED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW AND THAT MEANS EMPLOYERS ESPECIALLY!
1	Yay! I get the J&J Tuesday! Can’t wait!!!
0	Yea right, no one knows the effects of this new vaccine product, long term especially. The world is the project.
1	Yeaaaa had my vaccine today, halfway to freedom I hope, side effects with everything, its a chance you take.
0	Yeah it’s dangerous for us to think outside public opinion... that means we’re probably doing something right
0	Yeah passing on all of it.
1	Yeah, it's really difficult to choose between trusting a doctor with several years of studies and a Karen that googles things and spreads misinformation on Facebook
1	Yes Vaccine is "LIFE SAVING" Thank you.
1	Yes! Everyone associated with healthcare needs to be vaccinated. Thank you.
1	Yes, please let the public know that our scientists and medical professionals are working hard for the good of the people! ALL PEOPLE!!
0	You can expect blood clots
0	You can have my dose.....keep that experimental biological agent. If I wanted to participate in a clinical trial, it would be for something legitimate....
0	You can have my shots since you are so confident.
0	You can still pass and catch corona so that among many other things is why I’m not taking it
0	You couldn't pay me to take that poison
0	You don't have to be an "antivaxxer" to understand the stupidity this year
0	You don't need to be vaccinated against a virus with a 99% recovery rate!
1	You guys are ok to be a little scared, it's a new kind of vaccine but it should be fine.
0	You have to sign a waiver before you take it saying that you won't blame the government or the medical office if something goes bad or you get deathly ill from it. But yeah, seems pretty safe to me.
1	You just convinced me to not be picky about vaccines. Thank You!
1	You know right now we really need a covid vaccine right now
0	You know, I think I'll sacrifice myself to this horrible disease so that someone more in need can have my vaccine
0	You protect them by not getting them vaxed

1	You should make vaccines As early as you can
0	You take it and all your friends and family. I'll see what happens at least 5 years down the track. 30 years research on these types of vaccines, no success, in less than a year, success, bingo, suspicious????????????????????
0	You're all lairs and' very unfair and' so unfaithful to the peoples' worldwide's pleasing bill gates and melinda gates' hates crimes just for money

1	i was down for 2 whole days after second vaccine. at that time i was in bad shape, and i was happy i got it. if i got the real infection , it would have been much much worse. so better to suffer for 2 days than in breathing help machine for months.
1	i've had 2 shots. no reaction at all the 2nd time. makes me wonder if i need to get another shot later this year. like, in the fall or late summer.
0	if they're saying that we are too many on the planet., can you really trust these people coming up with a vaccine from a man made virus?
0	if you’re smart enough and have a clear mindset, you won’t get vaccinated. if you wanna play russian roulette have fun and take it.
