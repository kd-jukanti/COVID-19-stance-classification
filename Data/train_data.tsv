0/-1	1. The peer-reviewed medical studies on the efficacy of masks at preventing the transmission of viruses all conclude that-- They Do Not. 2. The CDC's PCR testing amplification cycles were set to 40 cycles and at 33 cycles, they still couldn't detect any live virus, meaning that there were MILLIONS of false positives. 3. Looking at the way the numbers were collected, analyzed and reported-- I realized that it's asinine to lend any credibility to any of them, as their failure to collect relevant data has fatally flawed the ability to have an accurate account that meets any sort of unbiased scientific standard, making the data-- by definition-- unreliable. 4. "People that are asymptomatic can spread the virus while appearing healthy". Seems to be the concept driving mask mandates, however; Asymptomatic individuals have NEVER been the drivers of Outbreaks, Epidemics, nor Pandemics-- EVER, in the history of airborne viruses of ANY type. I'm not aware of any conclusive unbiased data which shows the breakdown of the transmission rate of asymptomatic SARS-covid2, c19, influenza, swine flu, bird flu or any other... relative to being the driver of an outbreak that rises to the level of an epidemic or a pandemic. Link? Crickets... 5. We've had flu vaccines for decades and the flu and flu deaths are still with us-- And, we didn't have lockdowns and mask mandates for that and we shouldn't for the same reason with this, Especially considering that the current treatment has a success rate of 99.7%. Panic over .3% is the act of someone who's unhinged and bordering on Paranoid hysteria

1/1	100% true and real. Getting vaccinated is a safer way for you to develop immunity from covid. 19. Rather than getting infected by the virus. Due to ignorance so many citizens are falling infected under covid.19 and experiencing difficulties. So to avoid such inconvenience its much more better to take a vaccine two doses for avoiding risk of Corona. Don't believe such innocent persons beliefs and take vaccine atonce.please.

0/0	14 obvious crucial questions about the Covid vaccines ‚ÄúThey‚Äù originally promised the only way back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù was a vaccine for coronavirus. ‚ÄúThey‚Äù obviously lied. Fri Jan 29, 2021 - 8:26 pm EST January 29, 2021 (LifeSiteNews) - According to the government... If I get vaccinated: 1.- Can I stop wearing the mask? Government Response - No 2.- Can they reopen restaurants, pubs, bars etc and everyone work normally? Government Response - No 3.- Will I be resistant to covid? Government Response - Maybe, but we don't know exactly, it probably won't stop you getting it 4.- At least I won't be contagious to others anymore? Government Response - No you can still pass it on, possibly, nobody knows. 5.- If we vaccinate all children, will school resume normally? Government Response - No 6.- If I am vaccinated, can I stop social distancing? Government Response - No 7.- If I am vaccinated, can I stop disinfecting my hands? Government Response - No 8.- If I vaccinate myself and my grandfather, can we hug each other? Government Response - No 9.- Will cinemas, theatres and stadiums be reopened thanks to vaccines? Government Response - No 10.- Will the vaccinated be able to gather? Government Response - No 11.- What is the real benefit of vaccination? Government Response - The virus won't kill you. 12.- Are you sure it won't kill me? Government Response - No 13.- If statistically the virus won't kill me anyway ... Why would I get vaccinated?" Government Response - To protect others. 14.- So if I get vaccinated, the others are 100% sure I'm not infecting them? Government Response - No So to summarize, the Covid19 vaccine... Does not give immunity. Does not eliminate the virus. Does not prevent death. Does not guarantee you won‚Äôt get it. Does not prevent you from getting it. Does not stop you passing it on Does not eliminate the need for travel bans. Does not eliminate the need for business closures. Does not eliminate the need for lockdowns. Does not eliminate the need for masking. So...what is it actually doing? You haven‚Äôt forgotten that ‚Äúthey‚Äù originally promised the only way back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù was a vaccine for coronavirus. ‚ÄúThey‚Äù obviously lied. In addition, a number of prominent leaders have lately been insisting there will be no return to normal. They are now very open about saying that everything has permanently changed to a ‚Äúnew normal.‚Äù Klaus Schwab ‚Äì founder of the World Economic Forum ‚Äì makes it very clear in this excerpt from a talk by him. Everything that we are going through right now, including very dangerous, catastrophic lockdowns, will remain with us forever. Dr. Simone Gold talk below) that are not allowed to be used, is their excuse for this dramatic, imposed change on the entire world population for a virus and for the large majority of the population. Their supposed solution of the ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù covid vaccine, as you can see from the above list, is not really a medical solution at all. It is not only not effective, it is increasingly looking to be unusually dangerous for an alleged ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù, which it is not. Dr. Gold has recently given one of the best talks to date on the virus and dangers of the ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù vaccines. Everyone should watch this talk. It should be promoted around the world. So, again, what is the real purpose of these vaccines? They have already told us ‚Äì control of everyone to impose a New World Order/4th Industrial Revolution. We will all be required to have a vaccine passport or digital proof of vaccine, just as in Communist China, in order to enjoy already God-given rights and freedoms. Democracy and national sovereignty will be taken away and replaced by rule by a small, very powerful and wealthy elite. Everyone needs to stop watching all television and newspaper news and actively organize to oppose this world tyranny. Anyone who believes any of their propaganda and goes along with it is making the biggest mistake of their lives.
0/0	15 days to flatten the curve didn't stop the tyranny. Wearing masks didn't stop the tyranny. Lockdowns didn't stop the tyranny. Taking the vaccine didn't stop the tyranny. Compliance isn't helping you.

"It won't stop you from getting Covid-19, it won't stop you from spreading Covid-19." So will somebody please explain how it can be seen as "highly effective". It's highly effective at making certain people extremely wealthy, but what else? Take a look at Britain's latest re-hospitalization figures for Covid-19 infection, for people who have been double-vaxxed. The official figures reveal, it's the worst it's ever been and getting worse! So the myth about the reduction of hospitalizations after vaccination has been blown off its pedestal by the blunt facts.

1/1	@Marcos Aur√©lio If you don‚Äôt take the vaccine and get infected, you‚Äôre giving the virus another chance to mutate towards something new that the vaccine can‚Äôt protect other vaccinated people from. If the new virus that evolves in your body spreads again, the pharmaceutical company won‚Äôt have readily studied vaccine against it. In another sentence, the vaccine would be outdated, if there‚Äôs such a mutation. Therefore, by not taking the vaccine, you could be aiding the virus in its evolution and forcing everyone to go through the pandemic again. I hope this answers your questions.

1/1	A known medical exemption including but not limited to allergies to any of the ingredients of the vaccine and a religious exemption providing that the individual is a member in good standing with an established faith tradition that eschews various medical interventions. Your individual beliefs independent of such a religious body would not count, as there would be too much room to abuse that. Otherwise, no. get the shot, and quit looking for excuses.

1/1	A lot of people are being sarcastic about the vaccine, but shortly there will be real benefits to taking it, such as convenience in international travel (immunity to quarantines), not to mention if you go on business trips to China, your company will likely require you to take the vaccine anyway. You'll know what I'm talking about if you work at an international company.
1/1	A lot of people aren't at risk of dying from the flu, but we tend to get flu shots. It helps those that ARE at risk and also happen to fit in the small percentage where the vaccine doesn't work.

0/-1	A lot of people just don't like having things shoved down their throats without their consent.
1/-1	A lot of people know or think this covid 19 vaccination is painful is because of other type of vaccinations like for example the vaccination for the little children when they are 3, 4, 5, or 6 months old so they won't get a virus, sickness or infection. the little children vaccination hurts or feel painful when these children get it and if you want to know because of other type of vaccinations that is not for covid 19 people really think is painful , so people are not getting a covid 19 vaccination that easy
1/1/1	A lot of people seem to understand vaccination as *only* personal protection, when in fact it is *mostly* societal protection.
1/1	A lot of people who are against the vaccine are like "I cannot trust the people who encourage you to take it" and I always respond with "Then do you know more than medical professionals?" because the only people who are against the vaccines are not doctors.
1/1	A lot of these diseases were eradicated until the most recent dangerous trend of not vaccinating kids, and cases of measles were reported in the US.

1/1	A medical professional who opposes vaccination violates her, his or their professional knowledge to a degree that it puts that professional competence into question! It stands to reason to ask wether that person opposes other medical standards like disinfection before medical procedures. It would be prudent to monitor such staff for adherence to prescribed medications and medical treatments of patients. There is a decisive difference between freedom of choice and harmful incompetence!

0/0	A severe allergic reaction, like anaphylaxis, may happen after any vaccine, including COVID-19 vaccines.
1/1	A shame we have to wait six months to get it, but good news regardless.
1/1	A significant feature is... it is a single dose vaccine.. which will make vaccination campaign wide spread and relatively comfortable to do. Will add impetus to our war on pandemic .

1/1	A success rate of 75% is pretty good. The Flu vaccine, which many of us have regularly without questioning it, is generally only 40 to 60 % effective. I don't hear the DM causing a fuss over that!
0/0	A true vaccine prevents you getting the disease you are vaccinated against. The covid shot at best reduce severity of symptoms, but do not prevent disease spread
1/1/1	A vaccinated child is better than a dead child, for all those wonderful angry people
1/1	A vaccinated person can heave a big sigh of relief for the reason that at least for a year he can be free from getting infected. He/she would feel and experience a big burden getting off-loaded. This feeling is infectious as others too get a confidence, a boost and need not be worried or bothered about close interactions or indulging in activities with such persons. This way the spread can be put on a right leash. A stitch in time saves nine.
0/0	A vaccination and a mask, see how easy it is to brainwash people! They will hide behind these forever! They do no good, you would think a light would go off!
0/0	A vaccine NEVER EVER tested for its link to autism caused my son to regress into isolated autism.
0/0	A vaccine a preparation containing live, attenuated or inactivated (killed) microorganisms (or some part or product of them), that is used to stimulate an IMMUNE RESPONSE in the recipient, which gains IMMUNITY. Only due to the state of "emergency" are these allow to be called vaccine. There is no proof that either of these do either. Who will take the blame for all these deaths for with holding HCQ from us?? Follow the money!!
0/0	A vaccine against something that doesn't exist .... oh dear we are getting desperate
1	A vaccine cannot cause COVID-19. No vaccine contains a complete form of the virus responsible for this illness. While their body builds immunity, it is normal for a person to experience minor side effects.
0/0	A vaccine conceived, developed, tested and approved in less than a year--what could possibly go wrong?
0/0	A vaccine court would not exist if vaccines were totally safe.
1/0	A vaccine does not only prevent severity. Ie there is no vaccine that does not effect cases but makes the cases less sick only. For example this would never happen.2 groups of 1000 people one getting vaccine and the other not. Both groups show 100 cases of the viral illness. IE no difference in prevention. But those 100 who got the vaccine are less sick. So cases aren't prevented only severity.No vaccine works this way. Vaccines prevent infection. Although we do look at hospitalization and death prevention sometimes because that's what we want to vaccine to prevent. However of it does prevent severity of world have to do so by preventing cases too.A vaccine does not circulate through the body like an antibiotic that treats the illness if you happen to catch it. That's not a thing.

0/0	A vaccine? No thanks.
1/-1	A vaccines efficacy rate is calculated in large clinical trials, when the vaccine is tested on tens of thousands of people,those people are broken into two groups: half gets the vaccine and half get a placebo. Then , they are sent out to live their lives, while scientists monitor whether or not they get covid-19 over several months, and how those people fall into each of these groups determines a vaccines efficacy.

0/0	Absolutely not. Although SARS-CoV-2 appears to be a slightly nastier virus than usual, it‚Äôs not anything to panic about. The world has gone absolutely nuts about this, but if you study the science, dig into the situation, you‚Äôll realize that what we have is panic and not a dangerous virus that calls for extreme measures. The ‚Äúcure‚Äù has been far, far, far worse than the disease.

1/0	Absurd. Only people who aren‚Äôt vaccinated are getting hospitalized. Quit punishing the smart ones.
1/1	According to CDC website: "Vaccinated people can still become infected and have the potential spread the virus to others, although AT MUCH LOWER RATES than unvaccinated people.
1/-1	According to a CNN article: "In Moderna's trial, 15,000 study participants were given a placebo, which is a shot of saline that has no effect. Over several months, 90 of them developed Covid-19, with 11 developing severe forms of the disease. Another 15,000 participants were given the vaccine, and only five of them developed Covid-19. None of the five became severely ill." I do not know much about about vaccines, but that seems absolutely amazing.
1/1/1/1	According to health experts, there could be regular side effects expected after a vaccination, such as muscle aches. But similar to other types of vaccines, COVID-19 vaccines undergo trials and testing involving thousands of volunteers...
0/0	According to history vaccines don't work. When I came to this country I had to be vaccinated did it work? no, not even the flu shot works just to make money. One day judgement day will come when God judges all these greedy politicians.
0/0/0	According to lib science there's 969 genders and men can have menstrual periods. I am Not going to trust their "science."
1/1	According to the CDC's 2017 report, 91.5% of children aged 19-35 months were vaccinated against MMR, 92.7% against polio. Vaccination acceptance is way more universal than the internet's portrayal of vaccination rates
1/1	According to the WHO, "there is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from Covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection."
0/0	According to your own data the covid 19 vaccine is the deadliest vaccine to date
0/0	According to your theory all the unvaccinated staff will die of covid anyway and the vaccine IS killing people not to mention heart issues strokes clots. Imagine being vaccinated can STILL be really ill/die of covid AND have the risk of adverse effects!
1/1	Ace, thats 2 vaccines with over 90% success that dont have a rare clotting side effect
1/1	Achievement unlocked. Shot number two in the books. Thank you science!
0/0	Active immunity AKA natural immunity is way safer than vaccines because there are no potential side effects having the sickness but then you conquer it and you never get again
1/1	Actor Sonakshi Sinha's message is loud and clear: Vaccine is our biggest weapon in this ongoing battle against the #COVID19 pandemic. Sonakshi joins us in our mission to encourage all adults and adolescents (15-18) to get the #SurakshaKaTika against the virus. Watch, share and get vaccinated today! Register on cowin.gov.in
1/1	Actually a lot of the people in my country had the sputnik vaccine and it works pretty well! Even my mom who is a doctor told me its not bad
0/0	Actually here in London 75percent of NHS doctors and nurses have refused the vaccine so please educate yourself beyond one video lol
1/1	Actually it‚Äôs effective, just some delusional people that think vaccine prevents you from getting the virus or having a small chance to even die from it when you have prior health problems.
1/1	Actually my friend had no adverse effects after the injection
1/1	Actually the opposite. Vaccine is safe but even mild cases of COVID can leave people with Long Covid which can be debilitating for many .
0/0	Actually the risk is the other way around. The vaccine is higher risk. There are safe, effective treatments that have nothing to do with vaccination.
0/0	Actually this vaccine is the best way to get Covid not prevent it.
0/1	Actually, 0% of Americans or anyone else have gotten the vaccine. Instead, they got a covid shot. Vaccine is supposed to prevent infection
0/0	Actually, COVID-19 caused less mortality than the flu up until around the 15-24 age range last year. Measles has been identified to have an IFR of around .5% in children, whereas COVID is estimated around 0.003% for 0-19.
0/0	Actually, mrna has NEVER been used on humans, a quick Google search will show you that. And yes, I know its been used in trials BUT never actually used on humans.
0/0	Actually, no one in the world should take it.
0/0	Actually, not being sick means your immune system is working. There is nothing normal about injecting this crap into your body for a supposed ‚Äúvirus‚Äù that has a 99.7% recovery rate. FFS How does anyone believe this nonsense?
1/1	Actually, the vaccine does help stop you from becoming seriously ill with the virus, and substantially reduces your likelihood of infecting others.
1/1	Actually, we NEED #Vaccine .
0/0	Add another measure to the chart... deaths from corona vaccine...anyone who dies 28 days of having a vaccine..
1/1	Add to the number of people in the community who are protected from getting COVID-19 ‚Äî making it harder for the disease to spread and contributing to herd immunity
1/1	Additionally mRNA vaccines have been USED in cancer therapy successfully.
1/1	Admittedly my plan was to wait on a vaccine so I could get the good one rather than the first one however with the 1st seemly to have a 90% effectiness perhaps the 1st is the correct choice. I have two risk factors and my county has a 15% positivity rate so might be of the essence.
0/-1	Adults are just acting like cry babies about having to be vaccinated to participate in certain activities.
0/0/0/0	Advance R.I.P. to those who will take covid vaccines.
0/0	Advance rip for takng vaccine

0/0/0/0/0	Afraid of vaccines? No, I‚Äôm afraid of a vaccine that they complete in less than 6 months. Gee, what could go wrong?
0/0	After 2 Doses vaccinated people test positive again. Not helpful.

0/0	After a long time of supporting the vaccines after my younger brother showed me statistics that show it actually can have really bad side effects .
0/-1	After a very very long time people have started to speak up on a mass level, consciousness is rising

1	After being pinged a week ago, I‚Äôve stayed negative. Feeling grateful for my armour of triple vaccine + mask.
1/1	After doubts were raised about the safety of the Oxford vaccine ( what we call Covishield) the UK immediately imported 1.7 million doses of the Moderna vaccine and is already injecting people. That‚Äôs the kind of pro active approach our Covid czars need to follow
1/-1	After getting my first COVID vaccine, I can confirm it gives you 5G. My phone bars have increased exponentially and I've even activated augmented hearing. Well worth the effort it took to finding a vaccine.
1/1	After getting the pfizer vaccine i was so happy but the pain in my arm was bad but thats aight
1/1	After getting vaccinated, you develop immunity to that disease, without having to get the disease first.
1	After going through the last 11 days I would hands down take the vaccine immediately to prevent what I just went through.
1/1	After having covid I'll definitely have the vaccine. I wouldn't wanna go through that again
1/1	After infection individual illnesses are not the same. Getting vaccinated beforehand will help with sickness from other serious illnesses.
0/0	After its hospitalised my mum, I'd say no....
1/1	After looking into the AZ vaccine all the world medical authorities have come to the conclusion that that only clots they have discovered are called the EU and Macron. They will be the cause of many deaths in Europe
0/0	After months of waiting, the autopsy report today CONFIRMS that BBC journalist @LisaShawRadio died from the vaccine. We were right again.
1/1	After more than twelve billion doses being given it's proven to be statistically safer than air travel.
1/-1	After my first dose (see previous post for details), I thought maybe I got the side-effects ‚Äúout of the way‚Äù.

0/0	After one day the safe vaccine caused an issue, not known or tested for............
1/-1	After reading some of these comments I would urge vaccine makers to develop one that has a high level of stopping people being idiots
1/1	After reading up some more, I feel encouraged to get the vaccine.
1/1	After receiving my second vaccine dose on Monday, I can say that having fatigue and a headache for less than 24 hours was completely worth it.

0/-1	After some days we will have movie on corona may be titled as covid19 and will break all the records till now.

1/1	After taking vaccine, there were no side effects affecting normal life.
1/1	After the first shot, everything was fine, just my arm was sore a bit.
0/0	After the many years of walking around in this human body, I have come to realize that no one will ever force a good thing on you.
0/0	After the second covid shot I became impotent forget it I am not taking any shots anymore .--
1/-1	After the shots, you might experience a sore arm, a mild fever or body aches, but this doesn‚Äôt mean you have COVID-19. These symptoms, if they happen at all, are temporary, usually lasting only a day or two.
1/1	After the vaccine is injected, your body uses instructions in the DNA/RNA to make copies of this virus part (or antigen). Your body recognises these and mounts an immune response, ready to protect you the next time you encounter the virus.
1/1	After the vaccine, there were no side effects affecting normal life.
0/0	After these fast releases of the vaccines I am starting to doubt more things about the health services in general. Am I the only one?
1/1	After this explanation, I'm ready to cancel my vaccine appointment. Just kiddingüò∑
1/1	After waiting 2 weeks for the vaccine to kick in, I joined up with some vax‚Äôd friends for some long-awaited tabletop throwdown. I didn‚Äôt realize how badly I missed in-person gaming, but now I can‚Äôt wait until we have Covid under control so we can bring back conventions safely
1/1	After watching this and a few other videos I definitely feel safe taking this vaccine.
1/1	After watching this video I found out that several of my family members who are unvaccinated had gotten covid and since then one has died today actually. One other is fighting with pneumonia on oxygen. It's true this is serious and it's real. I'm praying that people will realize that the vaccine saves lives. üôè
1/1	After we passed 100 million vaccinations in the EU, I‚Äôm very glad I got my first shot of #COVID19 vaccine today. Vaccinations will further gather pace, as deliveries are accelerating in the EU. The swifter we vaccinate, the sooner we can control the pandemic. #StrongerTogether
1/-1	After we're vaccinated, must we still wear a mask to protect those who have not been vaccinated?
0/-1	After what we‚Äôve seen and experienced and learned in the last 18 months I wouldn‚Äôt trust any of these people as far as you can throw them
1/1	After you get the first vaccination, your body is reving up the immune system and ready to fight COVID if it comes.
0/-1	After you get your booster, you're going to need another one. After that one, you'll need another. Eventually, it'll be the side effects that get you, not covid. It's a roll of the dice either way.
1/1	Again, VERY VERY HAPPY I GOT THE VACCINE, LOVE ME SOME VACCINATION, but whoooo boy, last night was ROUGH. That second shot does NOT play, and I'm very glad I'd already put stuff in motion to take today off completely.
1/1	Age adjusted data say vaccinated are 23x less likely to be hospitalized for covid19.
0/0	Age from 0 to 130 should not take a vaccine
0	Agenda 21! Do not trust the government
1/1	Agree - everyone get vaccinated and get boosted I have. Never thought any of my family would test positive until my niece did. Thinks she picked it up at the supermarket, that`s how easy it can be contracted. She is well now, lesson learned - "take no chances".
0/0	Agree 100% with her there is no covid pandemic they have just renamed the flu i am not having vaccine or testing
1/1	Agree completely. Vaccination is the best way to develop an immunity system. And continue to follow safety protocols
0/0	Agree with you. The testing is suspect...the advertising ridiculous. People should decide for themselves. Ill wait.
0/1	Agreed!...we, (those who are vaccinated), can comfortably enjoy attending the above mentioned venues even more without worrying about passing COVID or getting COVID. Their loss, our gain!
0/0	Agreed. I'm not personally vaccinated because I already had covid, and I'm not personally willing to take the vaccine and have a small chance of side effects. I feel good about my natural immunity but I made sure to encourage my parents and older inlaws to get vaccinated simply to reduce symptoms when they inevitably got covid. (They all did after vaxxed). The idea that the vaccine is a tracking device or whatever else is moronic, but the vaccine that isn't a vaccine fell flat on its face and now it's about control. I'm not anti-vax I'm anti mandate. I don't care what definitions Websters changes.
0/0	Agreed. I‚Äôm not going to be pro-Covid vaccine because Trump says. I‚Äôve never cared what Trump did or didn‚Äôt do as long as he left me the fuck alone, just as I wish Biden would. I‚Äôm also not scared and don‚Äôt wear a mask, etc. I had Covid.
1/0	Agreed. Too bad we got putin's puppy as president, which i'm sure he will try to make money off the vaccine for himself.
1/1	Ah well, Let those of us who want it, get it and let us empathise with the families of the rest as we read about their funerals .
0/0	Ah yeah.. JnJ, the company giving u cancer with the baby powder...lol.. y'all hurry up and get those vaccines!
1/1	Ah yes I CAN NOT WAIT for anti vaxxers to reject the vaccine and then all die, at least it would take out the retards who believe in everything thing they hear from one guy or one side.
0/0	Ah yes, no vaccine has been successfully created for the common cold, SARS, or any other coronavirus; but I'm sure this rushed vaccine made in 8 months is perfectly safe AND effective despite a minimal testing period or available studies on long term side affects.
1/0	Ah yes, the Karen‚Äôs have come together to make the ultimate cringe
0/1	Ah yes. These televised vaccines has really convinced me to inject it into my own body. Thank you for posting!
1/1	Ahh inject it into my veins as quickly as possible! It is a well known fact that most anti vaxxers are actually just scared of needlesüòÇthey‚Äôre babies

0/0	All 3 vaccines are dangerous. The only safe vaccine is not yet available. I am not taking any of these vaccines. I'm willing to wait few more years for the safest vaccine. Its better dying from a virus then to take an unsafe newly invented vaccine that i don't trust. Thanks
1/1	All COVID-19 vaccines currently available in the United States have been shown to be highly effective at preventing COVID-19

1/1	All Cdns need to read this. The group is mostly made up of otherwise healthy athletes, mostly under the age of 30. This #BrazilVariant needs to be taken seriously. We need to distance, mask, vaccinate & reject #antivax #antimask activism.
0/0	All I am going to say is my grandma and my grand-grandma as well as my grandpa all died well OVER 90 and in peace, solely by trusting God and not seeing doctors for most of their life.
1/1	All I can say is give me the shot. I could care less. Herd immunity helps decrease the number of variants on this virus. The more the merrier is so TRUE.
1/1	All I can say is take the vaccine!!
0/0	All I can say with 100% confidence is that I won't be the only one who dies when they come trying to force it at my house

0/1	All I‚Äôm saying is you can‚Äôt chant ‚Äúmy body my choice‚Äù and then support a mandate without being a hypocrite
1/1	All anarchists should be pro vax. We're not 12 year olds who do the opposite of what our parents say just because. Vaccinations are safe and administered in the majority they protect the weakest, which is a clear case of solidarity. We do it not because it is mandated or encouraged by the government but because we help our fellow humans
1/1	All and all so unbelievably happy to be vaccinated!
0/0	All animal studies done with this type of treatment Die'd when introduced to the virus ! This vaccine is step one to population control !
1/1	All antivaxxers are morons
1/1	All antivaxxers should be castrated so that they do not breed
1/1	All approved COVID-19 vaccines have been thoroughly tested, and all provide a high degree of protection against getting seriously ill and dying from the disease.
1/1	All are free to refuse #vaccination, but not free to compromise our right to health and life with stupidity and lack of compassion for others right to life. Our right to health #trumps rights to freedom of speech, choice, right to sickness etc #Covid_19 #vaccination #Rights2022

0/0	All credibility has been lost! The truth might salvage a little bit, but y'all need to decide what's more important, the truth or your job... Bcs one is going to ruin you for life!
1/1	All drugs have side effects, but the benefits far outweight the possible risk.
0/0	All drugs/vaccines go through this process. Initially they are safe, effective wonder drugs. Then after months/years/too often decades drug/vaccine found to be ineffective, dangerous, eventually withdrawn/banned. I have described it as 'The Ages of Drugs'
1/1	All evidence is still pointing to the fact that the AZ vaccine will stop the majority of people getting seriously ill! I will be having it when offered!

0/0/0/0	All is a big lie!!!!! Good luck if you survive a few years after getting vaccinated.
1/1	All medications carry risks. Don't want it? Don't get it, simply as that really. As for me, fill me up.
1/1	All my coworkers reacted to their shot within 24 hours, so when I had no reaction during that time, I thought I was in the clear. But, nope. 36 hours later, I was in bed alternating between chills and feeling like I was burning up. 48 hours post vaccine, all better! Worth it.
0/0	All my friends who took the shot got covid. I haven't and I have not gotten covid. Taking the vaccine gives you covid!
1/1	All my grandparents have been now vaccinated against Covid in Chile! Super happy and hoping that everyone will receive a vaccine in time!!!

1/1	All of my children and grandchildren had their vaccines with no problems AND no diseases! I am a believer!
0/0	All of my family members are not vaccinated. We all got covid . All we experienced was cold symptoms for a few days. We did not need the vaccine to survive. I have friends who are vaccinated they too got covid they're experience was the same except they risked the side affects of the vaccine
0/0	All of my vaxxed and boosted co-workers are going out sick with covid. It‚Äôs ridiculous... unvaxxed have to work extra and pick up extra shifts and job duties.

0/0	All of this hasn‚Äôt been studied long enough, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not getting it
0/0	All of this should have been answered before the vaxxxines were released. We had several extremely effective treatments that were block so big pharma could make fast billions.
1/1	All parents have a responsibility to their children and society to have them vaccinated unless there is a real contraindication. The proof is there and is easily available.
0/0	All poison period.

1/1	All the anti vax covid deniers crying about a 0.0004% chance of a bloodclot from the #AstraZeneca vaccine after spending a year saying they refuse to 'conform' to rules over a small chance of catching Covid. Looking forward to my 2nd AZ dose in the next couple of weeks.
1/1	All the anti vaxers told me i was gonna get all these horrible symptoms. 3 months later and i feel nothin
1/1/1	All the anti vaxxers should be able to live on an island where they can freely contaminate one another with joy. The reason people born in the 70's and beyond don't have polio innoculation scars is because the vaccine WORKED
1/-1	All the credit go to scientists...not the golf and tweeter king.
1/-1	All the dislikes are ignorant people.
1/-1	All the doctors i've talked to have said that getting the vaccine is a good idea, idk though...all these people on social media tell me i should be worried. Idk who to trust more...
1/1	All the evidences points in favor of vaccination, just use your brain
1	All the feels for this! I was surprised that I got choked up seeing help on the way, this year has worn me down in ways I don‚Äôt even recognize yet. THANK YOU Pfizer-BioNTech, UPS, and FedEx for getting the vaccine distributed. Makes me proud to see it ship out of GR!
1/1	All the medicine has a risk of having allergy reactions. So why don‚Äôt you not give your kid medicine either.
0/0	All the negative commenters, you're commenting on a short trailer, watch the whole movie. There is more than enough proof. I grew up in Africa, we only got polio and German measles vaccinations. Most of us got measles, mumps, chicken pox, glandular fever etc We were away from school for a week, I never heard of any child dying. Now it's a vaccination for everything, even for the flu!!! It's a money making racket.

0/0	All the people lining up to recieve shots: 25,000 people tested said shot: long term effects unknown: 5 years later, everyone who recieved shot, grows ears and a tail.
1/1	All the results we have seen are mostly positive with Covid vaccine... fine if you cannot have it because of underlying health probs... but if not... everyone should comply
1/1	All the shit people put in their bodies, but you're concerned about vaccines? Do you have any idea what is in the air you inhale into your lungs? This has nothing to do with unknowns and potential dangers. You are all fucking liars. This is childish defiance. Nothing more.
1/1	All the vaccines are safe and incredibly protective against severe COVID-19. They will keep you from getting really sick. They will keep you out of the hospital. They will save your life. They will help sustainably end transmission in the population.
1/1	All the vaccines being used have been produced by large and known pharmaceutical companies. It is our duty to be all vaccinated to stop Covid
1/0	All the vaccines that are developed so far, have been tested on people because covid 19 is a much more serious and deadly disease in older people, all the developers had ensured that older people and people with underlying diseases like hypertension, diabetics, and heart are safe and vaccine works efficiently
1/1	All the work that rich countries are doing now to develop vaccines will save lives in developing countries too. Without a vaccine, those countries are at even greater risk than wealthy ones, because it‚Äôs even harder for them to do physical distancing and shutdowns.
0/0	All the youtube fools telling me to "trust the science" when I urged caution in the use of vaccines on people that are not at risk of covid 19. God i love being right.

1/0	All these pissed off kyles and karens got multiple vaccinations as children and still crying
0/0/0	All these vaccines are in the experimental stages are future symptoms and harm may take years to come out. say no to vaccines that are in experimental stages
0/0	All they keep emphasizing is unvaccinated people are more likely to get covid. But why are fully vaccinated with boosters still catching it? I'm confused at this point.
0/0	All this bs and you still think this poison is safe???? Ya'll need to stop smoking whatever you're smoking.
0/-1	All this hit sound like a lie , when gods judgement come down it's gonna be hell on earth

1/1	All this population control conspiracy crap makes no sense. if the shots are that deadly, why would all the richest and most important people get it first?
1/1	All those data from hospitals are against unvaccinated people, but still noone seems to care.
1/0	All those infected experienced only a mild form of the disease, and NONE were hospitalized. So, get the covid vaccine. It may save your life.
1/1	All those people saying it must not be safe because it was done in such a short time, you got to stop and think maybe they had teams working round the clock, and that the vaccine was priority.
1/1/1	All those pundits and talking heads who wouldn't stop saying "it's going to take years at the current pace" just a few weeks ago are awfully quiet right now. Vaccines are the soloution to our problems and it has finally arrived.
0/0	All those vaccines made you autistic, as expected
1/1	All those who do not want to be vaccinated are ignorant and selfish people who do not care the least about their health and much less about the health of others.
1/1	All three vaccines are holding strong against COVID unlike not being vaccinated
0/0	All to scare people into taking the poison shots... The real vaxxed are now carriers of the real virus that spreads to the un-vaxxed.... Be aware, stay away from the vaxxed.....
0/0	All u have to do is just a little research, a tiny bit of research, and you‚Äôll run so far away from that vaccine !
0/0	All vaccinated is the one who got the virus please explain clearly WHO so people believe you clearly clearly clearly
1/1	All vaccinations should be mandatory. Jab or prison.
1/0	All vaccine science is designed to imitate and trigger natural immunity. The suggestion that natural immunity is inferior to a synthetic/genetic vaccine undermines all trust and faith in public health, and, in science itself.
0/0	All vaccines adverse reactions listed directly on the package insert is : DEATH
1	All vaccines and medications have side effects thats the truth but its still better to take them.
1/1	All vaccines are def not fake, as you sarcastically put it. They have literally saved lives from many diseases.
1/1	All vaccines are like that. That‚Äôs why we need everyone vaccinated. It‚Äôs 95% effective against getting sick at all though. The chicken pox vaccine is 60-100% effectiveness. When was the last time you heard of a kid getting chicken pox? Long time ago I bet.
0/0	All vaccines are poison, GMO, fetal tissue, animal gene. Be smart.
1/1	All vaccines are super safe.
1/1	All vaccines cause an auto immune response.
0/0	All vaccines don‚Äôt stop the spread of disease. All are dangerous. All made by the same companies
0/0	All vaccines in general are dangerous and ineffective. They have injured and killed people in the past.
1/1	All vaccines in the country are safe for use!!!
1/1	All vaccines show to be effective with the omicron in that when infected, your symptoms will be mild.
0/0	All vax is poison.
0/0	All western countries chose to be permanently childless‚Ä¶.
1	All you can do is research to the best of your ability. Talk to people who have had the vaccine, find out if they have had suffered side effects, and, if they have, how severe? Find out about COVID-19, how safe would it be if you had this disease? Would you likely survive? Would your grandparents or elderly neighbour survive if they became affected through your giving them the Corona virus? I had the first injection three weeks shot. Apart from a sore arm, I have had no ill effects. I am glad that I have had it, because I am now far less likely to die from Corona virus.
0/0	All you little pro vaxx people need to wake up and see that you're litteraly being brainwashed.
0/0	All you need to know is anything that gets rushed and not studied or tested properly is not safe.,
0/0/0/0/0	All you need to know is you can still get COVID after taking the shot and you‚Äôll die wearing your mask because they‚Äôre never going away. So enjoy bells palsy and an assortment of other side effects.
0/0	All you people who say you won't take it need to stick with it. I don't want to be one of the last hold outs when they start blocking people from entering stores without proof of vaccination. Or if my job makes it mandatory. It has to be all of us.
0/0	Allah will save me, don‚Äôt need no needles
0/0	Allergic reaction. How about just Fucking Poison
0/0	Allergic reaction? Ya mean side affects
0/0	Allergic reactions and face paralysis are some of the side effects so far. You would have to be out of your mind to take the vaccine.
0/0	Allow a maturing immune system to naturally strive. What's wrong with those demons.
0/0	Allow the natural immune system to fight and strive against the disease, instead of vaccine
1/1	Allowing misinformation about a life saving vaccine and causing ppl not to get vaccinated during a pandemic is harmful. Ppl are literally dying because of it. I know 10 ppl personally who have died in the last 2 months because they refused the vaccine
1/1	Almost 76% Americans with one shot now! We are getting so close to being done with this thing.
1/1	Almost all vaccines do not prevent 100% transmission or infection. The Covid vaccines are vastly safer than Covid itself.
1/1	Almost convinced me that perhaps COVID-19 could be used to get rid of some of the stupid ones! This is a pandemic boys and girls. It can kill a lot of people. The rules are intended to keep,you safe from it.
1/0	Almost every complication shows up within two weeks. So far, the mild side effects are the ones you want
1/1	Almost like it‚Äôs causing an immune response based on the antibodies your body has been making since the first dose.
0/0	Almost like they want us to just shut up and obey and take this new untested experimental vaccine for some reason they seem desperate that we all take it.
0/0	Almost looks like a conspiracy to make people infertile, like they are more worried about overpopulation than the actual virus.
1/1	Almost no one over the age of 65 is against vaccines, why? Because thees people saw friends and family crippled or die from times before vaccines.
1/1	Almost time to help our lovely Canadian pals! Also I got my first dose of Pfizer on Saturday and I‚Äôm HYPED
1/1	Almost weekly I read a story about 1 or both unvaccinated parents dying and leaving kids behind. Those kids are going to grow up, learn the truth, and say, "Our parents were idiots".
1/-1	Alot of money moved during this pandemic
0/0	Alot of the more serious side effects seem to be getting left out here ?????? Myocarditis, blood clots, death etc. At least be upfront about the risks..then you might gain more trust from people.
1	Already been a little over six hours since my first dose, and aside of the ungodly arm pain I‚Äôm experiencing right now, I‚Äôm feeling fine. #CovidVaccine
1/1	Already contracted the shitty thing during first wave so not in a big rush to get vaccinated. Not afraid of vaccines and will happily do it to help vulnerable people out there but I will wait my turn since I‚Äôm in my late 20s. Would love more info about possible adverse reactions (I have few allergies myself) and the likelihood of reinfections (suffered from IRDS as I was a premature child and I‚Äôm terrified I used up all my ‚Äúgood odds‚Äù with first infection - so I hope it happens only once) but I guess I can only wait for that.
1/1	Already did, and I highly recommend it. There is no risk, and there are no microchips involved
1	Already did. Most vaccines need boosters, this is nothing new.
1/1	Already got dose two. A sore arm and an afternoon nap were a price worth paying. If only someone had actually done something like this six months ago instead of trying to suppress testing and lying about the severity of the issue...
1/1	Already got it. I really dont care about the vaccine, it really is not that deep of a situation as the conspirators say it is. I just dont understand why people are against it so much.
1/1	Already got my first dose.
1/1	Already got my first shot. I can't wait for a normal summer.
1/1	Already got my flu vaccine and I can't wait to get the COVID vaccine
0/0	Already had and recovered from covid. I wont be taking any vaccine anytime soon. I'm going to need to see alot more long term effects results
0/0/0/0/0	Already had covid not taking a vaccine
1/1	Already have. And I feel great.
1/1	Already in some countries people who choose not to be vaccinated have to pay for the time they are on a ventilator in a hospital, that gets their attention
1/0	Alrhough I don't understand everything, at least I understand something! Ty, Jesus bless you Medcram
1/1	Alright Mary it's time to go to bed, yall don't want to take a vaccine that has passed multiple human trials, no hospitalizations, no deaths, and still are naive to it. If it makes you feel better Trump was one who started funding and made sure it was safe üòè So you're so-called "Micro Chip" theory can get put to rest
1/1	Also I hope you fall into one of the tiers approved for vaccination. Please dont jump the line.
1/1	Also I‚Äôm getting the second covid vaccine today
0/0	Also even myself, i had my own similar experience where my vaccinated friend got it and I was with him 12 hours before his symptoms showed. Maybe all their immune systems are shot?
0/-1	Also had someone we know die 3 days after the vaccine and he was only 36 healthy
1/1	Also if doctors were al a part of some conspiracy why would they all be getting it?
0/0	Also if you have a strong immune system there is no need for the vaccine
0/0	Also just want to say the side effects of this vaccine sound worse than covid-19 itself.
1/0	Also just want to say the side effects of this vaccine sound worse than covid-19 itself. You do realize it's still not as bad as the flu right?
1/1	Also mind blowing when ppl say they won't get the vaccine because they don't know the long term effects (which i agree to an extent) , but yet don't give a shit about the long term effects covid has. I rather get the vaccine than get covid.
0/0	Also the amish never take vaccines and therefore you will never find an autistic amish.
1/1	Also this morning, I've had my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine.
0/0	Also, I researched the vaccines attempts for sars and mers. Yes, there will be some post injection adverse reactions but it was the long term immune system issues that were the problem. Have not found anything yet that says they overcame those issues. So, the long term consequences are not known by the public but pretty sure the vaccine pushers know.
1/1	Also, brain clots aren't contagious, Covid is. I've got my 2nd AV Jab in a couple of weeks, and have exactly zero concerns.
0/0	Also, the vaccine will kill you before then. Good luck on killer Vax!
1/1	Also. If you are eligible, PLEASE get vaccinated!
0/0	Altering instructions with mRNA to respond to a virus is genetic manipulation and changes the DNA blueprint that you are born with.....no thanks, i'll stay me.
1/1	Alternative title: Kurzgesagt politely roasting anti-vaxs in a nutshell.
0/0	Although I am fully vaccinated, I would refuse a third vaccination due to the most severe side effects.
1/1	Although I am not from the UK and will likely not receive any doses for the coming weeks, this is incredibly good news!! I hope other health agencies also finds the vaccine to be safe.
1/1	Although I've already had Covid I still plan on taking a vaccine eventually. I've been nervous about the mRNA vaccine but feel so much reassure by this explanation.
1/1	Although the vaccine is rushed that doesnt mean it isnt safe for use. they aren't just skipping past the "testing phase", they are still taking many precautions to make sure its effects do more good than harm.
0/0	Aluminum......Antifreeze.......Acetone.......Mercury.......Formaldehyde......Fetal Tissue.......It's everything you've ever wanted in a Vaccine or Witches Potion.
1/1	Always get my flu and other vaccines. Will get the covid vaccine as soon as it is available to seniors in Orlando
0/-1	Always great to see the vast majority of comments are from the ones that never went near the vaccines, or won't take anymore of them. Gives me hope in humanity, and has always confirmed to me that the unvaxxed number are skewed for the agenda. I think they are saying 40 million unvaxxed in the US now. Amazing it was apparently 100 million only 2 months ago and they are pretending 60 million ran out and got injected since then.
1/1	Always prevention is better than treatment period.
0/0	Always staying safe...too afraid to have it
1/1	Always vaccinate!
0/-1	Am A Little Bit Confused?!?
1/1	Am I supposed to feel bad? He got what he wanted. The "freedom" to not take the Jab. I guess someone should've told him "freedom isnt free".
0/0	Am I the only one concerned about the possible long term carcinogenic effects of an mRNA vaccine?
1/1	Am Pfizer fully vaccinated.. Tnx biontech :)
0/0	Am not a skeptic, am not hesitant, not an anti vaxxer either. Am an intelligent free thinking, free breathing adult who has researched the dangers of an experimental dangerous UNNECESSARY drug and decided I dont want to die.
0/0	Am not getting vaccine. Am healthy and drink more alcohol than water I'll be fine
0/0	Am not taking vaccine neither any of my kids taking that shit that's my law
1/1	Am seeing cases now of vaccinated patients not catching covid at all when exposed at home - or much milder illness, Dramatic local outbreak in local care home where those vaccinated were spared.This is 1st hand / coal face experience
0/0	Am very sceptical about this deadly vaccine.
1/1	Amazing explanation of these vaccines and how they work. Thank you so much for this video, you're an excellent teacher!
1	Amazing how being around more vaccinated people made kids less likely to get infected. Seems like basic common sense to me but here we are.
0/0	Amazing how people like this woman are still believing the medical establishment after everything they‚Äôve been through
1/1	Amazing information in such dark times!! Got mine two weeks ago no side effects
1/1	Amazing news, get every one injected ASAP, let's get on top of this virus and get back to some kind of normality.
1/1	Amazing that people can work in a medical environment and be opposed to vaccines. How did these idiots ever get through school or get employed in the first place?
1/0/1	Amazing that we're getting to the point of dictating instructions to the cells
1/1	Amazing they have a vaccine already !
0/1	Amazing vaccine
1/-1	Amazing video bro, taught me so much and presented in a nice logical order with visuals. This is what they need to keep replaying on mainstream media for the rest of the idiiots.
1/1/1/1	Amazing what humans can do when we come together and throw a bunch of money at a common goal. This is why science funding is necessary.
1/1	Amazing! Can't wait to get the lil ones vaccinated!
1/-1	Amazing! Thank you for doing this!
0/0	Amazing, isn‚Äôt it? In order to avoid an illness with few or mild symptoms, you get a severe reaction, instead, to a vaccine which doesn‚Äôt actually protect you from the illness with few or mild symptoms that you‚Äôre trying to avoid.
1/1	Amen Preach Bishop Covid 19 is being spread through the unvaccinated. Why people can‚Äôt see that? They are letting Satan blind them from truth.
0/0	Amen, sister!!! I'm not getting the shot, I'm healthy & feeling fine!! Tomorrow's my 73rd birthday üòäüòä
1/1	Amen. The risks of not getting vaccinated outweigh the risks of COVID. Period.
1/1	America has done an incredible job with the vaccines after that hiccup at the beginning
1/-1	America is great because the willfully ignorant can lawfully assemble to demonstrate that they have the freedom to be a grave hazard to public health.
0/-1/-1	America wouldn‚Äôt need a vaccine so quickly if people grew up and did what they were supposed to do during the pandemic
1/1/0/1/0/-1/-1	America wouldn‚Äôt need a vaccine so quickly if people grew up and did what they were supposed to do during the pandemic...
1/1/1/1	American here. Just received my J&J vaccine a few hours ago. So far, so good!
1/1	Americans aged 50 to 64 who are unvaccinated are 46 times more likely to end up in the hospital with Covid-19 than those who are vaccinated and boosted.
1/1	Americans are dying of COVID at the rate of over 1,100 a day, and 98% of them are unvaxxed. This is the finding of the states of Texas, Georgia and Arizona, among others.
1/1	Americans don't know how fortunate they are to actually have the COVID vaccine so available right now. For most Latin American countries, we don't have a choice to make, it is simply not available. I'd love to get my mom and dad vaccinated so I can stop feeling so scared and anxious every single day. It baffles me that you guys are so privileged and don't even realize it sometimes.
0/0	Americans don't trust the msm for regular information. How can we trust them with our lives??
1/1	Americans have been eating themselves to death for decades but they don't seem to worry about that.
0/1	Americans have some serious trust issues! Doubting the medical field and the doctors. They think they know better than any expert.
1	Americans need to believe in science and actually comprehend it.
0/0	Americans should also have the freedom to decline the vaccine
1/0	Americans: Show us the government officials taking the vaccine and we will see if they mutate into zombies or not. Americans when government officials take the vaccine on live national television: Look at how they blocked the view, its obviously water!
1/-1	Americas Frontline Doctors is the only place you should get your news regarding this nonsense
0/0	Amount of data on the long-term side effects - zero. Let that sink in.
1/1	An American doctor has said that oral contraceptives are much more likely to cause blood clots than the AZ vaccine.
0/-1	An FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research advisory panel discussion declared that the risk of myocarditis was higher than COVID-19 in males under the age of 40.
0/1	An INSANE amount of young healthy athletes suddenly start dropping dead of heart attacks shortly after taking a shot known to cause heart problems. But it's totally unrelated guys.
0/0	An NHS nurse who has contracted Covid-19 three weeks after being vaccinated says she is "angry and heartbroken"
1/1	An anti vaxer getting autism would be an improvement.
1/1	An anti-masker type is the last person I expect to be telling the truth. Selfish people tell self-serving ‚Äòtruths.‚Äò
1/0	An antivax paediatrician? Sounds like an anti-firewall network admin.
0/0	An autoimmune reaction to the vaccine, and you wonder why more and more people are sick with autoimmune diseases.
1/1	An effective vaccine will protect a person who receives it by lowering their chances of getting COVID-19 if they encounter the coronavirus.
0/0	An experimental emergency use vaccine for a virus so deadly you have to be tested to even know you're sick.
0/0	An experimental emergency use vaccine... never before tested on humans.... for a virus so deadly you have to be tested to even know you have it...and they are lining up for it ü§£üíâ
0/0	An inhumane practice being done worldwide.
0/0	An risk of blood clotting isn't safe. There have been so many reports of adverse reactions.
1/1	An unsurprising headline: "State trooper who told governor to "kiss my ass" over vaccine order dies of COVID." He leaves behind his wife and four kids. But you know, the far right loved him, so I'm sure it was worth it.
0/0	An untested shot that wont keep you from getting the virus or keep you from spreading it?... so what is it?
1/1	An unvaccinated medical professional is like having a preacher who hasn't been baptized. Wake up people!
1/1	An unvaccinated person is 68 times more likely than a vaccinated person to die and an unvaccinated person Is 16 times more likely to be hospitalised than a vaccinated person. I think that‚Äôs telling us that the vaccine stops even more deaths than it stops hospitalisations in vaccinated people than in unvaccinated people.
0/0	And HUGELY increase risk of death or serious injection injury
1/-1	And I am NOT the only one reporting these side effects! It‚Äôs an immune response.
1/1	And I am so grateful. My parents are both alive because of testing and vaccines.
0/0	And I am still not taking it
1/1	And I had my concerns but after watching this video I feel safe to go for it.
0/0	And I still ain't avin the vaccine
0/0	And I thought the experts said the rushed to market vaccine was safe. This story is being covered by all news agencies before some keyboard warrior accuses me of being biased and not carrying out any further research.
1/1	And Im sitting here in good old Germany where they fucked everything up and people are going to be waiting month to get a vaccine. I did some research on a site and it suggested that if we continue to vaccine people this fast, then I'll be able to get one in November 2023. smfh.
0/0	And I‚Äôll still pass on the pop control shots
1/0	And I‚Äôm still for the life of me am trying to figure out why , if you‚Äôre protected (vaccinated), why would you have a problem with me risking my own self health??
0	And Now Anthony FAUCI announced that US will test vaccins onto all ages groups, down till 12yo this year, and ending with age : 6month to 2 years old at the beginning of 2022... WTF !!?
1/-1	And THIS is why I love science and technology...
0/-1	And almost all cases are fully vaccinated.
1/1	And also allowing the virus a better environment to mutate and make the vaccine less effective in the long run, ensuring that covid will be around for a long time instead of eliminating it when we had the chance.
0/0	And can you say how many people has this vaccinacion has killed...and it has...no thank you i will not be injected‚Ä¶
1/1	And enough. Am getting the jab now.
0/1	And even merrier, China wouldn't be slow at mass manufacturing it for the world. Great news!
1/1	And every single day, the number of Americans who will die will increase unless you #WearAMask and #Vaccinate
0/0	And getting that vaccine after living that long was the stupidest thing she could have ever done!
0/0	And hardly a word on taking care of yourself through a healthy lifestyle and not compromising your immune system. Its easier to believe that taking a vaccine that has never been used on humans and produced in the shortest time ever. So many questions answered with trust us. A vaccine that experts cannot tell us the duration of effectiveness, whether or not it will prevent you from transmitting, whether or not it will protect you from the mutations and of course long term adverse effects. I am not criticizing those that take it and will not tolerate criticism for not taking it.
0/0	And here goes down their fertility rate
1/1	And here is to hoping that they have enough common sense to get the vaccine regardless
1/1	And here we are at the end of the year with a vaccine that just got shipped to my state. Fantastic job!
0/0/0	And here we go! The VACCINATED are more likely to get the SA virus!
1/0	And how haven't we managed to get a 90 odd percent positive result with things like malaria etc? Is it because they don't affect us western whites as much? Seems weird that they have managed to create a vaccine that is so affective in such a short space of time to me??
1/1	And how many masked up people got sick and/or died from rona? Millions!!!! We are screwed either way but I am taking my chances with vax. I drive car, take hormone therapy, and work at high risk job. Life is full of risks. Won‚Äôt even go into my sucky ass genetica!
0/0	And if it's mandated? I still won't do the jab. I'll gladly go to prison for non compliance.
0/0	And if you have any allergies that you don‚Äôt know about don‚Äôt come !!!!!!
1/1	And it is not true that vaccines give your children autism and I would personally have a child with autism then a dead kid
0/0	And it isn't just these v4ccines! Those long-term health issues are caused by most vaccines in some people. People with the wrong genetics, I suppose. I'm actually all for depopulation by sterilization. The poor and stupid human is a serious issue and there are too many of us. However, these long-term health issues are what I have a problem with. Another thing is that they're passed on through our descendants. NOT GOOD FOR HUMAN EVOLUTION.
0/0	And it's up to people whether they want the jab or not. We all have freedom of choice!
0/0	And it‚Äôs finally happened. Broken heart Someone I‚Äôve worked with for almost 10 years passed away two nights ago , one week after his 1st Syringe.
0/0	And just like that the vax doesnt work.
0/0	And mannequins wearing them but what‚Äôs dangerous is the vaccine
0/0	And millions still don't, because people are waking up on this deadly vaccine.
0/0	And my natural element immunity is 13 times better than the vaccine so I'll pass.
0/0	And nobody should force me or anyone to take it
0/0	And not to mention all the big companies rolling out these untested vaccines like Pfizer have been sued to death and paid up huge fines for illegal marketing, improper labeling of medications, foreign corrupt practices, bribery, government contract related offenses and drug/medical equipment safety violations. But you can trust them.
1/1	And now there are three! This news just keeps getting better and better!
0/0	And now who is lining up to play guinea pigs
1/1	And of course the drooling, one toothed goobers will still refuse the vaccine. Love how those rabid righties always call themselves "patriots" or "Freedom Fighters." In reality everything is all about them, no social responsibility.
1/-1	And others out there would rather listen to social media and they‚Äôre own personal beliefs which will doom them and others around them
1/-1	And people complain about us Americans being uneducated, stubborn halfwits. The absolute gaul
0/0	And people die almost immediately, get very sick for weeks, oh and they do it on tv. For somthing no worse then the flu
1/-1	And people still believe the virus is fake...smh
0/0	And please do tell me how the vaccine works... because it sure as hell isn‚Äôt working what so ever. Prevents severe disease?
1/1	And shout out to all the anti-vaxx: ‚ÄòBelieve what you want but please don‚Äôt force others into your way of life. There has already been enough pain this year. We don‚Äôt want another year of misery because people refuse to take vaccines.‚Äô
1/0	And so I expect that by this autumn we'll have lots of 'trial by fire' situations with vaccines in the world.
1/1	And stay home. And get the vaccine.
1/1	And suddenly the anti-Vaxxers become YouTube educated experts again
1/1	And that is wonderful for you, however, the well over half a million who are DEAD can't tell you that is wasn't that bad! And why would the person who was the so called president tell millions not to get the vaccine, however, he made sure that his family was totally vaccinated.
0/0	And that‚Äôs exactly why I would NEVER wear a mask or vaccinate! I win
0/0	And that‚Äôs how the beginning of I am legend started
0/0	And the animals in the mrna trials were "fine" right after, yet when exposed to illness their body had an auto immune reaction that killed them.
1/1	And the anti vaccine crowd still promote their nonsense. Should be rounded up and forcibly vaccinated
1/0	And the fear propaganda gets more deceptive and brazen. We still refuse to comply.
0/0	And the masses will receive this via mandated covid-19 vaccine.. good luck mandating me to take that...
0/-1	And the propaganda continues. Their day is coming when they will reap what they sow and it won't be pretty.
0/0	And the r / Canada thread is proclaiming how great the vaccine is working. fuckin lol
1	And the vaccine is the only thing today that can stop the pandemic
0/0	And the vax works! Spreads from one vaxed person to the next! Thus, needing another booster, in order to get it again and need another booster...
0/0	And then they will tell us that this vaccination campaign is not a scandal! Is it true that Pfizer has a disclaimer in case of side effects after vaccination? - Lib√©ration
0/0	And these are NOT EVEN the LONG TERM SIDE EFFECTS !!!!!
0/0	And they call us crazy for passing on this experimental drug!
0/0	And they can shove that Vaccine into the pile of the rest I won't get
0/-1	And they honestly expect people who aren't even worried about Covid to get a vaccine like that???
0/0	And they say it were not lab created.....hm....I think it was! They are actually telling you how they created it without you understanding that they did create the virus!
0/0	And this is why I NEVER take the needle...and this is what the corrupt mainstream reports; can't imagine what they're not going to report.
0/0	And this vaccine alters your DNA and immune system and every child you ever make, if you will even be able to have kids after this. In the very small safety trials, 70% became infertile, and vaccinated males caused unvaccinated females to become infertile through their vaccine-altered sperm. By the way, the Pfizer vaccine has AIDS proteins in it and caused at least 60 people in Australia to become HIV positive, which they called ‚Äúfalse positives.‚Äù If someone injects you with part of the DNA protein strands of AIDS and you wind up HIV positive, then you‚Äôre HIV positive.
0/0/0/0/0/0	And those that die months or years after taking the vaccine will never be linked to the vaccine
0/0	And today the cdc posted this study:https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7104e1.htm#T2_down of hundreds of patients from New york and California which demonstrates that starting in June 2021 natural immunity provided greater protection than vaccines. Look at the science, folks, if you have the balls. Or stick to your prejudices and read the WA post: the post doesn‚Äôt report on the latest CDC research. Any half-assed reporter could go to a protest, interview a hundred people, and present the stupidest people from that large group as examplars of a perspective they are already prejudiced against to foment more prejudice and hatred. And you can read it and hate and call names and think about how smart you are and how stupid everyone you disagree with is, and ignore the science the cdc has just published.
0/0	And vaccines affect female fertility. Goes hand in hand.

1/1	And we have selfish people here in the US that refuse to be vaccinated.
0/0	And what about the countless severe adverse effects that thousands of people, including me, are suffering from since they got their shot(s)? One shot of this experimental "vaccine" changed my life to a nightmare. Just as well as so many other's.
0/0	And what are you going to do about the deaths its causing; i.e. Dr. in Florida died after getting the vaccine or the face paralysis or the other side effects that is happening?
1/1	And what do we do with this information now? Even if an infection protects better than a vaccination, I still prefer the vaccination. Anything else would mean that I would voluntarily become infected, and that would seem pretty stupid to me.
0/0	And what if you didn't inject yourself with crap, and left your immune system alone
0/0	And what is stopping your immune system attacking itself when it realizes there is a foreign entity in its cells?.
0/0	And what other info these mRna include ??!!!
1/1	And when you are lying in intensive care moments from death and the last words you ever hear are from your loved ones saying "If only he had the vaccine"
0	And who‚Äôs going to be held accountable for this? NO ONE!
1/0	And within these populations they will pass Covid back and forth and takes us to ever more mutated viruses. The government will have to take serious steps both coercive and rewarding in the name of public health to encourage vaccination.
0/0	And yes, I'm an anti-vaxxer. I won't get that damn vaccine.
1/0	And yet it's not a real vaccine cause it does not prevent them from contracting or spreading covid? Wake up America,
1/1	And yet my friend has been in the hospital for the last month because he did not get the vaccine. His wife did not believe in vaccines.
1/1	And yet my mother is still convinced the vaccines are actively killing otherwise completely healthy people. I can‚Äôt fucking wait to get vaccinated and rub it in her face
0/0	And yet people are dying who have taken the vaccines
0/0	And yet, people with both shots and the booster are still getting it.
0/0	And you didn't even mention potential long term damage to human cells get lost with your experiment
0/0	And you won't see this article on any other news site, that's for sure. I'm sure there is already in place a media black out reporting severe side effects or death from the vaccine. The problem is, you don't how it will effect you till it's too late. I'll take my chances with the virus.

1/1	Another great result on COVID vaccine! AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine resulted in 67% reduction in positive swabs (i.e., infection) among those vaccinated. Vaccine will reduce transmission. Data also support 12 week prime-boost dosing interval.
1/1	Another great result on COVID vaccine! AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine resulted in 70% reduction in positive swabs (i.e., infection) among those vaccinated. Vaccine will reduce transmission. Data also support 12 week prime-boost dosing interval.
1/1	Another great vaccine to add to our collection, thank you to the scientist who have helped make this, those who volunteered to prove there safety much faster than normal due to lack of people, can't wait for my 2nd jab
0/0	Another lie from the WHO supposedly there to protect people? #EnoughIsEnough #covidnonsense to make people use chemical alternatives and prevent healthy people! We know better!
1/1	Another massively important finding is that in this huge trial, not a single person was hospitalized with Covid >22 days after single dose vaccination. Not one. That changes everything. Well done to scientists & government for choosing the strategy in the face of fierce criticism
0/0	Another mutation,another varriant,same vaccine
1/1	Another non-headline to grab attention .. a 'small study' ... why can't the media wait until the real people .. the scientists and the doctors ... have carried out extensive research to find out the exact facts. That of course wouldn't make a 'worrying, headline.
0/1	Another person died yesterday after the second dose...... #NoVaccineForMe
0/0	Another person dies after taking the Coronavirus vaccine. #NoVaccine4me
1/-1	Another pointless study showing what teenagers can work out, the vaccine helps with hospitalisations but vaccines are not made to reduce hospitalisations they are made to reduce infections which inevitably reduces hospitalisations and deaths it‚Äôs really common sense
1/-1	Another reason for the vaccine is not to spread the virus.
1/1	Another reason to be mad at antivaxxers is because they can spread disease. Some people don‚Äôt have health insurance or could afford certain vaccines, meanwhile these people who do have health insurance and are privileged enough to afford it choose not to.
1/1	Another stupid anti-vaccine moron trumper
1	Another video where people are completely skipping over the convulsions. Still, the vaccine is statistically worth taking for those over 65.
1/1	Another week, another school notification, another child tested positive for COVID in the classroom. We have lost 348 lives to #COVID & had 270K infections in #TX21 for the month of January. Do your part: get vaccinated (boosted), wear a mask, avoid crowds, & wash hands often.
1/1	Another well informed broadcast that helps to keep moral high and provides good understanding to us lay-people, thank you for your perseverance.
1/-1	Another well thought out video....I hope the information reaches people on the fence due to a lack of understanding regarding these talking points.

0/1	Anti vaxxers were once all for vaccines until they witnessed a decline in their child's health following a vaccine. In the scientific literature, its well documented that vaccines can induce an over reaction in the immune system commonly known as a cytokine storm. Yet, when this happens and it leads to death or autoimmune diseases, almost everyone has been programmed to say, "it couldn't be the vaccines"
1/-1	Anti vaxxers will be triggered.

Natural Immunity is the best protection, and all medical studies show it, the Harvard Medical Study, the Neuro-Immunology Study by Innsbruck University, the CDC Study, and the latest Study from Italy itself, in Umbria, which shows lasting effective NI at 18 months. Meanwhile, the Adverse Effects and evidence of Immuno-compromise caused by the Jabs continues to grow. These countries are ignoring Science and the Nuremburg Code, and they are doing it for cynical purposes, to print Pandemic Bonds to increase their Budgets. Absolutely disgusting.

1/1	Anti-Vaxxers are crazy. Serious side effects from vaccines are rare. Even vaccines that effects you higher than the average will be protecting a person from that disease.
1/1	Anti-Vaxxers are cruel heartless & Divisive, bcuz they only Care about self and No one else but themselves, So selfish & sad

0/0	Anti-vaxxers are not an extreme movement. My grandmother was an anti vaxxer. She was born in 1910 and never got sick. She never had memory issues, teeth issues, or issues living alone. She died of natural causes at 90. Mychildren will never be vaccinated. They have no allergies, they rarely get sick, and have no neurological issues. My father and aunt have had the measles, mumps, and lived in a farm community with no tetanus shots. Neither of them have never heard of a single death or complication from measles or mumps.
1/1	Anti-vaxxers are nothing else but idiots IMHO.

1/1	Anti-vaxxers better back off when one finally comes out
1/1	Anti-vaxxers call Covid vaccines "experimental" Well -the experiment is to see if very safe vaccines with proven efficacy can reduce the burden of disease, save lives and get us out of lockdown. That's something me and over 300 million others are delighted to be a part of!
1/1	Anti-vaxxers complain about COVID being a biological weapon from China, yet refuses to take precaution of protecting themselves from that same "weapon".

1/1	Anti-vaxxers make me so irrationally angry, because they‚Äôre the type of people who just... reject science. We can have differing opinions all day long, but only when they‚Äôre legitimate opinions based in a world of facts. You can‚Äôt just deny science. It‚Äôs fucking science.
1/1	Anti-vaxxers need to be left behind. Don't want to take one for the team? Then you can't be part of the team. Can't work. Can't fly. Can't eat at restaurants. No concerts, no bars, no dice. People who want to advance society don't have to cater to those who drag us down.

1/-1	Anti-vaxxers should be denied health care when they get sick.
1/1	Anti-vaxxers should be excluded from society. They should not be allowed to enter stores, schools, theaters, bars, restaurants or any other place where large groups gather. They are biohazards and should be treated like biohazards.

1/1	Anti-vaxxing is all about taking unsubstantiated misinformation as fact
0/-1	Antibodies and other components of the immune system remember invaders, helping protect against further infection.
0/0	Antibody dependent enhancement ADE was caused by the SARS Cov 1 vaccine years ago during testing and it was never approved. This also happened with the Dengue vaccine. as it does with many RNA viruses. There were no long term safety trials to determine if this will happen with this vaccine. so count me out. I'm not taking this vaccine and becoming a part of the largest vaccine trial in history.
0/0	Antigenic shift (mutation) is a common normal biological function among coronavirus /more so with flu. This is precisely why vaccines have little to no chance of effectiveness for Corona type viruses. History has proven this true over and over. Corna vaccines are notoriously problematic ( mostly due to rapid weakening) and have never been successful.

1/1	Antivax nonsense. No safety steps are being skipped over. Different trial stages are being run concurrently, rather than after the previous stage. They're being performed in different populations concurrently across the globe, rather than after eachother. Your skepticism is simply ignorance.
1/1	Antivax people great job on single handedly dooming us all. I wish we could send you all to mars where you belong as you clearly lack the common sense the rest of us have
1/1	Antivax's arguments are the same. Just because the paper was debunked doesn't mean that the fire wont leap to another bunch of fuel. These people still say that the some of the vaccines still have mercury and that is causing the autism. It doesn't matter that it's not true, and that there's valid research that shows this. It really is simply arguing from ignorance.

0/0	Any chance the cell-manufactured spike protein, on exiting the cell membrane, could then instead turn around and plug into the very same cell receptors on the outside of the cell membrane that the whole virus would normally use? Where I'm going with this, is if the answer is 'yes', then what would happen if a cell was then swamped with spikes stuck on it's outside - i.e: would it then look like 'non-self' to our immune system, and come under attack(!), effectively causing some kind of auto-immune disease ? . . . also, you didn't address the allergic deleterious issue with the novel lipid nanoparticle, causing issues in some people . . .
1/1	Any coronavirus vaccine that is approved must go through all the clinical trials and safety checks all other licensed medicines go through. The MHRA follows international standards of safety.

1/1	Anybody ever heard of omicron before we heard omicron? Nobody said the vax would stop the spread of covid, but it slows it down and reduces hospitalization and deaths. Israel is now using a 4th dose to try to stop their daily average death toll going from 0 in December to 38 now

1/1	Anyone not getting vaccinated is obeying the propaganda of the white supremacists, the patriots, etc....Get vaccinated!
1/1	Anyone not wanting to take a vaccination, you're on your own
0/0	Anyone saying they're anxious to get it especially online, is working for big pharma or trolling for government. The government can't fully control you if they don't get you hooked on these jabs. Ask yourself if you made it through 2020 till now and the stats are showing the Rona is leveling out why are you getting it for a thing in which is still mutating? Do you notice how there is no mention by government of taking care of yourself by eating right, and taking vitamins
1/1	Anyone still refusing is definitely someone the military will be better off without. Good news
0/0	Anyone taking a vaccine for a disease that has a 99%+ recovery rate needs their head examined
0/0	Anyone taking any vaccine created in less than a year, not tested on animals, not tested for future birth defects, must be crazy.
1/1	Anyone that choses not to be vaccinated should be on a wait list for hospitalization.
0/0	Anyone that forces you to do anything without your consent is a Criminal. Why isn't it criminal to force the vaccine?

0/0/0	Anyone trying to give me a shot is going to have the worst day ever of their life.
1/1	Anyone using any type of modern medicin shouldnt be to worried about a simple vaccine. Read the disclosier of adhd medicin for example and and see the risks that affect 1 in 10.000. Not 1 in 1.000.000 Ow and one of the risks u have from using ritalin for example, is death and infection in arteries in ur brain.. not just "simple" blood clot. Chill guys its a simple vaccine..

1/1	Anyone who doesn't get the vaccine is a threat to our democracy.
1/1	Anyone who has not yet understood that the pandemic is a problem for society as a whole and that the individual is (inevitably) a part of society will now learn it in a different way.
1/1	Anyone who is an active anti-vaxxer and who actively works to sabotage the vaccination campaign and keeps the country in a health crisis, if they catch Covid, as a punishment, they should be isolated and be left to die.

0/0	Anyone who wants to speed up their time up here on earth take the shot
0/0	Anyone who willingly goes out there and allows such poison in their body is absolutely crazy!
0/0	Anyone who would trust the government is retarded and foolish. Conspiracy is the way the world is run why is it so hard to believe. People don‚Äôt know their history sadly. Tats why we all act so much like sheep !
0/0	Anyone with an ounce of common sense wouldn't want to be used as a guinea pig for a vaccine that was produced in such a short period of time.
0/0	Anyone with any sense has at least some hesitation. We're talking about a drug that was rushed through, and treats a disease with a 99% susrvival rate
1/1	Anyone without a brain says that you shouldnt get vaccinate. They are lying

0/-1	Anytime someone has to "bribe" you into doing anything, you automatically know that something is wrong
0/0	Anyway when me and my partner (also unvaxxed) turned up to the gathering we made everyone's jaws drop. We basically looked a decade younger than everyone else there. Well as you can imagine us being sexy-as-fuck sure made it hard for any of my nosy vaxxed friends to give us any 'hEaLtH aDvIcE'.

0/-1	Apparently its not effective if you are French and aged above 65 or below 55 but works on everyone else very well.
1/0	Apparently one dose of both the Pfizer and Moderna ones are enough and that they should have marketed as one dose vaccines but can't now as the trials were based on 2 doses. It's a pity because it would speed things up.

1/1	Appreciated very helpful
1/1	Approaching 700k US deaths from covid, more than the Civil War. So many fools risking a covid infection when there's already proven vaccines widely available that can train their body to fight covid without risking a real covid infection. Also amazing the amount of home "researchers" cherry picking anything they can just to avoid getting vaccinated.
0/-1	Approval doesn‚Äôt mean much when it comes to the covid vaccine or boosters.
1/1	Approximately 75% of Americans would agree to be vaccinated against COVID-19 if they received assurances about the safety of the vaccine
1/1	Aprove this already! I'm in this trial and 99.99% positive I got the placebo, but I'm slated to get the real deal once this goes green.
1/1	Are flu shots free for everyone or just select groups? I agree though, vaccination for most things should be a free public provided service
0/-1	Are medical freedom warriors being set up to be public enemy #1 after a future low uptake of the vax. Sting pullers can easily prolong this plandemic in order achieve more global reset objectives.
0/0	Are other illness more dangerous than this "Covid".......and until now we live with them and doesn't need to make Vaccin .......are pills for this SARS Cov .....

1/1	Are vaccines good? Yes, beyond yes. Should everyone use vaccines? Yes.
1/1	Are vaccines safe? #Vaccines are now safer than ever before as they go through rigorous testing and development, subject to strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness.
0/0	Are we going to talk about the side effects of the vaccines, what other diseases (not viruses) it might cause?
0/0	Are we ignoring the fact, these vaccines have aborted baby cells? I am really confused.
0/0	Are we really trusting a company that knew and still sold baby powder proven to cause cancer?
0/0	Are you SURE you want a covid vaccine? Because once you get it, there‚Äôs no taking it out of you and you will be permanently stuck with the adverse side effects
0/0	Are you blind?! The pandemic is a hoax! They use lockdowns and vaccines to control us!!!
1/0	Are you going to get a vaccine for covid or are you still going to risk your life
0/-1	Are you guys going to make the rdif chip video too?
0/0	Are you nuts everyone takes the risks for everyone else and gets the vaccine? Everyone in my family who had Covid-19 didn't get sick with it. But we should take the risk and possibly get an adverse reaction to a vaccine. Anyone coming dictating to me or trying to stab me with a jab will be getting stabbed in the head.
0	Are you okay? NO! cause you will be dead after taking the vaccine!

1/1	Are you talking about me laughing on the other side of my face? I had my vaccination and I feel fabulous.
0/1	Are you tired of new mask requirements or other restrictions? Are your vaccinated friends blaming you for the need for them to get a thirdshot? You can do something about it! Abstain from conspiracy theories, block misinformation, listen to the experts, and get your vaccine!
1/1	Are you vaccinated? Prevention is better than cure. The greatest precaution you can take is to safeguard yourself by getting vaccinated. Get vaccinated and Be Safe.
1/1	Arguing with an anti vaxxer is like playing chess with a pigeon. You may win the game but the pigeon will knock all the pieces off, poop on the chess board, and strut around like it won anyway.
1/1	Around 20,000,000 people who have been vaccinated, those suffering thrombosis or blood clotting have been fewer than in the general public, who have not taken the vaccine. The vaccine is safe.

0/0	Arrhythmias, blood clots, seizures and the list keeps growing ...

1/1	As I already contracted COVID probably not right away as I'm already immune, but if it's mandatory for travelling Imma inject that shit ASAP.
0/-1	As I said in my book, we don't have a COVID-19 vaccine and may never. We have experimental biological agents using new mRNA technology that result in pathogenic priming & fertility issues and that do not stop transmission. Big Pharma immune from liability.
0/0	As I suspected...a vaccine was developed " too quickly " a rush to cure results in deaths...
1/-1	As I understand it, every state should be "all adults" by april 19 or sooner. My state will be all adults by the 16th , and I conveniently arrive on the 17th, so it should go fairly smoothly depending on appointment availability. I'm hoping I can get the J&J.
1/-1	As I‚Äôve been told by the anti-maskers all year, if you don‚Äôt want to get vaccinated, stay home.
0/0	As I‚Äôve said from the beginning, the vaccinated are the problem. Older people should get vaccinated, obese people should, but that‚Äôs it. All this fear porn has millions of Karens coming out hatefully against anyone without shot
0/0	As Peter Hitchens quite rightly remarked: 'Face masks turn us into voiceless submissives - and it‚Äôs not science forcing us to wear them, it‚Äôs politics.'
1/-1	As a (primarily) dem, I am also pro vax and anti vax mandate. At some point, we all need to realize that the picture the media paints of each political party is always the extreme and exaggerated side. I find that most of us are closer in our beliefs than is typically portrayed.
1/1	As a 13 year old who recently got my booster a few days ago and my 2 shot in may of 2021 and can confirm that the vaccine had ultimately no side effects on me. And I would strongly suggest getting it.
0/0	As a 16 year old I didn't want the vaccine but I was pressured by my friends and parents to have it. I've had one dose and I feel so terrible and sick, I might not even be able to go into school tomorrow because of it.
1/1	As a 29 year old service Plumber that that got the vaccine the first week it was available to those my age I have 3 words to say to that;
0/0	As a African my ancestors never needed man made medecine. Nature made herbs only I dont eat man made food, I'm vegan.
1/1	As a Brit our vaccination procurement and delivery is probably the single competent thing that the government has managed during the pandemic.
1/1	As a Canadian - your response and action on getting vaccines out to the population is impressive! Everyone being within 5 miles of where to get a shot - awesome!
1/1	As a Londoner who‚Äôs been double-vaxxed & single-boosted, I‚Äôm furious & flabbergasted by this extraordinary #CovidVaccine intel. What‚Äôs the matter with people? 1/3 thrid of peopl not vaccinted in london.
0/0	As a Nurse and giving this covid19 vaccine to community for months,I do respect the ‚ÄúRIGHTS‚Äù of each individual.But recently I was mandated to get the vaccine myself when I don‚Äôt want to and that may cost losing my job serving others which is sad.
1/1	As a PA resident and only 32 years old I scheduled my first appointment while at my doctors today. My health care provider has opened up appointments to everyone.
1/1	As a Texan myself, I'd like to state my apparently very controversial opinion that I'd rather have slight government intervention than a disease that could've been wiped out decades ago.
1/1	As a Type 1 diabetic who spends 40-plus hours a week at @Cronkite_ASU, I was thrilled to receive my 2nd dose of the COVID-19 vaccine early this morning. But I'm most grateful for the students I'm around every day who has been responsible, thoughtful and diligent to keep us safe.
1/1	As a biologist,I have to say this is a fantastic vaccine
0/0	As a black man in America, I'm gonna go ahead and opt out of the Tuskagee group and wait a bit before I commit to something like this.
1/1	As a doctor myself, I have had an extreme reaction to a vaccine (anaphylaxis). But I have also have seen children with diseases that could have been prevented with a vaccine. Because of that, I make sure I do my due diligence, but my children are 100% vaccinated. Also because I have seen children with preventable diseases I will always make sure my patients have all information at their disposal before they make their choice.
0/0	As a doctor, I totally agree with your statement. I also have not taken the vaccine on this account, and my nurse who had prior covid infection had very severe side effects to the first dose of vaccine and we had to advise her against the 2nd dose.
0	As a former research chemist... scientists are usually funded/endorsed by large pharmaceutical companies. Whichever pays the highest is the propaganda they push. That's why I quit the industry
1/1	As a fully vaccinated RN, I am quite fed up with the misinformation! Thanks for clarifying for the masses!
1/1	As a funeral director, I just want to extend my thanks to the anti-vaxxers, you lot are really supporting the industry during these difficult times.
1/1	As a guy with autism, I am deeply offended. Bottom line is if you don‚Äôt vaccinate your kid they might die before their 5th birthday.
1/1	As a health care professional I felt the same way about vaccines. I understand vaccine hesitancy. Ultimately, I weighed the risks versus benefit and got vaccinated.
0/0	As a health care professional myself I will not get it.
0/0	As a health care worker. I won‚Äôt be getting it either.
1/1/1/1	As a healthcare worker I am always amazed how the majority of the population can't do college level science but are suddenly virology majors. I wish they had medical training and could comprehend the stupidity of their "expertise".
0/0	As a healthcare worker, I will not be getting it, nor will my family
1/1	As a healthcare worker, I'm incredibly excited that my wife (also healthcare) and I may get vaccinated in the next couple of months.
1/1/1/1/1/1	As a healthcare worker, I'm incredibly excited that my wife (also healthcare) and I may get vaccinated in the next couple of months. That'll be such a load off, especially since she runs a Covid clinic at the moment.
0	As a healthy 32 year old I'm getting pressured to take the vaccine. From what I've researched, if you've had covid you have the antibodies and don't need the vaccine. 2nd, getting the vaccine doesn't prevent you spreading the virus. I've been told things like "It's not for you, it's for everyone else." If I feel confident in my ability to fight off the virus naturally why would I get vaccinated? Since the vaccine actually only helps my symptoms, it should be a personal choice because the consequences are personal. Currently I don't see a reason why I should take it, and I certainly don't like that many events will require the vaccine to attend. Unless the vaccine van prevent the spread why so much pressure to get vaccinated?
1/1	As a medical professional it kills me to hear people with zero education, experience or understanding preach to others about the ‚Äúdangers‚Äù of vaccines! If you don‚Äôt have knowledge or experience changing a transmission, are you going to change it yourself or possibly take your vehicle to a professional to ensure the job is done properly? The same principle applies to medical advice!
1/-1	As a midwife I‚Äôm pro vaccine.. But have real concerns of this idea of compulsory vaccine and shaming individuals and communities.. Last I checked we lived in a free country.. Look what‚Äôs in front of you rather than inventing problems.. Bring people with you and do not alienate
1/1	As a nurse in a nursing home, most of our building got vaccinated at the end of December and as of this week we have no covid patients for the first time since March 2020!
1/1	As a nurse working covid was the most demoralizing experience of my life. I went to grad school so i wouldnt have to work for a few years
1/1	As a nurse, I would have zero problem delivering the message that they're out of luck. We have a solution. Freaking use it.
0/0	As a passed middle aged adult with no underlying conditions, I will ALSO not get this shot!
1/1	As a pediatric ED physician , appreciate this post. Spread the importance of vaccines and allay the false notions ( autism , etc) . As you know , some of the vaccine preventable diseases are making a slight comeback .
1	As a pediatrician & mom, I want to personally thank you for using the Facebook platform to promote preventive medicine (vaccines), parental leave, and paternal involvement!!!!! I wish this altruistic and responsible use of social media was more widely adopted.
0/0	As a person who has terrible adverse affects to flu vaccination and almost all doctors medications I guess I'm going to take my chances without a vaccine no matter how well it turns out.
1/1	As a person with autism, I find it incredibly curious some people would rather have a sick or dead child than an autistic one
1/1	As a person with serious illnesses, that occasionally needs emergency services, I really think that all rescue and health professionals should be required to be vaccinated or go on non-paid leave until the pandemic is over. I've fought too long and hard, to survive metastatic breast cancer and a damaged heart, to get exposed to COVID because someone, who is supposed to be dedicated to providing safe, competent medical care, didn't want to get vaccinated. The same rule should apply to all police officers who interact with the public. They swear to protect and serve and they can't protect us if they are exposing us to a lethal disease.

1/1	As a scientist I am really proud of my collegues that worked on the development of these new vaccines
0/0	As a support worker I am absolutely disgusted that the vaccines are been mandated and I could loose my job if I don't get vaccinated with what is still an experimental vaccine we are going down a dark road.
1/1	As a teacher, make it a vape and you‚Äôd have at least 25% vaccinated in about a week.
1/1	As a woman with autism, it frustrates me to no end those that insist that vaccines cause autism. They do not, never have and never will! They save lives, and protect those who can't.
0/0	As a young adult with no underlying conditions. I will not get this shot.
1/1	As a young adult, I would gladly take this vaccine! It would probably be more effective in someone like me anyways and it's only one shot!
1/1	As a young person, I feel so grateful to have access to the mRNA vaccine for reducing the chance of experiencing long term complications from the COVID-19 virus, including hospitalisation or death.

1/1	As an autistic person with allergies who actually went into anaphylactic shock as a reaction to a COVID vaccine, I don't understand why people could possibly be anti-vax. I went to get my shot and had a reaction. The doctors gave me an epi-pen on site before I was rusehd off to the hospital where I was held under observation and given some additional meds, and was clear to go home in a couple of hours. I felt completely back to normal in two days. Yes, this is a serious reaction and it can be really scary, but you know what I think is scarier? All the lasting side-effects that the diseases can give you, or dying of them. I have a friend who used to run marathons and had COVID early on in the pandemic. She's still recovering and gets short of breath walking up the stairs. That's a much worse outcome to me than what I went through. All in all, I'm currently in a special medical program here for people who had a severe reaction but want to get fully vaccinated safely, and I refuse to let people try and use my experience with vaccines as an argument that GETTING SICK and DYING or suffering LONG LASTING COMPLICATIONS is somehow BETTER than running the small risk of feeling bad for a couple of days. And thats not even adressing the hate people have against autism! Vaccines don't cause autism, it's been debunked again and again. And even if they did, are you telling me you hate me so much you'd rather let your kids potentially suffer or die of a completely preventable disease? Because if that's your stance I don't even know where to start. And those allergies I meantioned? I'd much rather deal with those than with the measles or polio or COVID. Anyone who'd like to debate this with me I'd LOVE to hear your stance and arguments.
1/1	As an average vaccinated person starts to reduce and clears the viable virus much faster than the average unvaccinated person.
1/1	As an epidemiologist, I loved this. Is clear now that we will have to learn to live with the Covid. And sadly some many factors that helped for the Smallpox are long gone. We can only hope we can learn from this because is a matter of time for the next time.
1/1	As an immunocompromised person, I very happily received my 4th COVID vaccine. Since many others don‚Äôt care about protecting me‚Ä¶gotta do everything I can to protect myself!
1/1	As an under-30 who‚Äôs had a jab, this doesn‚Äôt concern me. There are always gonna be risks but I‚Äôd rather a 1 in a million chance of getting a blood clot than not have a 90% effective vaccine being administered at large.
0/0	As each day goes on, I am beyond thankful to myself for not being forced into taking a #Covid19Vaccine Like it‚Äôs clearly all unravelling.
0/1	As everybody‚Äôs immune system responds differently to the vaccine, it is very likely some people gain no protection despite being vaccinated. But thankfully, this is rare, and less than 10% of recipients gain no protection.

0/0	As for the genetic therapy misleadingly called a vaccination
1	As for the risk of vaccines, the risk of any serious adverse effect from the vaccines is far lower than the risk of death from covid-19 in any age group And we have far more idea of the risk of long term adverse effects from the vaccines than we do long-term effects of covid-19

1/-1	As long as it is free for everyone, and NOT just the people you deem as "needy". We all need this vaccine to be free, if the virus is even as remotely as dangerous as claimed.
1/1	As long as it protects you from the virus, ie you don't die or get hospitalized, the vaccine has done it's job

1/1	As long as they're safe. They have to be safe while you rush through to get them out!
1/1	As made apparent by some of the comments, we have a strange amount of anti vaxxers in society. It‚Äôs surprising considering that without vaccines and modern medicine, many of us wouldn‚Äôt have made it to adulthood. Try not to let conspiracies override commonsense.
1/-1	As much as I recommend the vaccine I applaud you and support your decision, nobody should be forced to take it and you have to do what you believe is the right thing for you no matter what anyone else thinks or says.
0/0	As much as I'm glad that a vaccine is being used. I'm scared about the long-term health effects of a rushed vaccine.
1/1	As of 30/01/22, 4% of 5-11 year olds in France have received at least one vaccine (60% in Spain) and each week approximately 500 children and adolescents aged 1 to 17 are hospitalised for COVID-19, 200 of whom are aged 5-11. The vaccine is safe and effective, protect yourself, Omicron is not a cold!
1/1	As of April 18 I'll be 2 months fully vaccinated. Still feeling good. Wish the vaccine could have gotten rid of allergies. Maybe given me some more arms since I'm a Pharmacy Technician and we are SLAMMED daily between doing Covid testing, Covid vaccines and our normal every day stuff. Even fully staffed we struggle

0/0	As safe as the Titanic .
1/1	As scientist and medical professionals have been saying since before this started: there is no single magic bullet. Epidemiology consists of multiple layers of protection, each of which reduces one or more of the risk of infection, transmission, or severity
0/0	As somebody who has been working in the pharmaceutical industry for 5+ years and the last 4 of it in Clinical Trials. There's a reason why it takes 4yrs to get approved and for that reason i'm bowing out of taking the vaccine for at least a year.
1	As someone in education I'd feel its irresponsible not to try my beat to keep the kids safe
0/0	As someone who already had COVID. Why would I get the vaccine? When, 1. Getting COVID twice is very rare. 2. Even if you get COVID, your chances of dying are like 0.000001%. 3. I got a negative test and am no longer contagious.
1/1	As someone who got the vaccine and someone who loves pop culture, I think of the vaccine and virus in terms of old western movies. Imagine there is a bounty, and a bounty hunter sees a wanted poster for the bounty. People see the warrant as well then see the actual person from the bounty and immediately know that‚Äôs the person to stop. That‚Äôs basically more or less how the vaccine works against the virus and how your body more or less responds when coming into contact with the actual virus
1/1	As someone who had blood clots in my legs in my early 20s from birth control pills, I'll take any vaccine you'll give me.
1/1	As someone who had covid last year pretty bad, and also has bad allergies to normal things and medications I still chose to take the risk and get vaccinated. Thankfully no allergies to the vaccine and I‚Äôm so glad I got it. I would rather take a risk of having an allergic reaction to that than ever having covid like I did last year. It was so scaring not feeling like I could breathe and not knowing if I would wake up. I unfortunately have trumpanzees in my family who think it‚Äôs horrible that my immediate family got vaccinated even though they had covid last year as well but still deny it‚Äôs real
0/1	As someone who has first hand experience of this, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs frustrating to watch people who make decisions to not get vaccinated based on falsehoods.
0/0	As someone who has had COVID twice I will pass...It‚Äôs the same as the flu shot it‚Äôs a choice I don‚Äôt pass judgement on those that vaccinate because it‚Äôs their body their choice...we never judged those who decline a flu shot so why judge about COVID! I have a child that had severe allergic reaction to flu shot the one time we said yes and I say no to COVID....don‚Äôt let‚Äôs others decision to vax or not vax be what makes your decision do it for yourself!
1/1	As someone who has still not had their sense of smell 100% return since having covid, these anti vax people anger me. Thats something that I now have to deal with for the rest of my life.
1/1/1	As someone who has studied viruses and worked in research labs on other coronaviruses like MERS-cov and SARS-cov, it makes me laugh to hear Erika say "that's not a risk she's willing to take" because the risks of the disease are far more dangerous than the worst risks of the vaccine.
1/1	As someone who wants myself and my family to take the vaccine, I welcome this news.
1/1	As someone who was BORN with almost no IGG immunity, vaccinations saved my life.
0/0	As someone with autoimmune diseases I am concerned about the risk of getting endless boosters since the last thing I need are MORE autoimmune issues. I've had three vaccines and I still got omicron so I think I'm done with the vaccines.
1/0	As someone with disability and no immune system, I probably can't get the vaccine since I'm unable to get the flu shot. I've been self isolating on and off for six years. Ive only left my house about a handful of times. We should be listening to people who know about these things. Thank you to the man who said getting the vaccine not for themselves but people they don't know; that's people like me. We are all scared. Please think of others and not just yourself.
1/1	As soon as I can get this vaccine I will be rolling up my sleeve. A day or two of flu like symptoms is better than 3 weeks on a ventilator.
1/1	As soon as I can, I will be vaccinated. The only way to deal with this pandemic right now. Thank you for your engagement
1/1	As soon as I can, I will be vaccinated. The only way to deal with this pandemic right now. Thank you for your engagement.
1/1	As soon as I can, yes. Obviously immunocompromosed, elderly, and frontline workers come first but I‚Äôve been in quarantine three times this year. I‚Äôm sick of it.
1/1	As soon as I can. I can't afford to die/get severe complications from Covid-19. I am 51 and I need it! 2 friends have several severe complications from having it.
1/1	As soon as it‚Äôs available on the NHS, I will be happy to have it.
1/1	As soon as it‚Äôs opened up to cancer patients here in Alberta you can bet I will be getting this vaccine with no concerns!
1/1	As soon as my governor said that essential workers would be able to get the Covid vaccine, I hurried to the website to book my vaccine appointment. Tomorrow, I will have reached immunity from the Johnson and Johnson Vaccine.
1/1	As soon as people can‚Äôt get on a plane to Benidorm without a vaccine you‚Äôll see a dramatic increase in the uptake.
1/1	As soon as they say I can take mine I‚Äôll gladly go get it.
0/0	As supervisor of a district heavily impacted by COVID, I am deeply concerned that despite overwhelming evidence of vaccine safety and efficacy there remains a debate around the value of getting vaccinated ... It is our responsibility.
0/-1	As the "vaccine" is a bioweapon in disguise, they realize it would be a war crime to vaccinate the prisoners. That's why they aren't doing it.
1/1	As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, getting the vaccine is a powerful step in taking charge of your health. When given as directed, the FDA-authorized vaccines can prevent severe COVID-19 illness and death.

1/0/1	As the vaccine become available, be prepared to see a lot more anti-vaxx posts and shares. Be careful to ensure your information comes from a credible website. It‚Äôs normal to be worried but vaccination is the only way out of this.
1	As the vaccine becomes available many people might feel they should not get it. But as suggested in the article, by getting it you could take care of your family in the event someone in your house gets sick.
0/0	As there is absolutely no medical justification this can only be mass genocide of the population by vaccination.
0/0	As these vaccines are in the experimental phases we can't make such assessments. Heavily vaccinated countries show high rates of infection. The only observable effects of the vaccines is a dampened down hospitalisation rate. I think these figures have been manipulated by various agencies who benefit financially from the sale of these vaccines.
0/1	As they are the most vulnerable, and there's a shortage, they'll perhaps have enough of the Pfizer for them. If not, the German state will have a lower bill for the old-age pensions in a few months time.
0/-1	As they get their fake shot they laugh at the dumb people that believe its man kinds savior
0/0	As they increase the vaccine shots . The more cases of covid increases ! The people were told , wash hands , wear masks , lock downs , close business , 6feet social distancing and don't see family members because this can increase your risk of getting exposed ! Now let's inject you with a virus straight into your bloodstream ?!? This is now good for you ?!? The people getting vaccinated are becoming walking Petri dishes and helping to infect health people in the public .
1/1	As they should. And once the vaccine is widely available, they should require all passengers to show proof of vaccination or medical waiver.
0/0	As they should. Those promoting kids vaccines should also VOLUNTEER to be on a list to hold them accountable should these vaccines turn to be harmful ?
0/0	As usual, Dement*a Joe Biden does not know what he is talking about!!! My body my choice
1/1	As we distribute more vaccine, we‚Äôre getting closer to beating this pandemic.
1/1	As we face compounding crises, I am feeling very blessed to have received my 2nd #COVID19Vaccine dose today. I encourage everyone to roll up your sleeve when your time comes. #VaccinesWork
0/0	As we have seen, some people live in alternate realities where the vaccine stops transmission or illness #sad #mentalhealth
1/1	As we push through this winter, get your #COVIDVaccine to help keep yourself and others safe. Get #boosted if it is time. Visit aacounty.org/covidvax
1/1	As you are a vital health care worker, I hope you have either already been vaccinated or gotten an appointment to get one in the next few days, SD.
0/1	Aside from COVID-19, mRNA could really be the future. It's possibilities are huge.
0/0	Aside from the sophistry of wearing masks, I WILL NOT take any #COVID19 #vaccine. ZERO of the normally mandated Phase 4 (long-term side effect) studies done (usually 6-10 years). Using fear as a tool illustrates the disingenuous nature of those controlling the population.
1/-1	Ask 1000 people whether they would want to vaccinate. 500 says no The press: half of Britons don't want a vaccination
0/0	Ask labor and delivery nurses about the increase in old blood clots seen on the placentas in women covid vaccinated in their pregnancy.
0/0	Ask me in a year what I think about this experiment vaccine? Because I‚Äôm not taking it.
0/0	Ask yourself this: How did the human race survive thousands of years of exposure to all sorts of nasty bacteria, germs and viruses before vaccines came about? It's called an immune system.
0/0	Ask yourself: Will you develop CANCER quicker or not, by taking a vaccine booster shot (chemicals) every 6 months for the rest of your life? üíâü¶Äüíâü¶Äüíâü¶Äüíâ
0/-1	Ask yourselves this - if these vaccines are so great, why would 70,000 healthcare workers who risked their lives working through Covid in 2020 chose getting fired rather then getting the vaccine? It does make you think (those of you who are still capable of doing so).
0/0	Asking vaxxed person less than a year about long-term effects of vaccine is as useful as asking smoker after a year of smoking whether they got cancer.In 1st case nobody knows or guarantee anything (with mRNA/VV vaccines),in 2nd case you are very likely to develop cancer later.
1/1	Aspirin has side effects u all gonna stop taking that too?
0/-1	Associate Professor Mary-Ann Davies tells me that the most common #covishield vaccine side-effects are: 1. Pain in the area where the injection has been administered 2. Mild flu and a bit of nausea or dizziness
0/0	Astra Zeneca Vaccines have been stopped in Denmark and other European countries due to reported blood clots!
0/0	AstraZeneca is useless!!
1/1/-1/1	AstraZeneca says it aims to have a ‚Äònext generation‚Äô Covid vaccine ready for use in the autumn which will incorporate some of the mutated variants of concern. Work well underway to design new vaccine structure at Oxford.
1/1/1/1/1	AstraZeneca seems to be more effective and researched. It seems promising and not rushed. I'll wait on them.
1/1	AstraZeneca would be my choice for sure.
0/1	Astrazeneca covishield. Just a bit of arm soreness and fatigue the next day.
1/1	Astrazeneca. Arm was a bit sore for two days. Have to have the second shot next month
0	At 1 point there were only 6 deaths from Covid as well. Just because they only found 6 doesn't mean there aren't any more.
1/1	At BKC jumbo Covid centre I and my wife got 2nd dose of Covishield under dean Dr. Dere. We record our appreciation for excellent arrangements made by all the staff working at spread over makeshift centre under able supervision of Dr. Dere.
1/1	At a rate of about 2 per million.No medical procedure is without risk.But the vaccine risk is far outweighed by the much greater risk from covid.
1/1	At first I was against the JJ vaccine but when you realize it can keep you out of the hospital and prevent death I said ok. So that's what I got.
1/1	At first I was in the position to reject vaccination because I was worried and in the state of anxiety however I decided to be vaccinated if it is Pfizer or Moderna, thanks God I have done with 2 doses of Modernna and I am very confident after being vaccinated. Vaccination is a great help in terms of our health and safety. Do our part be vaccinated!
1/1	At first, my mom was hesitant to get the vaccine. But when I had covid just last yr September, she immediately took it after the quarantine. I guess my mom was traumatized so that's why she got the covid vaccine lol
0/0	At his confirmation hearing today, Desantis‚Äô Surgeon General nominee Joseph Ladapo is asked a simple question: Are the covid vaccines safe and effective? He refuses to answer the question.
1/1	At last my Dad has been given the #vaccine so relieved
0/0	At least 75 percent of people I have spoken to say there isn‚Äôt any way in hell they are taking it

0/-1	At least I will not be having any vaccine side effects since I will not be taking it. EVER
0/0	At least the USA is ethical enough to stop roll out after clotting events in order to spare other countries, Great Britain rolled AZ vaccine out anyway despite of many complications and clotting incidents with the vaccine in several countries.
1/1	At least three-quarters of residents in most U.S. skilled nursing facilities had received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Keep up the great work.
1/1	At least we have a vaccine so the pandemic so about to end.
1/1	At least we know there is a vaccine that works.
1/1	At least your body won't turn into a coronavirus duplication factory if you get successfully vaccinated.
1/1	At my hospital only 40% of our staff have been vaccinated. It‚Äôs so disheartening. We‚Äôve had the vaccine since December 18th. I signed up the very minute the appointments were available.
1/1	At my work it‚Äôs the lazy bad nurses who don‚Äôt want to get the vaccine. So bye-bye I didn‚Äôt like working with you anyway!
0/0	At one time not that long ago, doctors encouraged smoking even for pregnant women. Of corise, now we know how damaging smoking is to the human body. What will we learn about the #CovidVaccine 5/10 years from now?
1/-1	At some point it has to be personal responsibility
1/-1	At some point someone had to say it. Your an asshole cause it‚Äôs not about you it‚Äôs about giving it to others
0/0	At the end of the day its your own choice but theres no way in hell im getting vaccinated lol
1/1	At the end of the day, the vaccine is safe. We've seen enough evidence pointing to the fact that it is and little evidence pointing to the fact that it isn't. Going on the anti vaxx hill is not something republicans should fight on.
0/0	At the highest levels of the medical cartel, vaccines are a top priority because they cause a weakening of the immune system. I know that may be hard to accept, but its true. The medical cartel, at the highest level, is not out to help people, it is out to harm them, to weaken them. To kill them. At one point in my career, I had a long conversation with a man who occupied a high government position in an African nation. He told me that he was well aware of this. He told me that WHO is a front for these depopulation interests
1/1	At the moment we have only vaccines. To find medicines needs more time. We have to return at our life, and to do it, all the world have to be vaccinated. At the moment is the only way to get out from the pandemic.
0/0	At the same time it's killing some people.
0/0	At the same time you face legal consequences for not taking the vaccine, there are NO legal consequences for recklessly and fraudulently manufacturing a vaccine like J&J got caught doing with 14M doses. 14M doses with the wrong ingredient is not a mistake, that‚Äôs fraud. And what‚Äôs the consequences? Nothing. Nothing at all...
0/-1	At the same time, many people are ambivalent because, while they want to protect themselves against infection, they also fear possible side effects from vaccination.
0/-1	At this moment I had a message from my friend from someone she know after he took the vaccine and had a stroke he is 23y
1/0	At this point anti-vaxxing is natural selection at its finest and probably quickest.
0/0	At this point tho, with the virus weakening, I'm probably done with covid vaccines.
1/1	At this point, I would rather get the AstraZeneca vaccine on an airplane while on birth control than get COVID.
1/1	At this point, if the vaccines work for the 6 months to under 5 age-group, let us get as many of these kids vaccinated as possible.
1/1	At this point, it is these unvaccinated folks who cause societal stresses associated with COVID waves - they overwhelm our hospitals, burn out healthcare workers, often are anti-mask and test and send their kids to school sick while refusing to allow them to be tested in school‚Ä¶
0/0	At this point, the ONLY reason vaccination is being pushed is for $$$
1/1	At this point, the question has to be how many people are going to be co winners of a Nobel prize. Three viable vaccines this week, a year after sars-covid2 was even discovered. Phenomenal.
0/1	At this point, those of us who have chosen not to be vax‚Äôd, will gladly raise our middle thinger until the very end. There is not a single thing you or anyone else can do to change that aside from war, you ready?
0/0	At this rate the EU will be recommending an Asprin with hot chocolate as a vaccination!
1/1	At this rate, everyone will be vaccinated by the end of 2021. Hopefully the rate continues to go up.
0/-1	At what month or year after taking a vaccine for Covid do you become sterile or your health deteriorates until death? And by then nobody will question or even think about you being sterile or have died because of the vaccine you took a few months or years ago. The pushers of the vaccines response? In public, "we didnt know" In private, "Mission accomplished"
1/-1	At work today, our company was notifying us that we have free flu shot vouchers that we can print and use at any pharmacy. This lady said ‚ÄúThe mRNA contains aborted fetus cells and i am a Christian I unfortunately can‚Äôt be pro life and pro vax at the same time.‚Äù A couple people agreed with her. Where did this aborted fetus cells shit come from?! I simply cannot understand how a person gets to the point where they believe something like that.
1/1	Augurs well. Soon all the states will be Covid free.
0/0	Australia - Citizens opposed to vaccine genocide block roads to Canberra airport. We have to go now!
0/-1	Australia - Military press conference. Freudian Slip or Brain Fart? ‚ÄúYou should remember that the consequences of the vaccines are worse than any of the potential side effects‚Äù
0/0	Australian unvaxxed here: I learnt to grow my own food and build with rammed earth and cobb. The amazing things you learn when you are forced out of society. Once you know how simple it is to live a good life you can only look at big cities with sheer horror.
1/1	Autism isn't something you acquire, it's something you're born with.
0/0	Autism was never heard of in the scientific community until they started administrating vaccines in the 30's.
1/1/1/1	Average age of my hospitalized COVID patients today is ~40 years (compared to 70 years a few months ago). Soft reminder to all the young people still undecided about the COVID vaccine. Hospital isn‚Äôt a good meeting point. Get your vaccine please.

1/1	BEGONE ANTI-VAX FAR RIGHT
0/0	BEWARE!! What is good news about SKIPPING TESTING?? It's not going to "put this to bed"!!! i was flu vaccine injured in 2012 - in short, it took me 3 years to be able to use a fork and a knife again to eat. it was horrific, the worst experience of my entire life. I am now disabled, will never work again and have permanent neurological damage - I have constant neuropathic pain. it took EIGHT YEARS to go thru the "Vaccine Court" process only to win a fraction of my losses. If you are damaged by the COVID vaccine, you are screwed. You are not protected and you will be damaged. If you get the flu, you won't die!!! If you do, it's your time. I would rather have died than live the life I have with constant pain, unable to do things I love, unable to work. My condition will worsen as I age and I will suffer more and more and more.

0/0	Based off the current data. I have a .02 % chance of dying from covid. I've already had covid. My chance of having a negative effect from the vaccine is .5% it's higher than covid risk. Can anyone logically tell me why I should get the shot.
1/1	Based on current knowledge, experts believe that COVID-19 vaccines are unlikely to pose a risk to a person trying to become pregnant in the short or long term
0/0	Based on the deaths and hospitalizations, it makes zero sense to vaccinate children. And what is the data on children that require hospitalization? Do they have underlying health issues or are they healthy, normal weight active kids? That makes a huge difference and can help parents make reasonable decisions.
1/1	Based on what I know the only side effect of vaccines is a child crying because they‚Äôre afraid of needles
1/1	Based on what has been proved about vaccines for other diseases, the COVID-19 vaccine may help keep you from getting seriously ill, even if you do get the virus

0/0	Beautiful woman reporters! I‚Äôve taken a Covid-19 vaccine and flu shot and I felt horrible! So I‚Äôm thinking twice before getting the rest of them! Especially when dealing with existing health concern and I don‚Äôt want to make me worse!
1/1	Beauty! Congrats to Germany, the vaccination machine is now really starting to get going. A much more normal summer is in sight for so many countries.
0/0	Because 1) bill gates made it himself with the promise of getting rid of 15% of the population approximately as he stated before that the world is overpopulated 2) you don't need it as survival rate for the virus is over 99% if it even exists 3) vaccines are toxic, especially ones made by psychotic elites who once upon a time went to inject people in poor countries and crippled and killed some of them. Need I go on..
1/1	Because 1.4 million deaths are too many. Let‚Äôs stop this madness
0/0	Because 95% effifacy rate was fake. It was tested by Pfizer and Moderna themselves. It was B737 Max part 2.0
0/0/-1	Because I don‚Äôt want to have it, end of.
1/1	Because I know enough science to know that getting the vaccine is a MUCH better bet than getting COVID. In all likely hood you will be getting it soon yourself, do you really think that we will allow disease carrying morons to wander around loose for ever?
0/0	Because I prefer to avoid guinea pigging myself with experimental doses of gene code. Particularly when I know that the code is designed to make my cells start abnormally creating a spike protein that is strange to my body and causes my immune system to fight against it. I also realize there are very few people on the planet who have ever tried injecting gene code in such a way before, so outcomes are very unpredictable. Research into human reverse transcriptase, however, I believe, should make anyone extremely cautious. Idk, I just don't think it's a great idea to do anything like that experimentally with my body and I absolutely would never insist or mandate anyone else do it to theirs.
1/1	Because I want to keep myself and my family safe from the virus. Vaccine is important in order to discontinue or stop the spread of the covid virus.
0/0	Because I've got lots of common Sense, a good immune system, and I don't really want to play any part in gates' gene therapy experiment.
1/1	Because I‚Äôve never had a problem with a vaccine before and I‚Äôm well over 50. Furthermore, this one is built on top of longstanding research that shows no reason to distrust it. Finally, The people who say it is safe are far more credible than those who say that it is not. None of that is a guarantee, but it seems to me that the risk of problems from the vaccine is FAR less than that of the virus, and the statistics are bearing that out.
1	Because YOU Spread it to her REST Of us. I can‚Äôt stand you Tin foil hat Conspiracy theorist taking up the non left wing. You have the civil liberties to drink bleach because only you is affected. You do NOT have the right to threaten and spread disease to the rest of us. Man, like ungrateful liberals, you guys have it too easy and forgot how important vaccinations are
0/0	Because all side effects are being referred back to the vaccine makers .... not any medical studies are being done
0/0/0/0	Because as one doctor said "its not a V@c. Its gene manipulation" humans are the lab rats in this new test..
1/0	Because her daughter can‚Äôt get vaccinated, she should be begging everyone else to get vaccinated.
1/1	Because idiots won‚Äôt get the shot so we can eradicate this thing once and for all
0/0	Because if you are vaccinated, you can‚Äôt get, spread or die from Covid? Not sure if you covid nazis have noticed, but the vaccine isn‚Äôt really working anymore. The government‚Äôs ‚Äúscience‚Äù is bullshit & if you use commonsense, you‚Äôll see it. Lol
1/1	Because in the end, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) avoided Trump‚Äôs attempts to play politics with our safety. Thank you to the FDA career professionals
0/0	Because it doesn't work, FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY...VACCINE RUSHED TO PISH POLITICAL AGENDA, MORE PEOPLE WILL SUFFER AND DIE BC OF IGNORANCE AND SELFLESSNESS
0/0	Because it doesn‚Äôt even meet the true definition of Vaccine. It is ineffective and it is not safe for some people. I have had Covid, I required no treatment and was just fine in a few days. The immunity that I already have is better, stronger and longer lasting than the ‚Äòvaccine‚Äô will give me anyway, and I didn‚Äôt risk my life to get it. I hear there is a shortage of vaccines, they can give mine to anyone else who wants it.
0/0	Because it is a brand new vaccine, and needs at least 4-10 years to prove it is safe. This one has been rushed out too soon, period end of story.
0/0	Because it is codified in the US code of federal regulations that you cannot question the safety of vaccines whether or not the claim is well founded as of 1984.
0/0	Because it is not really needed, it doesn't work, it does have side effects and it is experimental regardless of FDA approval.
1/1	Because it is the best, proven medical tool to prevent serious illness/death from Covid19. Of course physical distancing, masking, also help too. You‚Äôre welcome.
0/0	Because it took them less than a year to develop it. Seems a bit fishy, like they had covid planned.
1/1	Because it will be a communal and healing experience: to wait our turn, to make sure the people who need it the most get it first, to do something as a country all at once, to watch the herd immunity build in all of us. To crush this bug, we need to all do it together
0/0	Because it's NOT A VACCINE,,,IT'S POISON
0	Because it's NOT natural 100%. This virus clearly has been engineered in a lab. And now is behaving like a biological weapon. Even the OMS hasn't ruled this out yet.
0/0	Because it's toxic!
0	Because most corona vaccines rely on machine learning and caluculation by high performance computers - complex ‚Äúimaginary number‚Äù analysis in their development phase. The technology is originated in nuclear development. The mathematical concept is originated in Babylonian numerology. That is the reason for me enough to doubt the scientific literacy of such developers. I know some vaccine does not adopt the equation. So if vaccine becomes duty, I will choose the ones without complex analysis.
1/0	Because not all the vulnerable CAN be vaccinated, as shown in this very news item. There's no proof yet that the vaccine doesn't reduce your ability to infect others.
0/0	Because not everyone thinks it's a miracle... some people think its damaging ... I'm not getting it unless I see there are no side effects....
0/0	Because of the "spike protein" vax, many vaccinated people will be stuck with permanently suboptimal immune responses.
1/1	Because of your advice and videos doctor I was able to convince my mom and father in law to take vaccine thanks doctor
0	Because of your timing to announce this after the election, me and about 70 million other Americans will boycott Pfizer for eternity
1/1	Because people do not get vaccinated, the virus can continue to spread strongly and therefore a great many people have to die. It is as simple as that.
1/1	Because so far, nearly 100 million doses of vaccine have been given and there has been only one death which might, possibly, have been due to a bad reaction to the vaccine. One in 100 million is a lot less than the risk of dying from, say, eating a toffee.
0/0	Because so many are having bad reactions and I have many allergies I think I will opt out until more is known about these drugs.
0/0	Because some part of you knows that the media is lying? Because the pandemic is a hoax?
0/0	Because the long term effects of these vaccines are impossible to assess because it hasn't been tested long term. That's undeniable.
0/1	Because the mRNA approach to vaccines is new, you might have seen claims and worries about what might happen after it‚Äôs injected into the body.
0/0	Because the one sell vaccine is the one who created the virus.. Booom
0/0	Because the vaccine is completely worthless. Early effective treatment is cheap and available but they are deliberately demonizing them inorder to promote forced vaccination.
0/0	Because the vaccine isn‚Äôt made to keep you ‚Äúsafe‚Äù my friend. They don‚Äôt care about your health or wealth.
1/1	Because the vaccine was made using techniques that had been refined over a period of over 10 years and previously used to work on vaccines for things like Ebola. We just didn‚Äôt hear much about those because Ebola was contained, mostly by isolation, before widespread immunization could be rolled out. Because it was tested and passed by multiple panels of scientists with more relevant credentials than yours, mine or the person you follow on Twitter. Literally millions of people have received COVID-19 vaccine with only a very tiny minority (less than 1 in 100,000) have had a serious problem like blood clots. Headaches, body aches, sore arms and being tired for a couple of days don‚Äôt count as safety problems. They are NOTHING compared to symptomatic COVID, which at least 10% (1 in 10) of the unimmunized population has had. Because nearly all of those that have received the vaccine have not gotten symptomatic COVID-19 and only a VERY tiny number have had serious COVID-19 and been hospitalized or died. 2/3 of the people that did have severe COVID-19 after immunization had pre-existing problems with their immunity that kept them from receiving full benefit from their vaccine. (Vaccines tell your immune system how to get ready to fight the virus or bacteria they are against. If your immune system is unable to respond, either due to a rare genetic syndrome, or more likely due to a blood cancer like leukemia or immune suppressing drugs, like chemotherapy or drugs for diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, then it is the defect in the immune system‚Äôs ability to respond, not a problem with the vaccine that caused the ‚Äúfailure‚Äù.) Because all I really need to know that it is a at least 1000 times safer than taking my chances with COVID without it!
1/1/1	Because the virus is a lot worse. There is no reason to believe that these vaccines will persist in the body beyond a few weeks let alone months. I‚Äôm not saying they will be 100% safe, people might have all sorts of strange reactions to it, but if I can stop this virus from spreading and killing thousands of old people I will. Even if there is little risk from the virus to me. We take many bigger risks every day than this vaccine. have you ever read the ingredients list on your food? there are more untested chemical mixes in the latest alcopop than a vaccine.
1/1	Because there are still people stupid enough to avoid a life saving vaccine?
0/0	Because there is a good risk assessment for the contraceptive pill before it is prescribed individually, unlike the vaccine
0/0	Because they are all equally useless. Except for giving you strokes.
1/0	Because they are still requiring mask, the whole point of the vaccine is to stop this madness
0/0	Because they aren't sheep!
0/-1	Because they have started to wake up and feel inner strength...........No way any government can stop this.
0/0	Because they know its poison
1/1	Because they're purposely ignorant. That's why they refuse.
0/0	Because this vaccine is the most ineffective vaccine in history and is killing kids and causing heart problems- seeing how you and so many are willing to sacrifice kids to maybe give you a 5% chance at an extra year or two of life and make big Pharma rich-you are the bad guy.
0/-1	Because why take an unproven, experimental vaccine that doesn't prevent Covid-19, where we're being told that we would STILL need to wear a mask and social distance even after getting it!?
0/0	Because with the disease you know better at the moment what to expect, with the vaccination not yet.
0	Because you're all guineapigs, vaccine is still under trial until 2023.
1/1	Because, unlike politics these days, science actually works. It. Can be TESTED. Results can be MEASURED. And you know what , lives can be SAVED! Remember trust but verify‚Ä¶ well it has been verified, so trust that if you are vaccinated, you will not die from the virus. And just as important if you happened to be exposed to it, the chances of spreading it to others is very low. So do not let superstition, politics or fear of needles dissuade you. Get the shot !!!
1/1	Been 5 months since the vaccine -- no deaths in my family. :) I mean, the death rate of COVID might be only 1%, but I'm not stupid enough to refuse a vaccine which has a 0.001% (I'm being generous here) death rate.
1/1/1	Been Covid positive twice already,have auto immune disease and had my first dose of covid jab! Hurrah! I'm still alive!
1/1	Been getting them for 56 years and I‚Äôm just fine.
1/1	Been on a trial. With this vaccine. No problems. Little side effects, glad to hear all these news updates. A very powerful vaccine. Glad to have been on the trial with synexus
1/1	Been surrounded by people with covid. Vaccinated..and boostered. Did not get it. It s magic. Thank you SO much.
1/1	Before about two centuries when the first vaccine-smallpox - the "smartpants" of that era used to believe that we will all turn into calfs and we will growl and other! Its like it hasnt passed a day.........!
0/0	Before even watching, I knew the goal of this video: "Find uneducated people who don't want the vaccine for stupid reasons." This way, viewers who don't think critically will falsely conclude everyone who refuses to get it is doing so for stupid reasons.
1/-1	Before he died of Covid-19 in September, Nick Bledsoe was not shy about publicly sharing his opposition to masks and vaccines on Facebook. In April, Mr. Bledsoe, an auto mechanic from Opelika, Ala., added a frame declaring "I dont care if youve had your vaccine" to his profile photo and urged his father not to get the shot. During the summer, he posted a petition against school mask requirements, cursed President "Biden and his vaccine," and in his final post, shared a video casting doubt on the safety of vaccination against the coronavirus. Then, with his last words before being placed on a ventilator, Mr. Bledsoe agreed to get vaccinated once he recuperated, according to his father. But he never left the hospital, dying at the age of 41 and leaving behind a wife and four children. The day after Mr. Bledsoe died, his father started urging those who were unvaccinated to get the shots.
1/-1	Before recommending COVID-19 vaccination for children, scientists conducted clinical trials with thousands of children and no serious safety concerns were identified.
0/0	Before the vaccine was available, none of my friends even got covid, and I'm the only one who did and I didn't even know I had it until after I got an antibody test weeks later. Millions have gotten sick since being vaxxed. I say you're full of shit
0/0	Before vaccination: risk of infection After vaccination: infected. Great way to speed up the process. Let‚Äôs all go get infected shall we! Said no one EVER.
1/1	Beginning of the end.... of the pandemic*
1/-1	Being a celebrity doesn‚Äôt mean you are exempt from COVID-19 rules. Follow the guidelines, Keep others and yourself safe, Wash your hands (20 seconds minimum), Wear your mask... Get your vaccine!!
1/1	Being against the vaccine is like looking at a library card and going i fucking hate u so bad'
1/1	Being anti vax is like choosing to swim across a crocodile infested river instead of using the bridge because you're scared of the bridge collapsing
0	Being experimental with no long term data! Thank you but its a hard pass for me!
0/0	Being hesitant about Covid vaccination is a perfectly valid position. Not everyone is convinced that these vaccines are safe, and the "efficacy" data is still very limited.
1/1	Being in the last-priority category for a vaccine is really nerve-wracking rn ......
1/1	Being part of the solution
0/0	Being pumped full of who knows what, still they wouldn‚Äôt be liable, so keep injecting and tell them it‚Äôs good for them, they believed the plandemic, they‚Äôll believe anything we tell them too!!
0/0	Being pumped full of who knows what, still they wouldn‚Äôt be liable, so keep injecting and tell them it‚Äôs good for them, they believed the plandemic, they‚Äôll believe anything we tell them too!!!
1/1	Being skeptic about the long term effects of the vaccine is fine, but then you should also consider the unknown long term effects of the virus and the increased probability of future infection. Why would the medicine be more dangerous than the infectious disease?
1/1	Being the mom of a 17 year old who received all his scheduled shots I also am a supporter of vaccines.
1/1	Being vaccinated greatly reduces the chance of becoming infected, and if infected the course is much shorter for a vaccinated person. Mutations / variants can only occur in infected persons.
1/1	Being vaccinated was important for me to protect myself and my family.
0/0	Being vaxxed is one thing. Being immune is ANOTHER thing (completely different)!
0/0	Believe in Jesus christ, Covid vaccine comes from Hell
1/1	Believe in science

1/1	Believing in science is a good thing
0/0	Ben do you honestly telling us you believe the vaccine is safe??? I held your intelligence at a higher standard, now I'm just speechless
1/1/0	Bend over for big pharma everybody!
0/0	Benefits out weight the risks! Tell that to the 28 year old who had a heart attack
0/0	Benefits outweigh the risk? You are not vaccinating cattle here! How does it benefit the person with a blood clot in their brain!?
1/-1	Berkeley researchers have now found 20 compounds that in combination with remdesivir, are much better than remdesivir alone in protecting human lung cells from SARS-CoV-2
1/1	Best News ever! My mum has been shielding since 23 March 2020 apart from short stint back at work Aug-Dec she‚Äôs not left the house, been shopping or socialised for 12 months. On Monday she has her 1st dose COVID vaccine. This has made my 2021. Thank you #NHS
0/0	Best advice I can give is try and dodge this for at least another 2 years. If it means no hols abroad then so be it, small price to pay.
1/1	Best birthday gift
1/-1	Best get it approved soon. I‚Äôve got a life to live here... couldn‚Äôt even give a toss about this virus now
1/1	Best if EU gets it's own and we will have our 5 vaccines for ourselves lovely
0/0	Best immunity is by turning off your TV
1/-1	Best news to day
0/0	Best thing I did was avoid any vaccine and I bought a ton of Pfizer stocks in 2019 during the crash of the market. Needless to say my Pfizer‚Äôs stocks are doing great and they are paying me dividends
1/1	Best thing I‚Äôve read in a VERY long time: my COVID-19 Vaccine Card!
0/0	Best thing for kids is that they catch it and get the immunity. Not stick them with some experimental garbage. Couldn‚Äôt make it through half the video shit hurts my brain too much.
1/1	Best thing is to be fully vaccinated + boosted + social distance and wear your mask. I am used to it now. Better be safe than sorry.
0/0	Best thing to do, is not take it
1	Best vaccine so far with effective results
0/0	Best vaccine, stop eating processed food, exercise, do intermittent fasting and get a little sun light (without sun screen).
1/1	Best vaccine. Had two jabs and no side effects
0/-1	Best way is to prevent the virus from infecting us by wearing face masks and physical distance as well as raising hygiene measures wpay out more important than vaccination
1/1	Bet the anti vax mob will all say the virus just disappeared of its own accord when mass vaccination protects them
0/0	Better because this vaccine is not safe. More dangerous than covid
1/1	Better chance to get hit by lightning. Vaccines will bring us out of this pandemic and bring life back to normal.
1/1	Better do that's the only reason I got the jab
0/1	Better for you than any of the vaccines is to actually get the Coronavirus and let your body build up a better immunity to it.
0/0	Better get your shot,British covid baby and Africa Ebola Covid baby could meet up and bring forth Godzilla's revenge. Or World war Z. I admit I've watched that movie a few times this last year. Prep work. Keep your vaccine, I never touch the stuff. Ever..

0/0	Better not use people without their consent as guinea pigs
0/0	Better pray than getting the vaccine.
1/-1	Better than Johnson&Johnson
1/1	Better than having Covid: I did and went to hospital. Not nice BUT I was lucky! I AM having the vaccine TODAY. I STRONGLY advise people to have it.
1/1	Better than nothing for now.
0/0	Better them than me. Who doesn't want a politicized and rushed vaccine injected into them?
0/0	Better to drink bleach. It kills everything.
0/0	Better to fight off a virus naturally with a 99.99% recovery rate than to chance a rushed vaccine that we can't even get direct answers about.. one has a clue about
0/1	Better vaccinate and certificate of Malaria cos it killing more people especially the younger children than Covid-19 In my country

1/1	Beyond grateful to all the staff involved in vaccination clinic in Connolly Hospital. Phenomenal roll out
0/0	Biden gets injected with sterile water
1/1	Biden pledges free Covid vaccine for 'everyone' in US if elected, this is surely something positive right?
1	Biden said he wants to be at 100 million vaccinated in his first 100 days in office, we are currently at 1.34 million a day so I think he will surpass that goal. It should be noted that we were doing 900k a day when he was inaugurated but a roughly 67% increase in 2 weeks is still good to see
0/0	Biden said there would be death for the unvaxxed. I am still here. I feel ripped off. The rona is 12 hrs behind me
1/0	Biden should start sending vaccines to Mexico and to other countries since people don‚Äôt want to that way maybe slow the virus around
0/0	Biden smiles and walks away when asked about responsibility for #COVID19 deaths and transparency about the origin of the virus. Say no to vaccine.
0/0	Biden will make the vaccine mandatory! Then he will talk about Corn Pop!
1/0	Biden's cautious approach should BOLSTER public confidence in our vaccine protocols.
1/1	Biden's vaccine deployment has been great.
1/1	Biden, Kamala, and Pence got theirs almost immediately just to name a few.
0/0	Big Pharma can't cure cancer or diabetes (because there is no money in it...they make more keeping you alive and treating you) but they develop Covid vaccines in months? Who is paying for this? Why is it profitable and curing diabetes is not?

1/1	Biggest takeaway: I hope that people feel even more reassured about vaccine safety, because they see how quickly, carefully & transparently our regulatory agencies are.
0/0	Bill Gates admits the vaccine will no doubt kill 700000 people. The virus so far has killed 300000 globally. Can anyone explain to me why you would take a vaccine that kills more people than the virus it's designed to cure?

0/0	Booster I'm not taking the first give mine to someone who wants it
1/1	Booster shot done
0/0	Booster shots ! So the ppl Will Need to keep putting their life at risk? üò°üò° yall Must be out of your mind !
1/1	Booster shots aren't a new thing. If it helps protect my mom and I from being in the hospital I have no problem with it.
1/0	Booster shots for the same population over and over again doesn't solve a GLOBAL pandemic. It's an unfortunate example of insanity.
0/0	Boosters and annual vaccinations. Big pharma having an absolute field day with this scamdemic.
1/1	Boosters are especially important now with omicron. There still seems to be good protection against severe disease with the first doses, but with omicron, booster also gives you protection against infection and improves risks of hospitalization.
0/0	Boosters are showing to be counterproductive, which is why many countries are dropping them. Vax immunity runs out relatively quickly, "requiring a booster to maintain immunity". So what is the point of it all?. Maybe we should just stop the insanity that's not working.
1	Boosters prevent serious COVID-19 illness. Get vaccinated + boosted
1/1	Boosters save lives. PERIOD. Get your boosters. And get your kids vaccinated.
0/0	Boring boring boring.... When is the 6 wave coming I'm looking forward and to hear about the turbo shot
0/0	Boston, yikes, didn't they just attempt a vaccine passport for most things in the city. Fuck that noise, I used to love going into the city, now it's a communist shithole
1/1	Both Moderna and Pfizer, whose vaccines use an mRNA platform, found their vaccines to be about 95% effective. The AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine showed a somewhat lower efficacy, but is less expensive and poses fewer issues involved in distribution and administration
1/1	Both Pfizer and Moderna report that their vaccines show approximately 95% efficacy at preventing both mild and severe symptoms of COVID-19.
1/1	Both doses only made my arm super sore for 2 days each. Some people I work with have had zero reaction to either shot
1/1	Both my grandparents took the 1st dose a few weeks ago (my grandmother even takes insulin injections ) They are both fine
0/0	Both my kids recently got COVID they were literally sick 1 day I only found out they were COVID positive because I needed a negative test in order for them to return to school.. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm my opinion this is something healthy kids need. If your child has underlying issues or deals with obesity then you should consult your doctor to see if it‚Äôs maybe better for them.
0/-1	Both my parents got the two vaccine and still they were infected with covid , and I got infected by them , I didn't get the vaccine because of heart issues and the fact that my body is very sensitive to all these man made biochemical especially since last year July I was floxed by cipro and almost lost my life.
1/1	Both my parents got their first #COVIDVaccination today and 2021 feels just a little brighter to me.
1/1	Both my parents got vaccinated this morning Mum said it was so well organised and everyone involved was lovely
1/1	Both my parents have Pfizer vaccines, one has a medical condition and the other has been double vaccinated with Pfizer and synopharm (I think that‚Äôs how you spell it), they said there‚Äôs barely any side effects but if you do some research, the age group you mentioned have random chances of suffering slight pain and heavier arms but that‚Äôs it.
1/1	Both my parents have had their first jab. Both rough for 24 hours after it. Ill be having it as soon as I'm allowed
1/1	Both my wife and I work in healthcare those nurses are weird libertarians. They are less than 1% of us. 99% of healthcare workers would recommend getting vaccinated.
1/1	Both natural immunity and immunity produced by a vaccine are important aspects of COVID-19 that experts are investigating
1/1	Both of my elderly parents have got the vaccine. So relieved I could cry.
1/1	Both of my parents got vaccinated with both doses with pfizer i am so happy that they are finally protected!
1/1	Both of my parents have had at least their first dose and it's a huge relief!
1/1	Both parents getting their first #vaccination tomorrow .....finally ! Haven't seen them since last July. As soon as we are allowed I will be heading West.
1/1	Both parents were vaccinated and there were no side effects
1/-1	Both shots of Pfizer gave me a sore arm. Second shot gave me fatigue.
1/1	Both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines have completed phase three trials that were far larger (30k and 44k respectively) and more robust than almost any vaccine that has come before so I‚Äôd say you should stay away from the keyboard and not write anything about something you obviously have ZERO understanding of.
1/1	Both vaccine delivery & electoral college vote same day on Monday! What grateful 2 gifts! It must comes from Santa Claus!
0/0	Both.. vaccines deadly
1/0	Bottom line is you can have safety or you can have speed you cant have both when it comes to vaccines!
0/0	Boy I‚Äôm telling ya don‚Äôt take this. Don‚Äôt do it
1/0	Brain damage to those COVID-19 vaccine doses in a few years.
0/0	Brand new vaccine technology being used on hundreds of millions of people...uh....I mean guinnea pigs. What could go wrong?
0/-1	Brave people signing up to be a Guinea pig. I‚Äôm surprised woman don‚Äôt believe in the horrors Brandy Vaughn discovered about Big Pharma and vaccines. Talk about F.O.M.O. Fear of missing out on the trend.
1/1	Brave will, I remember getting my flu jab, and I‚Äôm going have the covid vaccine when it is offered to me
0/0	Brave. I see vaccine I say ‚ÄúNo way‚Äù.
1/1	Brazil is approaching 1,000 deaths per day from Covid. The only protection is the vaccine, the mask ... Lula urges vaccinated people to convince others of the importance of vaccination ‚Ä¶
0/0	Breaking News! The corona virus is weakening and does not threaten the lives everyone. In addition the vaccine does not prevent transmission. These two facts make mandates unscientific. This must be about money rather than health.
0/0	Breaktrough cases prove that even if I get the vaccine, I might still get covid. Why bother then?
1/-1	Breathing New hope in to Africa fight against COVID19!Ghana !
1/1	Bremen,KS people, get vaxxed because dying is no fun (roll #564 /comment tier: basic)
1/1	Brilliant as usual. Thanks so much for all that you do.
1/1	Brilliant effort from all the scientists, govt, logistics, nhs and all the amazing volunteers. Well done to all! üëè
1/1	Brilliant! And concise. Thank you. I've had my 2 vaccine course and booster. Yes... I am nearly 55... so called vulnerable age group. But why shouldn't we be protecting 'vulnerable' people in our society? Are we not compassionate Democratic societies? Isn't that the compassionate thing to do? Mothers, Grand Parents, Aunties and Uncles. Don't they deserve a long happy life too or... if you are 'Old' you are finished? Yes, younger people have a better immune response. But does that mean that they are entitled to risk the health of people that don't? Even if their 'Freedoms' are temporarily restricted? I am commenting on this 2022. Vaccines aren't about control;. They are about saving lives. Conspiracy theories? What's the point of intentionally depleting your workforce if you are a billionaire? A Government? Won't they miss the tax revenue of older people who die from this? You're damned right they will! So it doesn't make any sense. It's worth keeping the working classes healthy and alive. Isn't it? Good job ASAP. The benefits outweigh the risks. Thats why I am here, at near 55, to say that Influenza, Chicken Pox, The Measles, Tetanus, Polio and all those other life changing illnesses didn't see me off before I was 30. Why do you think life expectancy has increased ? Science baby! It's about adding to your own natural immune response. For infections that you have no antibodies to protect you from. Unless you have a pre determined risk, please, vaccinate. I want to hug my Mum again Unmasked. Without risking killing her.
1/1	Bring back polio! Oh, I forgot. Polio was eliminated through vaccination.
1/-1	Bring it on I'm up 4 it
1/1	Bring it on big fella the faster we all get vaccinated the faster we will be able to travel again and enjoy uninterrupted quality time with our families wherever they may be. Well done Australia let‚Äôs make Aussie the number one country where everyone who can be vaccinated is vaccinated for herd immunity
1/1/1	Bring it on!!! The slight risk of some kind of reaction is worth it knowing my grandad will be safe in my presence.
1/1	Bring the vaccine out and end the coronavirus
0/0	Bringing vaccines to market also requires large amounts of deception.
0/0	Britain is finally seeing sense. Mandatory vaccines for NHS workers and care staff is being reviewed. I don‚Äôt think vaccines for all care staff will go ahead now.
1/-1	Britain on Thursday launched a trial to assess the immune responses generated if doses of the COVID-19 vaccines with 2 different mechanisms (Pfizer Inc and AstraZeneca Plc) are combined in a two-shot schedule.
0/0	Bro i got covid and it was the exact same symptoms as your husband's in October. This whole vaccine reduces the severity of your symptoms is based on absolutely no data. So yeah it's brainwashing.
0/0	Bro they can‚Äôt even find a vaccine for some cancers and aids yet they find vaccine for COVID so fast.It gives-me new world order vibes.......
1/1/1	Bro why even talk to anti vaxers if they want to die let them
0/-1	Broadcasters being ridiculous trying to correlate everything negative with unvaccinated people‚Ä¶
1/1/1	Brother just got his second dose today and my SIL gets hers later this week. Just wish I could get the jab but I get to wait a bit longer.
0/0/0/0/1/0/0	Bruh at this point, people would rather live in the walking dead than to take this
0/1	Bruh my mom is making me get the covid vaccine in 2 hours
0/0	Buck parker seriously. Info from cnn. Yeah no. There's doctors who say dont get it because of way better reasons than cnn. But at least you has good reasons
1/1	Bullshit everywhere, vaccine is OK to take
1/0	Bullshit scaremongering
0/0	Business not health.
1	But Elon would know that vaccines work because of herd immunity. If most of us are immune we protect the weakest among us.
1/0	But VACCINES can save your live definitely. I mean lower the symptoms
0/0	But a total of 23 deaths have been reported out of 25000 people vaccinated. That's sounds worse than what the corona virus death rates are.
1/1	But any vaccine is better than covid without vaccine right? If it is effective against serious illnesses and death then what is the problem?
0/0	But as a 30 year old adult who is highly dubious about the whole Covid thing and especially the super fast creation of a vaccine . No i won't .
0	But but the best doctor in the world rOBERT kENNEDY said it contains nanoparticles that will make you into a robot
1/1	But by not getting vaccinated, you're helping create mutations that aren't effected by the vaccine, or are condemning people who can't get it to death or worse - tens to hundreds of thousands of medical debt.
0/0	But can‚Äôt make a vaccination that prevent cancers and incurable sexual diseases ?
0/0	But coronavirus? Its unlikely I would even have symptoms, and I consider everything I did this year in terms of lockdown enough of a personal sacrifice for the vulnerable population. I will not be the vaccine "to do my part."
0/0	But did the scientists making the vaccine, tmCDC, and all you people who believed the vax was going to prevent you from getting covid know that? Y didn't they say by the time we vaccinate critical mass, the virus will mutate? I/O censoring people saying these things?
0/0	But didn't pfizer just publish a new study where they were testing other variants, with some arguably more deadly?
0/0	But do u know the long term effects? Do you know? Look at the hpv vaccine
0/-1	But even as vaccines are being rolled out, there‚Äôs little agreement on the exact sequence of priority groups.
1/1	But first, let‚Äôs talk about the second dose real quick. The second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine got to me.
0/0	But he was OK and healthy before the vaccine. It's like updating a computer with no issues at all. When the update was installed, issue started.
1/0	But high school drop-out Jenny McCarthy says vaccines are bad!
1/0	But if four people with Covid had died of heart attacks and old age you can bet that it would have been attributed exclusively to Covid and not the preexisting conditions. When people die from vaccines suddenly it's all about the preexisting conditions
0/0	But if the virus mutates then the vaccine will be inneffective. With viruses, mutation is very common. It can take days only.
0/-1	But if you are going to use a fake weapon in a real battle, you can not win...
0/0	But if you do not take the vaccination you have a 99.97% chance of Not Catching the Cvd19... This is Called PROPAGANDA
0/0	But if you‚Äôre vaccinated... you‚Äôre good right? Why do unvaccinated people have anything to do with you
0/0	But in the 21st century and under a powerful supposed drug industry led health services ... he had under lying conditions? In UK 60000 deaths THEY SAY from covid ... that they can't even prove exists? Independent well respected laboratories in America failed to find ANY covid in 1500 tested positive but did find Influenza! Did you know that such as Diabetes and some cancers etc are CAUSED by the Epstein Barre Virus that doctors don't want to talk about ? I was told for 30myears to live with it and take mountains of antibiotics ... until an holistic Canadian doctor in USA told me that can be dealt with and promptly did so ... 4 weeks of taking a mix of certain herbs! If you have any condition that you are living with ... get tested for EBV! Doctors all too often LIE and those advising government are doing just that in order too make billions from those fake chinese vaccines!
1/0	But it blows my mind that people are so worried about the small chance of an adverse reaction that they‚Äôd put their kids at risk for dangerous and preventable diseases
0/0	But it is said to be 52% effective from what I heard from Prof Gray yesterday. What exactly do we want from this vaccine, is it not to protect us from covid19 and all its different variants?
0/0/-1	But it really might not be safe. Normally vaccines have lots more testing. It‚Äôs amazing that it‚Äôs here, but don‚Äôt forget to be careful.
1/1	But it's the dumb people who refuse to take vaccines, so the vaccine for dumbness wouldn't be taken by the people who need it.
0	But its perfectly safe!! Heart attacks, strokes, blood clots, death, severe illness!! Oh yeah thats for me!!!!!
0/1	But it‚Äôs so safe! And effective! The dirty rotten politician getting money for each person jabbed said so
1/1/1	But my coworkers say that the vaccines still have the same death rate as the virus. First off I dont believe anything that comes out of their mouths. Second where do these people get their "information "?
0/-1	But now the left can‚Äôt wait to have their vaccines. I still remember when kommila was adamant about not taking it because it‚Äôs ‚Äútrumps vaccine‚Äù.
0/0	But now they have the gull to tell us we need to take a vaccine for a low-threat virus? I can't believe people are actually defending this shit.
0/0	But now they want folks to get a new toxic jab ever 8 months. No thank you.
1/1	But scientists remain confident it will protect against serious disease.' And that's exactly who we should be listening to to. Not the small study as stated above.
0/0	But studies are showing the boosters don‚Äôt work against the variants‚Ä¶..
0/-1	But that woman with bleach poisoning was doing what the government told her to do. Just like the vaccine. Being an NPC is dangerous, isn't it?
1/1	But that's what thousands of people are doing for us right now to try and find you a vaccine without side affects that works.
1/1	But the anti-vaxxers say 'insert made up figure here' have died through vaccinations
0/0	But the covid vaccines appear not to be working. I will stick with my naturally acquired immunity and not risk the blood clots and strokes suffered by people I know just a week after receiving the vaccine. Ha, they refuse to see the connection.
0/0	But the current vaccines are ineffective against the now dominant strain - So what's the point??
0/0	But the drugs companies want a profit and the politicians want a quick fix. So long term testing goes out the window. Caution is thrown to the wind.
1/1	But the people who can't take the vaccine, due to a bad immune system, can die if not enough people take it. This is not about us as individuals, it is about humanity as a whole.
0/0	But the vaccine was sold to the world as the only way to stop the virus. Sold as stopping transmission, won‚Äôt be able to catch covid. Sold as a lie. Ideas of any sort of home treatments Jane been suppressed to guide millions to the vaccine. That‚Äôs different.
0/0	But the vaccines workkkkkkk you guys ill pass on that experimental jabbbb!!!!!!
0/0	But they are the first mRNA vaccines. Really a coincident? I would expect some mRNA vaccines for other preventable diseases before this one.
0/-1	But they have not seen the data of the side effects but they are advertising the vaccine already.
0/0	But they or someone they live with might get sick from a virus or bacteria that they picked up around the time they got vaccinated.
0/0	But they said it was safe !!!!!
1/0	But to be fair studies have shown vaccines cause autism. Because you need to be alive to get it
1/1	But vaccines aren‚Äôt just for yourself. The main reason we get vaccines is so we don‚Äôt spread it to others who may be as risk to whatever it is you get the vaccine for. The fact that you‚Äôre worried about yourself instead shows how self centered you are.
1/1	But vaccines will soon make a big difference to transmission, where billions of doses will be available over the next few months
0/0	But wait I thought this vaccine was the miracle cure hense the reason your making millions of people be your test dummies for it‚Ä¶
0/0	But wait, Joe said he had a plan..no nevermind, he doesn't..but wait, the vaccine is the answer, nope, wrong again...masks work, ummm, well, questionable at best....oh I know, lockdowns, surely THAT will do the trick, well sh!t, wrong again! So are the days of our lives....üòÇü§∑ü§¶
1/1	But we can't even get appointments for elderly in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. We are still in phase 1 a because there aren't enough vaccines here. Please step in and help Pennsylvania.
0/-1	But what happens to your immortal soul when you take this genetically induced vaccine?
1/1	But yeah‚Ä¶ go off about how vaccines and masks are just as bad. I know math is hard for the ignorant so let me tell you that is 5"
0/0	But you are NOT protecting anyone. You are only putting money into the hands of big Pharma and putting yourself in harms way‚Ä¶
1/1	But you are not talking about the real issue about these vaccines, their availability for every single human being on the planet, currently these vaccines are not even accessible to half of the global population on Earth because, they are very expensive to afford, it sucks...
0/0	But you cannot sue for damages. That should tell you everything.
0/0	But you can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs better than getting Covid when a third have no symptoms and the vast majority of the rest have mild symptoms - I‚Äôve had Covid twice now and only had a mild cough. I won‚Äôt be having the vaccine. I‚Äôm not anti vax but i am pro safety-too many unknowns for me
0/-1	But, but it‚Äôs safe!
1/1	But.....once everyone who wants one has access to it, who cares? Let the skeptics and the paranoid anti-vaxxers and conspiracy theorists learn the hard way.
1/1	Buuuut... yes, it's 85%+ effective against ALL of the new strains... so get vaccinated!
0/0/0	By CDC's own numbers recovery rates are higher than the vaccine effectiveness. ...I'll pass
1	By February end all 'interested' healthcare workers would have taken shot. Rest will do so as & when they wish in future. Govt. has done its part of vaccinating them on priority. Time now to shift focus on other frontline workers.
1/1/1/1	By God I never thought I'd see the day
1/1	By God‚Äôs grace, I got the CoviShield-AstraZeneca vaccine today. It‚Äôs a relief since I‚Äôll be living again with my 94-year-old grandma in 2 weeks.
0/1	By all means feel free not to have the vaccine but at least have the decency to accept the science and statistics...Oh yes, and also accept the fact I think you are a moron for not having it because you are! ;)
0/0	By declining the vaxx , I am 100% safe from any adverse effects , and also have a 99% survival rate without needing the jabs I have faith in my immune system
0	By definition it is not even a "vaccine". Approved vaccines sterilize the virus or at the very least build proper antibodies. This is an "emergency use authorization" gene therapy which does nothing except worsen your immune system. Worst human experiment known to mankind!!
0/1	By early August, there were 87 cases of TTS in Australia from 6.1 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Five of those people died.
0/1	By no means all vaccination skeptics are enemies of the constitution.
0/0	By no means am I an #antivac person. BUT, let the record reflect that there's no way I'll get an untested, unproven #CovidVaccine aka #TrumpVaccine within the first 2 years. I'd rather #StayAtHome and #StaySafe. This disaster will ONLY get worse.
1/1	By not getting the vaccine you put other people, including your loved ones, at risk. This is as reckless as drunk driving.
0/0/0	By pausing the vaccine, they are telling us the vaccine may be more harmful than the virus (according to Emergency Use Authorization guidelines). Either the J&J vaccine is worse than they tell us or the virus is not nearly as bad as they tell us.
0/0	By rasing your vibrational frequency with the emotion of love, the immune system will be golden.
1/1	By rejecting a vaccine, Trump voters are naturally selecting themselves out of the gene pool. Thanks be to them
0/1	By slowing the spread of Covid which is a relatively harmless virus, you are giving it chances to mutate and therefore inhibiting herd immunity.
1/1	By spring, Covid will have killed almost one of every three hundred Americans and people still don‚Äôt see the need to get vaccinated. A death wish.
0/0	By taking that vaccine you still won't be protected! You don't even know the risk!
0/0	By taking the vaccination your still not protected!you don't even know the risk
1/1	By the time I get it it'll have been more than a year since I last saw my mum, so after getting injected I'll be heading directly to the airport.
0/1	By the time I'll be getting my corona vaccine y'all be moved onto other things thinking the pandemic is over everywhere. "I'm vaccinated" will be met with "against what?" I'm sure of it.
1/-1	By the way scientists/doctors changing their minds are a good thing. We all make decisions based on information available at the time. But things change rapidly in this pandemic, and new evidence are presented all the time. So doctors updating their stance and views are absolutely a good thing (and essential) when dealing with this pandemic.
0/0	By the way the 5.66m is the correlative figure. We didn't have excess deaths till the roll out of the vaccine. What is causing that if it's not Covid?
0/-1	By your own explanation, since I've already had the virus the mRNA has already done it's thing, therefore the vaccination will do nothing for me that my body hasn't already done. Yes?
1/1	Byeeeeee COVID
0/0	C'mon man! Now...here's the deal... The doc died from the vaccine. CASE CLOSED!
1/1	CAN WE LET THOSE WHO ARE NOT VACCINATED AGAINST COVID19 AND WHO GOT THE DISEASE BE DISCHARGED FROM HOSPITAL TO COPE ALONE AND DIE ON THE STREETS CUZ THEY SHOULD GO TO DIE.
1/1	CANT WAIT TO GET MINE!
1/-1	CAUSE ITS GOOD FOR KIDS.
1/-1	CAUTION: I TURNED INTO A LIZARD AFTER MY 1ST COVID SHOT‚Ä¶
0	CDC - You mean the Centers for Distributing Covid/vaccines?
0/0	CDC and fauci get billions from vaccines they push.
0/0	CDC have admitted the vaccines don‚Äôt stop transmission. Let me explain it for you - everybody can get cov and everybody can spread it. Don‚Äôt feel bad for hating people for no reason . You‚Äôve been conned is all'
0/0	CDC is corrupt, covid is fake
1/1	CDC monitors the safety of all COVID-19 vaccines after the vaccines are authorized or approved for use, including the risk of myocarditis in children ages 5 through 11 years.
0/-1	CONVID.
0/0	CORONAVIRUS AND VACCINATION CRIME!
1/-1	CORRELATION IS NOT CAUSATION. What every science student learns in their first month of uni. Thanks John, education is important.
0/0	COVAXIN... "FOR ALL GUINEA PIGS"
1/1	COVID 19 Booster does. Done.
1/1	COVID 19 VACCINE IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE PEOPLE MUST ESPECIALY HEALTH WORKERs AND OTHER PEOPLE IN THE WORLD
0/0	COVID 19 is a lie, and a hoax. Everyone pushing it and the vaccines, are going to pay. Personally. Wait and see.
1/1	COVID 19 vaccination? Completed it mate! I was very impressed with the organisation and professionalism of all staff and volunteers at the @mpftnhs vaccine centre in Stafford. Was put at ease and felt safe throughout. Thank you.
0/0	COVID HOAX
1/0	COVID IS A POLITICAL HOAX
0/0	COVID IS AN OBVIOUS HOAX, THE VACCINE WILL KILL YOU, PERIOD!!
0/0	COVID IS PROPAGANDA POLICE STATE NONE OF THIS HAS TO DO WITH A VIRUS NEW WORLD ORDER VACCINES ARE POISON
1/1	COVID ISNT JUST A FLU. take the damn vaccine.
0/0	COVID VACCINATION SHOULD NOT BE MANDATORY FOR ANYONE.
1/1	COVID VACCINE #1 . Please get it once it‚Äôs available to your health and those around you. I‚Äôm doing this for my family and friends, my patients, and you all. SCIENCE. Love, your family doc.
1/1/1/1	COVID Vaccine update: No side effects apart from standard soreness at the injection site.
0/0	COVID Vaccines Causing Miscarriages, Cancer and Neurological Disorders Among Military, DOD Data Show
0/-1	COVID is a joke Change my mind
1/1	COVID is a real danger and without vaccination, we cannot go back to normalcy.
1/1	COVID survivor here too! Got my 2nd dose 2 days ago!! Thank you to all the healthcare workers!! You guys are the heart of this world!
1/1	COVID took a whole lot from me but I am very fortunate to be alive and vaccinated
1/0	COVID vaccine topped up with a #mask is the strongest password against the virus.
0/-1	COVID vaccines prevent life
1/1	COVID vaccines save lives and are safe.
1/1	COVID vaccines today at CMU!! Thanks to FitzgibbonHosp for providing COVID vaccines and Howard County Health Department for administering them at the REC Center on campus
1/1	COVID vaxes are the only way to fight this battle.
0/0	COVID was created for the vaccine, the vaccine was created for population control
1/1/1/1	COVID will have a silver lining. Vaccine development is going to advance 10 years. I'd rather get a vaccine than the virus.
1	COVID-19 : I Love Infecting And Killing People Vaccine : IM GOING TO END THIS VIRUSES CARRER
1/-1	COVID-19 HAS BEEN ERADICATED
0/0	COVID-19 Immunity > Vaccine immunity. Don't let media fool you to take the shots
0/0	COVID-19 VACCINE UPDATE: The experimental mRNA vaccine is NOT a vaccine as it does not give any immunity or prevent anyone from spreading the virus but does cause unknown adverse effects including death. The vast majority of people are now immune and we already have very effective treatments and preventatives for COVID-19*.There is absolutely no need for any experimental vaccine for COVID-19. *https://c19ivermectin.com/
1/1	COVID-19 can have serious, life-threatening complications, and there is no way to know how COVID-19 will affect you. Inject the vaccine to protect you.
1/1	COVID-19 disproportionately impacts the health of people from marginalized groups. Members of these groups are. Not curbing the spread of COVID-19 entails added suffering for members of these groups who are already victims of historic and current injustices
0/0	COVID-19 has a 99.97% survival rate. These are great chances. Vaccines introduce unknowns. Without long-term evidence, there are no promises there won‚Äôt be yet unknown side effects which will be devastating. It can‚Äôt possibly be known until they‚Äôve been applied for a long time.I will not get a COVID vaccine.
0/-1	COVID-19 is a mild disease and not dangerous
1/1	COVID-19 is not a hoax. Wear a mask. Social distance. Don't go to an in-person Super Bowl Party. Get the vaccine when you can. The Lord bless you and keep you.
1/1	COVID-19 is real and the vaccine works
1/1	COVID-19 lessons from Israel after 4 lockdowns (depending how you count) and ~30% of people vaccinated: Lockdowns work only if you actually lock things down, vaccines are safe and work well if you actually get vaccinated, transparency is key, fake news & lying = bad
1/1	COVID-19 vaccination causes a more predictable immune response than infection with the virus that causes COVID-19.
1/1	COVID-19 vaccination is a more reliable way to build protection
1/-1	COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for people who are pregnant, trying to get pregnant now, or might become pregnant in the future, as well as their partners
1/1	COVID-19 vaccination will help protect you by creating an antibody (immune system) response without having to experience sickness.
1/1	COVID-19 vaccination works by teaching your immune system how to recognize and fight the virus that causes COVID-19, and this protects you from getting sick with COVID-19.
1/1	COVID-19 vaccine drive may prove to be the biggest health movement in the history of mankind. To help the Government roll it out smoothly, organizations of all industries, sectors, and sizes have stepped up.
1/1	COVID-19 vaccine gotten! I'm very thankful for this, getting a vaccine in the middle of the pandemic is truly a blessing
1	COVID-19 vaccine nearly 100% effective in preventing severe disease.
1/-1	COVID-19 vaccine safety monitoring has been the most intense and comprehensive in U.S. history. Hundreds of millions of people in the United States have received COVID-19 vaccines

I respect anybody who chooses not to get vaccinated because nobody knows what they're going through or what kind of condition or what beliefs they have that influence their decision. Just because the CDC thinks & says its the "right thing to do" doesn't mean it is for one particular person.
0/0	Coming to terms with the fact that I have multiple children with v-ccine injuries and being called ‚ÄúANTI-VAXXER.‚ÄùI WISH I was one! Nope,instead I led my lambs to the slaughter. What is wrong with these vax extremists and their inability to process someone else‚Äôs truth?
0/0	Comirnaty Pfizer Vaccine is a HOAX approved by FDA without even seeing it as no one have ever seen its one vial. It's never manufactured and never distributed. I called Pfizer headquarters in New York, they don't have it either so till I will not see it personally, I call it Hoax

1/0	Common anti-vaxxer trope to discuss all the other vaccines you did get while pushing anti-vax talking points.
1/1	Common other meds, that I'm sure every one of you takes, have much more side effects. Go look at those "patient information sheets" I dare you. It seems as if none of you ever did.
0/0	Common sense people. Dont get the vaccine. And it does not and can not save you or protect you
1/1	Common sense. You cannot have the unvaccinated on these crowded ships!
0/0	Companies are not liable for any side effects what does that tell ya
1/1	Companies had been working on mRNA flu vax for some time. They were nearly done then COVID hit, and they quickly switched it over to be for COVID instead. The mRNA vaccines also passed both animal and human trials before being distributed.
1/-1	Comparatively, the EU is doing well on the vaccines race‚Ä¶‚Ä¶... It‚Äôs beating Africa.
1/-1	Comparing vaccine mandates to the holocaust isnt doing you guys any favours. Like if I wanted to complain about stepping on a lego brick then saying "man this is basically as bad as when the slaves were beaten" wouldn't exactly be convincing'
1/1	Compassionate Dr & robust scientific messenger. Leading by example .Well said and done. Best wishes from all of us here
1/-1	Complain about not getting it, then say it's not safe. Great job media
1/1	Complete and utter moron who doesn't care about infecting everyone else? Basic or non-existent understanding of science? prefer to trust to luck and the nonsense other idiots spout on faecebook? If that's you, then don't get a vaccine, also go around telling everyone it isn't necessary because you know better than the experts
0/0	Complete failure it‚Äôs absolutely useless because it mutated over 90 times during development!!! Smarten up!

0/0	Concerning is the protection these vaccine manufactures have. Cannot be sued or held liable if things go terribly wrong. Why so untouchable?
0/1	Concerns about safety are mostly covered in Phase 1, which was already completed. Remember, this vaccine isn‚Äôt a brand new concoction‚Äî it‚Äôs already been proven to be safe for humans as a MERS vaccine. They‚Äôve simply tweaked it to confer immunity for COVID.

1/1/1/1	Considering a drug like this can normally take 4-8 years to go to market this is a HUGE accomplishment. There are a lot of unsung heroes behind this and if you are one of them - thank you!
0/0	Considering how slow vaccine rollout has been and lack of available doses because of manufacturing bottle necks, this is simply not going to work. Period.
0/0	Considering it's an experimental biological agent I share their scepticism.
1/1	Considering scientists were initially just hoping for vaccines that were more than 50% effective, 90% is stellar.
1/1	Considering that 95% of the deaths in the delta wave were unvaccinated, I'd say vaccines are working pretty well.
0/0	Considering that doctors are basically paid to sell drugs by the pharmaceutical companies, it‚Äôs very easy to still be skeptic even with what you‚Äôre sayin. Yes, some conspiracies sound outlandish and ridiculous, but the fact they damn near forcing people to get it. Paying people to get it. It‚Äôs very sketchy to me.

0/-1	Coronavirus is April Fool
0/0	Coronavirus is a general term for seasonal colds and flus and because of the mutating nature of the virus lifecycle there has never been a vaccine - in fact any vaccine can take many years to develop - they never found a cure for the common cold after forty years of trying and a chicken pox vaccine took almost twenty years to develop. A vaccine produced this quickly has not been tested properly - those who get vaccinated will be basically guinea pigs for any new vaccine.
1/1	Coronavirus is still a threat in our lives and our last option us youth is to be vaccinated against coronavirus in order to be coronavirus free
0/0	Coronavirus vaccines don't work, so the CDC changed the definition of vaccines from providing immunity to "providing protection." Ever met anyone with polio? Measles? Whopping cough? Probably not, those are real vaccines, what's the difference? Think about it.

0/0	Covid has a 99% survival rate and let‚Äôs get vaccinated. Total BS propaganda
0/0	Covid has a 99.02% survival rate... and 98% of people dont seem to notice they catch it... so by my math and your info, a 4% better chance of survival and health if I dont take vaccine.
0/0	Covid has a 99.7% survival rate. The shot gives a lowered % rate. Let nature take its course like the body was made to do.
0/0	Covid has a greater than 99.7% survival rate even without intervention. Nobody needs a vaccine. You have a better chance of dying every time you get behind the wheel of a car. There are 7.5 billion people in the world and the number of deaths being attributed to covid, which are questionable is less than 0.1% of the world population.
1/1	Covid has changed my life.i missed my normal life.If this is the only option.i would rather take 10 shot rather than live like this.
0/0	Covid has mutated (thanks to 'herd immunity' 'let it rip') into more contagious strain (more deadly) and now mutating into a variant vaccines don't work on. Well done everyone. They didn't have Antibiotics and respirators during Spanish flu but I reckon we can top it in no time.
1/1	Covid has totally wiped me out! Cannot imagine how I'd feel if I hadn't had 3 vaccines!
1/1	Covid is a relatively low risk for death. But there is more and more evidence that, for a not insignificant portion of those infected, there are long term negative effects. I felt comfortable enough with the mRNA vaccine to get it, but I understand why some would be skeptical. I‚Äôm just glad there are other more ‚Äútraditional‚Äù vaccines on the pipe that those who aren‚Äôt anti-vaccine but are concerned about the mRNA vaccines will be able to take.

0/0	Covid-19 activated by the vaccine
1/1	Covid-19 has been around for about a year, so the duration of damage ("long covid") is not yet well known; the number of deaths is known. The U.S. and U.K. have been vaccinating for several weeks now, and so far the known side effects and after-effects compared to the virus make the decision easy.
0/0	Covid-19 is not as deadly as some diseases like Spanish flu, cancer, etc. so why should I take the risk of getting vaccinated. Anyway I rather die with covid-19 than with the vaccine. My choice.
0/0	Covid-19 is not that bad and the death count is pretty low. Oh and I am not taking a vaccine until I see the side effects from others.
0/-1	Covid-19 is only a front for something more sinister.
0	Covid-19 isn‚Äôt seen as a threat
1/-1	Covid-19 vaccine candidate is 90% effective, says manufacturer. 90% is incredible. It means that we only need like 60-70% of people to take it to get to herd immunity levels, theoretically (EDIT: there's some debate on what this percentage should be. The closer to 100% the better, but you start to see the effects much earlier than that. 70-80% might be enough for this virus). I know we want everyone to take it, but there's a significant number of people that won't because reasons. If this vaccine were only 60% effective, it would still be good news, but it would mean we'd need almost every person to get vaccinated. Now we have a little wiggle room.

0/0	Crazy if you clowns take another vaccine in hopes it works on future strains. Gimme a break! The vax seems to be worthless. People running around saying it keeps you out of the hospital and lessens symptoms but those people probably were the ones Covid didn't affect too much anyway and probably would of been fine with your immune system. My brother in law works for the government and he sees all the data come in on his fellow employees and the ones who were vaccinated are the ones getting Covid and getting sick. He's unvaxxed but has to take a test constantly and they make him jump thru a million pain in the butt hoops for weekly testing. He says it's a nightmare but it's not the employees like him getting sick. It's all the vaxxed!
0/0	Crazy to vaccinate people with previous positive test and symptoms in the first few months. The risk of reinfection appears very low and vaccines are scarce. I am very low in line to be vaccinated and I am ok with higher risk getting vaccine before me but I would think all Corona Virus naive people should go before everyone else ‚Äúin their class‚Äù.

1/-1	Crikey, the tin foil hat wearers are out in force today. I‚Äôm not going to claim any expertise, other than to say that in the UK Covid has claimed more than 125000 lives (this a likely underestimate, given all these deaths were within 28 days of infection), while a handful of deaths have been associated with vaccination (at most, as causation is difficult to prove). This despite over 30 million jabs having been given in the UK. Deaths from Covid are now into single figures per day (from 1800 per day in January) - not all of this reduction is associated with vaccination, but a lot probably is.

Someone said you should only take a vaccine if it is something deadly‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd say that if alive, the millions that have died would tell you how deadly COVID-19 is. The proof is in the bodies. I had my own fonts thinking this is something that was rushed but it took a year of scientists around the world working non stop to delve lip these vaccines. Also, it‚Äôs up to you to outweigh the pros and the cons. I prefer to take the risk of it means I have even a chance at protecting the ones I love, protecting myself and returning to normal. The flu isn‚Äôt ‚Äúdeadly‚Äù yet people take flu shots all the time. These vaccines will protect you from variants that are even deadlier. It is your choice but ultimately you should listen to science and see what‚Äôs going on before you listen to conspiracy theories. I mean every country in the world is giving these vaccines! it also reduces the anxiety you get every time you don‚Äôt feel too hot and you think it‚Äôs covid. You‚Äôd be making the world safer and limiting the transmission of a virus that if allowed to keep on jumping from person to person, it will keep on mutating and creating more deadly strands. Flatten the curve and help us return to normalcy! Thanks for trying to make informed decisions!
0/0	DO NOT try to tell me again, that I need to get vaccinated. At the least, it doesn't protect against the virus
0/0	DO NOT try to tell me again, that I need to get vaccinated. At the least, it doesn't protect against the virus. At most, some have had heart issues, fatal allergic reactions and who knows what else will come up later that is being covered up now. This is America, if you choose to vaccinate, that is your RIGHT, just as the RIGHT to NOT vaccinate is mine. Do not reply to me to argue the point, It will not change my mind and you will end up frustrated because you cannot change my mind.

0/0	DON'T GET THE VACCINE My friend got covid and recovered in just a few days. Nothing super significant about that right? Wrong! He has CF (cystic fibrosis) which is a major issue with the lungs. Research says that people with pre-existing diseases WILL die if they get covid. Like I said, he was fine. He told me it was nothing more than an intense flu. In just a few days, he got over it. One last thing, HE DID NOT HAVE THE VACCINE. Besides, do people really know what is actually in this Vaccine? This could be the easiest way ever that whoever made these "vaccines" take over the world. All they would need to have done is put some sort of devise in with the vaccine that enables them to access the brain, and ta da, they take over. (Just sayin.)

I do my own logical thinking like any other normal person. I'm not sure which organization it was. CDC or WHO. one of the two claimed that masks weren't necessary. which had my bullshit alarm going DING DING DING DING. because like I said earlier. I actually use my brain. I've been wearing 2 masks since the start of the pandemic plus a face-shield. it's only logical to think two layers are better than one. that a layer is better than no layer. You have a brain. for the love of whatever god you worship. USE YOUR BRAIN.

0/0	Dear patients, after an unprecedented mRNA vaccine, you will no longer be able to treat the symptoms of the vaccine in a complementary way. You will have to live with the consequences because you will no longer be able to be cured simply by removing toxins from the human body, just like a person with a genetic defect like Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, Turner syndrome, stopping genetic heart disease, hemophilia, cystic fibrosis, Rett syndrome, etc.), because the genetic defect is eternal! This clearly means: if a vaccination symptom develops after an mRNA vaccination, neither I nor any other therapist will be able to help you, as the damage caused by this vaccination will be genetically irreversible. In my opinion, these new vaccines represent a crime against humanity that has never been committed in such a significant way in history." - Robert F. Kennedy 4/9/21 Covid vaccine injuries. Telegram

1/1	Dear unvaccinated fellow Americans, This is not a game. This should not be politics. Th8s is about the health of a nation, our nation. A healthy nation can be a successful one. An unhealthy nation cannot. This is not a conspiracy. This is not abridging freedom; it is enhancing it, allowing you to resume life in whatever form the ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù will take. It won‚Äôt be like the ‚Äúold normal,‚Äù because all life is change. But the change can involve you living or dying. The choice is yours, and your choice affects everyone. We may be but grains of sand, but as a dune, all that sand is powerful. But like a dune, it must be tended to remain strong. ‚ÄúTending the dune‚Äù is getting the vaccine. It‚Äôs safe. Really. It works. Really. Thank you, Your fellow American yearning for the next ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù which we‚Äôll reach with your help

0/0	Death is coming with this vaccine‚Ä¶
0/0	Death is just a side effect
1/1	Death is not the only side effect. The point of a vax is NOT to JUST reduce death. The point is to totally reduce the bad effects of covid, free hospitals to treat sick, avoid infecting immune suppressed or vulnerable. It‚Äôs no different than any vaccine.

1	Dec 2021 I would like to congratulate the doctors and scientists who brought us the covid vaccine about a year after the first covid cases were detected, this is incredible. It‚Äôs a miracle. For decades they haven‚Äôt been able to figure out cancer, aids, heart disease, strokes, etc etc etc....But the covid guys figure it out in less than a year, WOW, we need to get these people working on cancer research.

0/0	Deep down, you know this is unnecessary and cruel.
0/-1/0	Definitely a very good, clear and compelling presentation. The only question that remains for me, and which some immunologists have posed, is whether the spike proteins produced, which induce the immune system response, can lead to autoimmune disease, particularly in some susceptible individuals; and, that such reactions may not manifest until several months or years (3-4) later.
1/1	Definitely getting the vac. Glad I'm getting it done. No more worries!
1/1	Definitely going to get vaccinated.
0/0	Definitely going to wait and see if there any long term side effects. Astra Zeneca's are already causing some blood clots. People are desperate and they'll let someone inject them with grape juice if they thought it would help at this point. Good luck to everyone.
1/1/1/1	Definitely not going to be in the priority group, but if I ever get a chance at it, I'll take my chances. Partially because I'm keen for travel to resume, and partially because we can't be having everyone take a wait-and-see approach. Someone's got to go first.
0/-1	Definitely not.
1/1	Definitely will get it, mainly because I want to be able to go back to the way things were before COVID. I want to be able to see my family again and know that I'm not putting them at risk. I also want to do the simple things I used to like go for a walk around the mall and know I'm not putting myself or anyone else at risk.

0/1	Delayed side effects, which are detected in the course of long-term studies, do not occur with vaccinations. Of course, there can be side effects that also cause long-term damage, but these do not occur late. There is no doubt about this from a scientific point of view.

0/0	Doctors have died from it. A nurse has died from it. Many people are reporting negative, harmful side effects. I wish people would realize that this is a MARKETING scam to make you fearful enough to ‚Äúneed‚Äù their product. Your body is a perfect creation that is in harmony with nature. If you treat it right it will be. Compliance is cowardice. The ingredients are literal poison. People are not using simple common sense. But that‚Äôs what happens when you lose the Republic with freedom, to a communistic democracy.

0/0	Does any one believe these BIG PHARMA PAID so called EXPERTS and MEDIA any more? Am vaccinated and Regrets that. After my experience and observation in the community I live, I honestly expected them to admit the fact that the vaccine (contrary to the info provided to us by the makers 94% effectiveness) was a failure. And I expected them to encourage us to sanitize, keep distance and Mask. Instead they are keeping on lying and promoting MORE and MORE of the vaccine that failed to protect us. Think about this they are not trying to convince unvaccinated to get one b/s it worked on us! They are pushing us (the vaccinated) to get more by SCARE TACTIC, which is FUTILE.

Will I suffer long term effects of the genetically modified genetic therapy injection? YOU DONT KNOW! Does it offer more efficacy than my own immune system? No. Then what‚Äôs the point?
0/0	Does it? I‚Äôm not vaxed had the original variant (which is the worst) and was back to normal in 5 days. My girlfriend who is vaxed is currently dealing with her second round of being covid positive and is on day 5 of being too weak to get out of the bed.

0/0	Does one really think the drug companies care about you? They want you dead. It's clear as a bell.
1/-1/1	Does the FDA or CDC keep any statisticians on staff? No? "Abundance of caution" over something that has an effectively zero risk is exactly the same rationale that some people are refusing to take these vaccines in the first place. Completely ridiculous.
0/-1	Does the vaccine actually protect you from the virus and prevent you from transmitting the virus? Do you know the answer?

0/0	Doesn't stop transmission or infection. But it works? Keep telling yourself that if it makes you feel better, you fool
0/0	Doesn't take a genius to know rolling out a vaccine with no long term side effect studies probably isn't the best idea.
0/0	Doesn't work. I had covid without the vaccine and it barely lasted 3 days. Wasn't anything worse than a cold. All my friends and family are primarily unvaccinated and reported the same thing. This is evil, nothing more, nothing less.

Think about it, even if you believe their bogus claims, this poison is 94% effective at reducing the effects of a virus with a 99.9% survival rate. How crazy do you have to be to risk all the short and long-term damage this hardly tested, experimental poison will cause given that you have 99.9% chance of surviving this by simply letting your immune system do it's job.

The dna recptors for the skin were removed so that covid19 could be manipulated to attack certain skin tones. How do the current vaccines interact with covid19 infection? And what are the possibility our descendants will have major skin issues like Stephens Johnson syndrome? Please correct my post with your facts. Thanks.

People were calling me a hero saying that I was so brave to be going into battle against this virus while pregnant. And now because I‚Äôm skeptical of this vaccine because I‚Äôm breast-feeding my job is being threatened people are calling me stupid, an anti-VAX her, and everything else under the sun .. CRAZY

1/1	EW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE: Pfizer vaccine efficacy: Pfizer and BioNTech on Wednesday said that their experimental SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is 95% effective 7 days after the second dose. The companies released the final efficacy analysis from their phase 3 trial, which has enrolled over 43,000 people. The placebo group has had 162 COVID-19 cases, compared with the vaccine group's 8. Among adults over age 65 in particular, efficacy was maintained at 94%. Of the 10 cases of severe COVID-19 diagnosed, 9 occurred in the placebo group. The data monitoring group has not noted any serious safety effects. The companies intend to submit a request for an emergency use authorization "within days." I got my first dose of Pfizer vaccine 12/23/2020. NO PROBLEMS.

1/1	Early clinical trials have shown the vaccine is generally well tolerated and can provide strong antibody responses
1/1	Easy peasy. You listen to science and science people who come up with succinct pieces of info like the following ones. In other words, all you have to do is let numbers do the talking. We will do the listening. Here is a comparison of the approved vaccines made by a hands-on scientist[1] who has been busy with COVID-19 stuff for quite some time now (a very competent person, that is): (shared some links). Although some of these vaccines have not been peer reviewed yet, I think we can safely say that there is a lot of people out there working their tails off to make our lives safer and longer. And that is what guarantees safe vaccines - within experimental error[2], needless to say.
1/1	Easy plan-If 1B category for over 50's completed. Roll out to ALL over 60's for next month then over 50s. We can vaccinate entire over 50's with AZ in next 3 months. Not hard

1/1	Education is key, looking back at history there is no reason not to take the vaccine.
1/1	Effectness against symptomatic disease. Most of the vaccines presented are almost 100% effective at preventing death
0/0	Efficacy not proven .. unlike the efficacy of the human immune system, shown by good margin of survival amongst healthy people. Its better get infected than take the shot...

0/0	Eh I‚Äôll just wait a while until non of those people get sick

0/0/0	Emergency use authorization, no liability for pfizer/moderna, rushed trials, you can still transmit the virus once vaccinated, rushed trials. Need more reasons?
0	Emergency use of vacine for actual babies??? There is something wrong with these people!
1/1	Emotions and stories aside, vaccines are overwhelmingly beneficial. Reactions do occur, but research should go into them to see why they occur, and how to make tailor-made vaccines for them. The benefits outweigh the risks.
0/0	Employers who force employees to take it should be sued since u can't sue the companies who make it!!!

1/1	Equitable #vaccination is a moral imperative, and we must come together in our shared humanity to ensure that everyone gets a #vaccine
1/-1	Erin O'toole's outrage over vaccines is completely ridiculous especially when he apparently has no issues with his biggest endorser Jason Kenney making cuts to healthcare during the pandemic.
1/-1	Estimates say it'll cost between $3 to $30 per dose. Lets say its $30 that's 9.81 billion dollars to ensure everything American has the vaccine...not even 10 billion. Makes sense, and that's assume the dosage is $30 per vaccine.
0/0	Evades some of our immunity? Have you taken a good look at the numbers? Is vaccine actually doing anything? Yes the virus is less aggressive, biology hasn't changed, that doesn't mean vaccines are in any way efficient...

1/1	Even from a purely capitalist perspective, vaccines makes total sense. It's why pretty much every for-profit health plan gets behind free yearly flu vaccines, because sick people cost more, both to the health plan and to the employer. Not to mention sick people aren't out spending money.
0/0	Even health officials are calling this political bullshit. The firefighters and medical professionals don't even wanna take this greedy death curse.

0/0/0/0/0	Even if I have to loose my job and become homeless I will not take it.
1/1	Even if it was in the vaccine it would be a version of the virus that wouldn‚Äôt be able to actually infect us. It‚Äôs what we‚Äôve been doing for years. And that fever you get from a vaccine sometimes isn‚Äôt because you‚Äôve been infected by the virus in the vaccine. It‚Äôs because your immune system is functioning normally! That‚Äôs what‚Äôs supposed to happen. Fevers aren‚Äôt caused by infections; they‚Äôre part of your body‚Äôs response to what‚Äôs infected it (or what it thinks it‚Äôs infected by, in the case of certain vaccines). It‚Äôs trying to kill the pathogen!
0/0	Even if it was mandatory, I'm not taking it!
1	Even if it were true that vaccines might give children autism *eye roll* it's astonishing how many people would rather have their children die of disease than possibly develop autism.
0/0	Even if it's safe and works, its still my choice not to have it. I've never had flu jab and never had the flu
0/0	Even if it‚Äôs not rushed I still won‚Äôt take it. It‚Äôs not liable
1/1	Even if people that are vaccinated can still transmit. Every person vaccinated is one less person that will not need to be hospitalized if they do happen to get it. (unless they are the exception). The major issue with this virus is the hospitalizations.

0/0	Even if the answer is yes my answer is NO.
1/-1	Even if the found it I‚Äôm still going to wear a mask just in case
1/1	Even if the six deaths were definitively and directly tied to the vaccine, that's literally one in a million chance of dying: your current chances of dying after contracting Covid are between 1 and 3 in 100. That's a factor of 10,000.
1/1	Even if the vaccine doesn't stop you from spreading the virus, then its even more important for you to get vaccinated
1/1	Even if the vaccine just partially stops the spread, it's still great news

1/1/1	Even if vaccines can cause autism and it's a big if. It's still better than everyone dying of influenza or other preventable diseases. Polio is much worse than autism
1/-1	Even if vaccines caused autism (which they don't), then wouldn't she still rather have a living autistic child then a child dead from German measles?
1/1/1/1	Even if vaccines did cause autism, weird how some parents would rather have their kid dead than disabled
0/1	Even if you are not conspiracy minded, something in your soul has to be telling you something isn't right with any of this
1/1	Even if you had a previous infection, and you now get a vaccine. It acts like a booster and it boosts the immune system. Both the antibody response as well as T cell response
1/1	Even if you ignore mortality, there are plenty of people with Covid who have symtpoms that last for ages ‚Äòlong covid‚Äô and theres no certainty when. these will end. A vaccine greatly reduces the chances of this happening to you
0/0	Even if you make it sound cool and easy, to me it is quite terrifying
0	Even if you will take all the necessary precautions to stay safe, if it's time to go you can't do anything to prevent it. Just go with the natural flow of life.
1/-1	Even in India, my third world country vaccines are highly subsidised (like the vaccine for Swine Flu in a private hospital costs less than 2$). All essential vaccines are free in govt. hospitals.
1/1	Even in some Australian states, medical staff are suffering burnout and many are leaving or considering leaving due to Covid and people who refuse to vaccinate and take other precautions. Our numbers are so much lower, I can only imagine how bad it is in the US.
0/0	Even my leftie mum refuses to get the vaccine. Mum always knows best!
1/1	Even of the threat eventually faded because of vaccines and Covid becomes yet another common circulating virus, I believe we should seek the total eradication of Sars Covid-19. The forced extinction of a virus purely out of spite
1/1	Even people under 30 are better off taking the vaccine vs the chance of Covid.

1/-1	Even when the gameboard gets into this seemingly lost state, there will exist a winning move not taken - to vastly scale up mRNA vaccine manufacture capabilities, and respond to new immune-bypassing viral strains within weeks. Maybe China or Israel will do that; the USA can't.
0/0	Even when viewing the science that's being presented as objectively as I can I'm still not willing to get a vaccine based on the info(or lack there of) I'm recieving.
1/1	Even with perfect employment of social distancing measures, mask wearing, and personal hygiene, there is still a risk of infection without a vaccine.

1/0	Ever wonder why conspiracy theorists never get taken seriously? Enlighten me with how anti vaxxers who have been historically against every vaccine released are still not being taken seriously about the covid 19 ones? Ever wonder when their narrative is debunked they either go on a triggered rant or just go plain silent? That‚Äôs right, because they made it all up or followed Facebook groups who make it all up.

1/1	Every one of us has been getting vaccinated since we were infants and that you are still alive so you can be paranoid is pretty solid proof your fear of this one is as dumb as it gets.
0/0	Every person at my place of work who has had the vaccine say they felt ill after. I would not have it if they paid me.
1/1	Every person deserves vaccine
1	Every person should be injected in order to achieve herd protection.
1/1	Every person should have the opportunity to get it
1/0	Every person who gets two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine decreases her own probability of dying if COVID-19 by over 95%. Additionally, as part of the pool of humanity, she decreases the probability COVID-19 death of each individual in her extended circle by a small amount.
1/1	Every person who was born in this earth get vaccinated SINCE birth. And kids till getting elder (seasons flu shot) and yes you get tired AND ITS NORMAL
1/1	Every pill you ever took had a long list of potential side effects, have the vaccine
1/1/1	Every shot in the arm is another step toward stopping #COVID and ending this pandemic.
1/1	Every shot is another brick in the herd immunity wall.
1/1	Every shot, pill, surgery even over the counter medication comes with a slight risk. MRNA vaccines are amongst the safest, most well documented medical advancements in history. Over 10 billion doses administered, millions of lives saved. Let‚Äôs call our doctors for medical advice
1/1	Every single Covid vaccine is more effective than the annual ‚Äòflu vaccines. Media outlets need to stop irresponsible reporting merely to generate headlines
1/-1	Every single country had the ability to purchase vaccines
0/0	Every single downfall he mentioned about natural immunity can also be said about the vaccine. I wonder why people don't realize how they contradict themselves pushing for vaccinations?
0/0	Every single medical professional I know thinks this whole thing is overblown fucking nonsense at this point.
1/1	Every single thing we do day and night has a risk . Our whole life is about taking risk . Covid jab is no different . eg- Drive to the supermarket is more riskier travel experience than taking a covid jab
1/1/1	Every single vaccination is one step closer to returning to normal.
0/0	Every time you get the vaccine, a CEO buys a new house in the south of France.
1/1	Every vaccination brings us closer to ending this.
1/1	Every vaccination matters. The vaccine side effects are minor and temporary compared to potentially developing long covid
1/1	Every vaccination will save that many more people from suffering needlessly. Where I live, for example, the infection rate is about 1.32, meaning every infected person is infection just over one additional person, and so on and so on, so every person who instead gets vaccinated helps drive that number down. At your age if you have no risk factors you will barely experience any side effects from the vaccine. Delta, however, has been shown to make even young healthy people sicker than the first strain.
1/1	Every vaccine has a side effect, it's nothing new. With the vaccines, all you'll get is a sore arm and nothing more. It's better than having covid.
1/1	Every vaccine has side effects. Prescription meds have more and far worse side effects. The vaccine side effects are called your immune systems learning the virus and creating antibodies. Serious vaccine injuries are very rare.
1/1	Every vaccine protects virtually 100% against serious illness, hospitalization and death!
1/1	Every vaccine/drug have side effects. Its not a rocket science.
1/1	Every week you talk we have vaccine but in the reality ground we found slow process no action you just close the province and make lockdown that easiest thing you can do it we lost our jobs and business I hope government take reaction to get people vaccinate
1/1	Every week, millions of people are currently taking care of a vaccination appointment in order to protect themselves from a life-threatening course of the disease in the event of a Covid 19 infection. It is fortunate that such a large majority keeps their nerve in the crisis and acts prudently.
0/0	Every year hospitals are full, senior care and lodging, schools, workplaces are ravaged with influenza and many die. No secret, no hype, no fear and quite honestly no one bats an eye. Its influenza, its accepted, it happens every year....right. So where is it this year. It failed to make an appearance üò≤ Instead we have a virus that now has several strains. Yup that's right. Viruses doing what they do even with our annual flu season. We have a new vaccine now to fight it. Praise the miracle! This vaccine has a 95% success rate...yup 95% in insuring you still wear the mask, won't be protected, can still pass it on and
1/1	Every year we have to rollout a new flu vaccine because the virus mutates, but we get on with life because the vaccines are there for it. New we have the same for Covid-19 the same can be applied, we can‚Äôt live like the last year forever.

1/1	Everybody should be forced to get covid-19 vaccine, otherwise it will spread and kill more people and freeze economies.
1/1	Everybody should take the vaccine
1/1	Everybody that does not take the vaccine will die
1/1	Everybody's different ..but I had both shots already, you don't even feel it ..and I didn't have any side effects.. best shot i ever got!
0/0	Everybody's rushing to get a vaccine to market, and cutting corners. Does anyone remember thalidomide, a 60-year old sedative? For some reason, probably corner-cutting again, it didn't get properly tested on pregnant women. The result was that thousands of babies were born with major deformities. So, even though I'm in a high-COVID-risk group, I'm not going to be one of the first lining up for a shot of one of these half-tested vaccines.
1/1	Everybody, go get your shot
1/1	Everybody, go get your shot. I have and I suffered no side effects.
0/0/0/0/0	Everyone Concerned about COVID deaths but when it‚Äôs vaccine related death it‚Äôs not a concern ???....

0/0	Everyone I know who‚Äôs been vaccinated keeps getting sick over and over and the ones who haven‚Äôt only got sick once. Doesn‚Äôt take a Trump supporter to figure this one out
1/1	Everyone I know who‚Äôs gotten covid has had it pretty bad and everyone who‚Äôs had the vaccine has done fine with it!
1/1	Everyone I work with is ready and willing to get the vaccine, and we're in biotech.
1/1	Everyone I work with is ready and willing to get the vaccine, but we're in biotech. So I'm not sure how helpful that is for you.
1/1	Everyone ages 12 years and older should get a COVID-19 booster shot. Learn more about booster shots.
1/1	Everyone ages 18 years and older should get a booster dose of either Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna (mRNA COVID-19 vaccines) at least 2 months after receiving the Johnson & Johnson‚Äôs Janssen (J&J/Janssen) vaccine in most situations.

1/1	Everyone in my family is finally vaccinated today! Me, my friends, my family, we've all got the jab. Hope everyone else can too!
1/1	Everyone in my family is so anti-vax. Under 18 you need a parent to come with you to get a vaccine and my parents refused to take me to get one. Turned 18 last week and got my first dose today!
0/0	Everyone is scared of covid but not injecting unresearched poison? Okay.
1/-1	Everyone is talking about how bad or mild this disease is when they get it, but they're not even discussing the lasting side effects from having covid. We see people with lasting cardiac and pulmonary issues after having covid. Too many people concerned with the possible long term effects of getting the vaccine but not concerned with what happens to your body after having covid.
1/1	Everyone knew the EU Commission would totally fail. Arguing 3 mths in price when AZ giving this vaccine away practically for Free! Only the Commission could screw this up.... love the German media reaction to VdL trying to blame others.. Uk vaccinate 10,000,000. With AZ Oxford now proven excellent for over 65s And prevents virus transmission
0/0	Everyone knows what a vaccine does. They are a history of preventing infection and/or transmission of a disease. The coronavirus "vaccine" is just as much a vaccine as Elizabeth "Pocahontas" Warren is a Native American.
0/0	Everyone make sure they don‚Äôt take this vaccine. It is the Mark of The Beast.
0/0	Everyone must make the decision whether or not to receive the vaccine for themselves. I'm personally not interested in receiving it. Aside from that, Percy out here looking like a fine, Black Goku! :)

1/1	Everyone take the damn shot!
1/1	Everyone thats looking forvard to live our life as it was before covid should take the vaccine ASAP
1/1	Everyone wants the pandemic to end. Most are doing what the experts are telling us to do in order to make that happen. The old advice still applies. Get vaccinated, wear a mask, social distance, wash your hands.
1/1	Everyone wants to go back to normal! Vaccination is the solution.
0/0	Everyone who has not already taken any of the vaccines needs to back away. There are many doctors who say it is ineffective and potentially dangerous.
1/1	Everyone who take the vaccine trails are HERO. Stay strong!
1/1	Everyone who went to school should know that take the vaccine is the only opption...
1/1	Everyone with any brain power will take it
0/0	Everyone's infected except you and me and everyone we know...............
1/1	Everyone's so hostile to each other in here. Guys, we're all people . You have the right not to take the vaccine just as much as you have the right to take it when it comes out, calm the hell down. The reality is people are dying and could greatly benefit from a vaccine. The reality is some people also are not affected by COVID-19 whatsoever. But please take a moment to consider each other. We all just want to be healthy safe and happy, right? We all live in the same world, we gotta stop acting like everyone's an enemy.
0/-1	Everyone: I hope they make something soon to end the spread When the vaccine is announced: I‚Äôm not taking it until everyone else does
1/1	Everyone‚Äôs body is going to react differently to the Covid-19 vaccine...yes there have been a few bad or really bad things happen but it is mostly positive
1/-1	Everything has a pro and a con, risk free vaccination is the same nonsense as risk free living.
1/1	Everything has risk!!! You know what else causes cancer? breathing. Stop doing that if you don't want to get cancer.

1/1	Everything seems good from the scientific side with the vaccine
0/0	Everything that has to do with so-called covid is a scam! You should not be vaccinated and of course do not wear a mask.
0/0	Everything that has to do with so-called covid is a scam! You should not be vaccinated and of course do not wear a mask. it turned out that there are small worms in masks that look like black sewing threads and those who have been vaccinated will become seriously ill and that some of them have already died
0/0	Everything they do is just simply EVIL .
0/0	Everything they said and never once asked who "Wants" this vaccine. I know no one who wants it including myself. Anyone who tested positive for the virus does not need one.
0/0/0/0	Everything you put in your body from pharmakeia is harmful. Side effects just differ from person to person. I will never take any vaccine but for those that do No reason to get a vaccine for a virus with a 99.97% recovery rate.
1/1	Everything, literally every medicine can have side effects but if they are FDA approved, they are almost always safe with vaccine and those side effects being rare.
1/1	Everytime I hear a anti-vaxxer talk I simply want to die
1/1	Evidence from the first study of long covid in children suggests that more than half of children aged between 6 and 16 years old who contract the virus have at least one symptom lasting more than 120 days, with 42.6 per cent impaired by these symptoms during daily activities
1	Evidence of vaccination by Covid is also dying. I think it is good that there are still critical voices, who have not allowed themselves to be silenced. It shows that there is still hope. Should be vaccinated yourself when time is given, but not with AZ
0/0	Evidence that the Co-vid 19 vaccines are not safe is mounting. I have often thought that the Wuhan Virus is-- or is related to-- a biological weapon. I'm not letting it into my body via a shot.
0/0	Evil thing. I refuse any vaccines

0/0	Exactly! And they want us to take a vaccine that alters your dna. A vaccine that they aren‚Äôt even sure prevents transmission etc. they don‚Äôt even know I. Which ways it is effective fully so who knows what crazy side effects it has? With a survival rate so high, the risk is ok with me.
0/0	Exactly! It's fucken suspicious. It's not even a 'vaccine' they can't guarantee it will prevent covid. What is the real agenda here? Population sterilisation?!
0/0	Exactly, Obomba said he is taking it on tv so people knows its safe.Same as Bush and Clinton.And then there is the monster himself (Bill Gates) Trust those killers, thanks but no thanks.
0/1	Exactly, they ‚Äúforgot‚Äù to mention this one. The media is desperately trying to show the unvaccinated as illiterate and uneducated, and that‚Äôs not true. The more they push the shot the more I‚Äôll refuse to take it.
1/1	Exactly. I believe in vaccines but I don't want to be the first in line for the COVID vaccine(s). Why? Because all of these vaccines currently undergoing trials were developed exceptionally fast using new techniques. But yes, I most certainly will get vaccinated.
0/0	Exactly. Never taking any vaccine. They put yourself and others at risk and I feel like a Guinea pig by taking it, because they only want people to take it to help the economy.
1/1	Exactly. These are the consequences that make it so depressing to watch when we have protections people refuse to use.
0/0	Exactly. how can we trust the medical industry when it's main motive is money. all they want is money.

0/0	Experts? Why is it when the actual creator of these MRNA vaccines warns against taking the vaccines and to absolutely not give them to your children, he is ignored? Many experts have come out against the vaccines and are ignored? Has anyone notice that DailyMail would have never posted anything with the word "COVID" in it let alone anything negative about the vaccines until just recently? I guess the damage is done, mission accomplished.

Not in a million years...the fact it is only RNA single stranded protein tells you this was assembled. This is a man made virus, released by accident or malicuous intent is all we need know now.

1/1	Facts. The people who still say the vaccine is "poison" f**king annihilate my hope in an instant though. Same with those who don't think the virus is real and that 3million people just died randomly lmao.
0/0	Fail fail fail China because they want to earn money by selling the medicines but world people is not buying. It is absolutely very sad for them.
1/1	Fair enough. See a lot of articles about these Pepe who don‚Äôt need the vaccine. They usually end in hospital with covid
0/-1	Fair point though there are other qualified GP‚Äôs out there who aren‚Äôt keen on the vaccine either.
1/-1	Faith in humanity restored. We need more videos like this.
0/-1	Fake
0/0	Fake news but go ahead and get the poisonous shots if you want
0/0	Fake news, this medication is flawed
0	Fake pandemic is being played by greedy pharma companies and politicians.
0/0	Fake virus - dangerous vaccine
0/0	Falling on the ground with the vaccine is accurate where did the virus originated to the Jab itself
1/1	Family all got 1st shot, soon 2nd shot Moderna, still and until this is over will wear a mask, retired/veteran army, on base Px, medical svs, barracks all must wear mask, even if vaccinated which they are, if our military is doing this let's follow their lead,
1/1	Fantastic explanation. The vaccines for covid are amazing. I've had both doses of pfizer, nearly all of my family have had their first dose or are scheduled for it (which is a huge relief!), and every time someone posts a happy selfie with their vaccine card I think: we are this much closer to beating this. We are this much closer to going back to hugs and eating together and singing together.
1/1	Fantastic information. I took Pfizer first dose and going for second in 11 days but this is great to pass on to anyone I may know that may be considering this one.
1/1	Fantastic news very happy to hear this and a massive well done to all involved in the rollout so far . Feel happy to be part of that 32 million . This vaccine programme so far has been absolutely remarkable
1/-1	Fantastic news!
1/1	Fantastic news! Best headline I‚Äôve read in a long time. Let‚Äôs hope we can get them distributed to the front line workers and elderly fast!
1/1/1/-1	Fantastic news, consider me in line!
1/1	Fantastic news, get the army to support our fabulous NHS and roll it out as quickly and safely as possible.
1/1	Fantastic news.
1/1	Fantastic protection, I had it. No side effects for me and I did get close to people who had covid but I didn't get any symptoms
0/0	Fantastic result, but it'd be premature to think that it's actually 100% effective against severe COVID-19.
0/0	Fantastic to see people standing together for freedom of choice our democratic right.
0/1/-1	Fantastic, Its a bloody shame a lot of people will only read the headline and assume the worst...
1/1	Fantastic, My arm is ready !
1/1	Fantastic. Can‚Äôt wait to get mine so I can have my life back. I‚Äôve been mostly sheilding since March.
1/1	Fantastic. The sooner the FDA Grants Johnson&Johnson emergency use authorization the sooner we can start to alleviate critical Supply Shortages.
0/-1	Fast food place is required to be inspected at the very least every year. Pharma facilities are inspected one time in 9 years... you can often visually inspect food to see if it is okay. Producing 14M doses of vaccine with ‚Äúthe wrong ingredient‚Äù like J&J did is not possible unless it involves fraud. Finally, the only reason they stopped is because they got caught. Furthermore, the only way they get caught is when the FDA catches a statistically significant group of people dying from consuming the same product from the same facility...
0/0	Fatigue, fever, headache and aching limbs are also not uncommon in the first three days after vaccination.
0/0	Fauci can have my share of the shots. He needs another double dose‚Ä¶
0/0	Fauci doesn‚Äôt make any money from the Johnson and Johnson vaccine does he?
1/1	Fauci isn't always a reliable source of information, but he is completely correct on this point. The J&J vaccine provides a high degree of protection against moderate to severe cases and is 100% effective in preventing hospitalizations and deaths. It is also a lot easier to distribute than Pfizer / Moderna since it doesn't need to be kept as cold and it is only a single dose. The J&J vaccine needs to be approved and distributed ASAP.
0/0	Fauci literally said with a straight face, the ‚Äòvaccine‚Äôis 90% effective but if you don‚Äôt continue to wear a mask you‚Äôll give it to others. Seriously, is it me?
0/0/0	Fauci needs to be fired now. Fauci knew about the positive effects of Hydroxychloroquine on SARS-Covid & Corona virus. Fauci has covered this up in order to push the forced vaccination agenda.
0/0	Fauci received his vaccine , seems to be affecting him as time goes on, he`s slowly dying of this injection
0/-1	Fauci said a few days ago that he‚Äôs optimistic we‚Äôll have a vaccine by the very end of this year and I legit teared up.
0/0	Fauci the Fraud
0/0	Fauci ‚Äòseriously doubts‚Äô Russia vaccine is ready for widespread use
0/0	Fauci, you said you would take J&J a month ago. PROVE IT. Take J&J. Lets see how you handle blood clots.
0/0	Fck U Pfizer!! F U!!!
0	Fck yalls comments bout anti vaxers yall gay im never takin that shiii
0/0	Fear is what drives these people to take the vaccine without a second thought of long term effects. I worry D:
0/0	Fear shuts down the ability to think logically, the people getting the vaccine are mostly getting it out of fear.
1/1	Fear the virus, not the vaccine.
0/0	Fear, fear, fear. Fear everything so we can control you
1/1	February is a new month and a step in the right direction Syringe first vaccine done. Hope everyone gets there‚Äôs ASAP Smiling face with 3 hearts #CovidVaccine

1/1	Feeling privileged, extremely pleased, and very grateful to have received the first dose
1/1	Feeling sad lol because who knows when will we get this vaccine in Canada :(
1/1	Feeling so blessed to have had my 1st COVID19 vaccine yesterday.
1/1	Feeling so blessed to have my first COVID-19 vaccine dose! Thank you to every scientist, clinical trial participant,, public health advocate, supply chain worker,healthcare worker,GoN and anyone & everyone who helped us get this far. Let‚Äôs mitigate the spread!
1/1	Feeling so unbelievably grateful that we started vaccination today. A whole year into life in this pandemic it finally feels like we can see light at the end of the tunnel. So many people worked endlessly to keep us all safe and I am so thankful.
1/1	Feeling very grateful to have been vaccinated today
1/1	Feeling very grateful.
1/1	Feels good to hear someone talking about the mRNA vaccine with the same enthusiasm I felt when I learned about this AWESOME technology. People around me were hesitant because the technology is new, but aren't we using new technologies all the time? Besides, the mechanism behind the mRNA vaccine isn't new at all. I mean, taking advantage of our cell's protein factories is just what viruses do, right? Nothing new there. The only new thing is that some incredibly ingenious people have figured out how WE can teach our own cells to produce a particular protein. Once again, science is just learning to copy things nature has been doing for millions and billons of years, and I'm amazed by the fact that we now can deliver blueprints to our very own cells. Isn't that just mind-boggling in its awesomeness? Forget about hoverboards and teleportation, get your shiny high-tech science-fiction style mRNA shots while you can. The future is now.
1/1	Feels good. I‚Äôm on immune suppressing drugs, so I was afraid my shots (Moderna) might not work as intended, and people with autoimmune diseases were excluded from the studies. I felt like shit from the 2nd shot, which I took to be a good sign. Doctor ordered antibody test anyway, and I made antibodies. It‚Äôs such a relief to feel protected.
1/1	Feels like all the vaccine panicking people sitting in comments on YouTube, because in real life most people getting vaccine with minor side effects.
1/1	Feels so good to be able to say I was vaccinated two weeks ago! Two more weeks until my second shot. Though I do wo√¢‚Ç¨¬¶
0/0	Fellow nurse here who also declined the V & chose to trust my immune system
1/1	Felt quite emotional seeing the signs up directing us to our local COVID vaccination centre, silly maybe but looking forward to getting my vaccine.
0/0	Ffs so sick of all these vaccines!!!
0/0	Fight fight. We are fighting as well in Poland. No to Vaccination.
0/0	Fight opression...they are using this pendemic to take away our right , our freedome bit by bit‚Ä¶
0/1	Finally a doctor that has some sense. I'm not subjecting myself to the covid vaccine
0	Finally a truthful Dr!!! I‚Äôve been saying this to family, friends, and coworkers‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm almost 50 and never had a flu shot!!! Drunk driver deaths are higher than flu deaths but I don‚Äôt see alcohol or cars being discontinued!!
1/1	Finally a video where the information is presented clearly and concisely, with no overt agenda. This makes me feel significantly better about the vaccine. Still interested in any longer term effects, but seeing how it works coupled with a rudimentary understanding of cell biology, I feel more confident in the notion that there will be limited long term effects.
1/1	Finally a voice of sanity in this comment section. Thank you! We need more vaccinated people to combat the common enemy: Covid.
1/1	Finally an end in sight. Once the whole family is vaccinated, normal life can start.
1/1	Finally got Covid. Fortunately I had done my own research, and concluded that I should be fully vaccinated and get a booster shot, so I've had very mild symptoms so far. Highly recommend doing your own research, which will lead you to the same conclusion!
1/1	Finally got my appointment! Wednesday here I come!,
1/1/1/1	Finally got my first covid vaccine today. So far no tail or unicorn horn or anything exciting. Just a sore arm. Grateful for progress.

1/1	Finally some good news. When it comes available in the future hopefully it‚Äôs enough supply for everyone
1/-1	Finally someone that shares the truth about this vaccine ..its science...it changes otherwise it wouldn't be science
1/-1	Finally something positive!!!!
1/1	Finally the vaccines are here! Who‚Äôs happy???
1/1/1/1	Finally vaccinated As per National Vaccination plan, i can say Our Made in India Covishield vaccines are safe.
1/1	Finally was able to get signed up for the vaccine at a semi-local hospital.
1/1	Finally we are GETTING SOMEWHERE‚Ä¶. Anti-vaxiners become less and less and we gonna get rid of this bsht virus
0/0	Finally we are getting somewhere. Proof that the vaccine dies not work, you mean.
1/1	Finally we can get vaccinated

1/1	Finally, good news
1/1	Finally, it's all gonna be over
1/1	Finally, someone who has the right information on these vaccines and presents it clearly. I do not regret that I took the vaccine!
1/1	Finally, watched. Very interesting! Thank you again for bringing us clear and well explained information without the biased politics! And Thanks Dr Kim for your continuous efforts to develop a vaccine.
1/1	Finally. Can't wait to get this to the masses. Give the mRNA to the older generation and this to the youngans since it protects them better.
1	Finally. Hope to get mine in a couple of months. Totally ready to go to a crowded restaurant and back to the movies!!!
1/1	Finally. This vaccination has a promising role in immune compromised folks. Fewer side effects. We have 5 vaccines and 6 treatments. The virus has variants. Battle is joined in the last chapter of this pandemic. Getting 75% to 100 % of human adults vaccinated should make this manageable in 2022. The vaccination of children helps them and slows spread outside the school well. Over 4 billion people are vaccinated now at some level. There are 7.88 billion people on Earth ??.
1/1	Finaly things can go back to normal
1/-1	Find a dr who says donot get this vaccine..l
0/0	Find a vaccine that works and I will be on board. You really should find another name for the jab. A vaccine it is not! A vaccine works the Covid vaccine does not! Maybe just call it a Covid shot like the annual flu shot! Just a thought for you wizards!
0/0	Find it hard to believe they just whipped up this vaccine really quick. Baa Baa Baaaaaaa haha
1/1	Find it weird that the fervent supporters of herd immunity don‚Äôt actually want herd immunity now that‚Äôs it can be achieved with a vaccine.
1/1	Find your place in the vaccine line! Hope see you in the vaccine line soon!
1/1	Fine anti-vaxxers, we won‚Äôt blame the virus if it kills you guys; well just blame your poor choice.
1/1	Fine message. I have completed the two doses. Except body pain no other side-effects are noticeable.
1/1	Fine message. I have completed the two doses. Except body pain no other side-effects are noticeable.üôè
1/1	Fine with me. I‚Äôm very happy to do my part and not get Covid and die. Or pass it one to someone else who would die. It‚Äôs called civilization bubbas
1/1	Fine, no one's saying survivors don't have some natural immunity. But if you want to avoid infection (with all possible morbidities), or have a relatively mild case, get vaccinated.
1/0	Fine. Don‚Äôt take the vaccine. Enough people will take it to counter your ignorance. Just don‚Äôt expect to be allowed to travel across any international borders.
1/1	Fine. don't get vaccines. But don't take up my resources when you get sick from something you could have prevented.
1/-1	Finger crossed for Pfizer vaccine
1/-1/1	Fingers crossed every single private institution requires proof of vaccine for people to enter once it has been widely available.
1/1	Finished my second round of phyzer (spl?) over a week ago. First round, a little soreness, second round a little more soreness and a day of feeling a bit tired. Very happy I was eligible and willing.
1/1	Fire her if she refuses to get vaccinated!
0/0	Fire me. I‚Äôll die on this hill. I‚Äôm not doing it. I was planning on getting the vaccine, but until this is overturned I‚Äôm never getting it.
1/-1	First
0/1	First BioNTech, then Oxford, we seem to be on a very good trajectory.
1/1/1/1	First Pfizer's is 90% effective, and now Moderna's is 95%? This is fantastic, especially with so many people wary of the vaccine. We're almost there, everyone!
0/0	First and second shots don‚Äôt work! Pushing the boosters is comical, especially for teens. You have lost all credibility!
1/1	First coronavirus vaccine shots given in U.S. Thank you Mr. President!

1/1	First dose on board March 24th. #2 coming up. Science is freaking amazing!
1/1	First dose taken. Never felt better <3
1/1	First dose today! I got my first dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine today and I'm feeling more than better.
1/1	First in line! I will take my chances. I am a Chauffeur. In cars with people I don't know. I promise you this. No one get in the vehicle without as mask! Or they are walking!
0/0	First it was 2 weeks to flatten the curve, then wear a mask to save Grandpa, then wait till the vaccine, well now all of a sudden Grandpa is Vaccinated and getting arrested for not wearing a mask. This was never about a virus, time to RISE
0/0	First it was get the two shots now it‚Äôs get 2 with a booster. Next month or two it will be get the booster or you will no longer be considered fully vaccinated‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs no wonder why no one trusts you liars!
0/0	First it was no boosters, then a booster every 6 months, now 3 months. Next, it'll be every month, wait. Big pharma will not be denied.
0/0	First mRna vaccine in history, with side effects monitored for less than 365 days. No thanks, I won't be a guinea pig for this mass gene therapy.
0/0	First make sure the vaccines are fully tested and proven safe before pushing the world to take them. We are not your test animals.
1/-1	First of all people are a little bit too sensitive and second of all in comparison to something that happened in history there's nothing wrong with that because if it relates to the current situations that's going on it's totally relevant how that hurt someone's feelings is beyond me, its because it was a terrible thing and we should learn from history instead of repeating it
0/0	First of all, It is not "safe"..people have actually died from it....GLHF Dont trust the robots
0/0	First of all, it is not a vaccine, it's a therapeutic. It doesn't eradicate or eliminate anything
0/-1	First off by "coronavirus vaccines" you mean sars virus vaccine, and they been studying that for more like a decade and a half. Secondly they might be if the same family of viruses, but they have not been studying a new virus that appeared 3 years ago 10 years ago. They may be similar but they are not the same virus. Have fun with blood clots lab rat.
1/1	First read this prediction and thought, Well in New York seems I'm falling in that 10%. Then I read that Cuomo was opening vaccines to 30+ tomorrow! So if you're 30+ in NY, get in line and get your vaccine. Let's beat this.
1/1	First shot down... I‚Äôve had a recent history with some bad lungs issues so I‚Äôm happy that I‚Äôve finally started this process. GET VACCINATED, FRIENDS! SAVE LIVES.
1/1	First shot of Pfizer. Sore arm for a few hours. That's it.
1/0/1/1/0/1/0/1/1/1/1/0/1	First time I see people being more afraid of a cure than the actual virus
1/1	First time I see people being more afraid of a cure than the actual virus.

1/0/0/0/1/0/0/0/0/0/1/0	First time in history that the ineffectiveness of a medicine is being blamed on those who haven't taken it.
0/0	First use the corrupt politicians as guinea pigs!!
1/1	First vaccination tomorrow, which is great. Only 1/5 of my elderly vulnerable family vaccinated, which isn't great. Hearing so many stories of failure to provide the infrastructure for mass vaccinations.
1/1	First vaccine done!
1/1/1	First vaccine today! Got the Moderna. Everything was extremely well organized. This is a good day!
0/0	First volunteer for COVID-19 Vaccine is dead. She died 2days after availing herself for the vaccination.
1/1	First walk today since testing covid negative on Wednesday. Got through it ok just took a bit longer. I have noticed that even tho I am negative there are some lingering symptoms. Please get vaccinated. I don't know how I would have coped without being dble vaxed.
0/0	First you both inject this tasty mRNA vaccine, upload your video of both doses.
0/0	First, don‚Äôt talk to us as we are clueless kids. Second, I watched this video till the end just to hear your main argument for safety is ‚Äú science is awesome?‚Äù Common. For the first time in history you tell the human cell to produce a foreign particle that the immune system detects as threat, and all you have to say is ‚Äúawesome‚Äù ? This is the main reason why folks are concerned and there is absolutely no credible explanation offered as to how this mechanism of artificial manipulation of human cell to manufacture a part of the virus is safe, ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and harmless.
0/0	First, let the government test it on themselves and after some time we‚Äôll see if it‚Äôs so cool.
0/0	Fk your genocide Vaxx
0/0	Flu is down 98% this season with it being relabeled covid19
1/0	Flu shots are free. Why wouldn't Covid shots be?
1/1	Flu vaccines have been around for years. Most of these vaccines are just alterations of already existing vaccines. It's not like they had to design an Ebola vaccine from scratch..
0/0	Flu yes covid no. I will not get that for my children. That vaccine could have dangerous long term effects. I for one don't want to make that decision for my children.
1/1	Folks need to realize the power of science, when they made these vaccinations they were only working on this particular one, so all the time and effort was focused on one viruses! It was not made over night! Think about the flu vaccination, it? a guess each year as to which one will hit! MANY MANY HOURS went into this shot. That could save many lives!

1/1	Folks, the lamda variant is just for all the lamda people. Many of my friends regret not having taken the vaccine. Let's be strong advocates for barrier measures. When life is under siege, everyone must be a soldier of hope‚Ä¶
1/1	Follow the Science people, if you don't get vaccinated you can give the virus to vaccinated people!
1/1	Follow the science! I support vaccines
1/-1	Followed this account ages ago with my mates as a joke but this isn't funny. This virus has killed over 100,000 people. Stay safe and stop spreading bullshit
1/1	For Jumpstar: Exact quote from the Oregonian: "Nearly four in five coronavirus deaths in Oregon during the first four weeks of August were among unvaccinated or partially vaccinated individuals, according to new data released by the Oregon Health Authority. And roughly five in six of the 51,391 known COVID-19 infections during the same period were among people who were unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated, according to a state report released Thursday. The share of so-called breakthrough cases and deaths among fully vaccinated Oregonians remains tiny compared to the 2.4 million Oregonians who were fully vaccinated as of Aug.28, demonstrating the effectiveness of vaccines at preventing severe COVID-19."
0/0	For a man who has openly stated that overpopulation is a problem, he is oddly concerned with saving lives with the vaccine?
1/1	For a vaccine we're looking at 12-18 months üòû
0/0	For all of you that don't know getting that shot nullifies health and life insurance policies
1/1	For all the anti-vaccine kids reading the comments , don't be scared the rest us who're all vaccinated we'll keep you safe :)
1/1	For all the crazy psychopaths in this comment section complaining over the vaccine being administered on live TV, I got both my doses already and have had absolutely no reactions.
1/1	For all the nay sayers trying to turn this into an opportunity to bash the Welsh Government - who cares? The sooner we have a majority vaccinated, the sooner we have a chance of rates dropping, and the sooner we have a chance of some (some, not total) return to normality and people having a living and a life. Probable most importantly, the sooner you can stop your whinging, about this anyway.
1/1	For all the negative people on here. Shut up . Be well happy there is a vaccine !
1/1	For anyone who wants their lives back, take the vaccine.
1/1	For better or worse, the recent news about the extremely rare blood clots for both J&J and AZ puts into perspective how impressive the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are. Even more good news for Moderna here. (Of course, I‚Äôm not suggesting that one should not accept J&J/AZ... I‚Äôm just impressed that Moderna/Pfizer are doing so well given their huge rollout)
1/1	For every kid who died because of vaccines 1000 died because the lack of it
1/1	For everyone saying they ‚Äúwon‚Äôt take a rushed vaccine‚Äù, none of this was rushed. They just accelerated the process with the use of newer technology. They still had many trials and errors, many different vaccines that made it through and many that did not. Stop trying to ‚Äúspread awareness‚Äù of a fact that isn‚Äôt even true.
1/0	For everyone talking about their symptoms from getting their shot, I‚Äôve heard the worse it is for you the worse COVID would‚Äôve been. Sorta why some people are experiencing nothing from the shot and some are tired for 3 days. If the shot does a number on you then you are definitely glad you got it!
1/1	For everyones safety, being unvaccinated should be illegal
1/1	For gods sake the scientists know their work, its been tested thoroughly!!
1/1	For goodness sake you people be thankful for all the work done to get us this vaccine, people a lot cleverer than you
1/-1	For me personally I'd be far more convinced by a person who presents data than a person who presents personal anecdotes.
1/1	For me, personally, I am more afraid of long-covid and shit like this than I am of the side effects of most of the vaccines.
0/0	For more than 15years the vaccine for HIV has not been found, how possible can it be for this corona lasting for a year and some good months to be found, let's take heart.
0/1	For my recent Twitter followers - this by Neville Hodgkinson back in July reported that the actual efficacy in Pfizer's' own report was only ever 0.84% - that's the ARR or Absolute Risk Reduction.
1/1	For non vaccinated.. They may have the right not to be vaccinated but I have the right to not be around them.
0/0	For normal everyday use, those who get the double shots, are being hospitalized at a ratio of 9 to 1 over unvaccinated.
1/1	For now we don't have othewise other than taking the risk
1	For now, the reason I'm not taking it is because there are others who need it more than me; first responders, healthcare workers, and people at higher risk. But you better believe that the second it's available for us muggles, I'll be the first on line!
1/1	For once I'm actually glad to be in the U.S during covid. Our vaccine rollout has been crazy, I'm 25 with no existing conditions and got my second shot today. Anyone over 16 is eligible in many places here now, it's honestly impressive.
1/1	For once in my life I find myself agreeing with Boris Johnson. This won't become a habit. We all knew this virus would mutate over time and it will do so again. The important thing is to keep faith in the vaccine for otherwise we are defeated.
0/0	For once, I agree, that vaccine is doing a lot of damage‚Ä¶
1/1	For once, my state is at the top of the good lists, when we are mostly at the bottom. We have the third highest rate of vaccination rollouts of any other state so far. I personally have had both doses of the vaccine now and I'm not over 65 nor am I in a frontline position. I'm so hopeful now :)
1/1	For people who are anti vaccine, I feel sad for you. This is not a political issue and the fact people try to play that game are just sad. Think about your health and of others and not politics.
0/1/0	For people who don't want to get vaccinated, that is fine. The question is "What are they going to do in order to prevent or transmit infection to others?" Are they faithfully masking with N95 or higher with a properly fitting mask? Distancing on top of that? Are they scrupulously cleaning their hands, keys, phone, doorknobs, car controls, etc.? Are they avoiding bars, restaurants, or any other place where they would be removing their mask in public? Are they isolating at home? If yes, then THEY DON'T NEED THE VACCINE because they will not contract the virus. The problem is that people want to get "back to normal" and go to the beach, bars, restaurants, see relatives and friends, etc. You either have to live in a bubble, take your chances with the vaccine, or take your chances with COVID. I already had COVID in Feb of 2019 and it was BRUTAL. I choose the bubble. After adequate time, maybe I will choose the vaccine. But until then, it is my DUTY to other people not to get sick or pass it to others.
0/-1	For perspective, I've had clots during pregnancy and after. I also had a pulmonary embolism while 21/22 weeks pregnant. I'd specifically like to avoid being in the ICU on a vent again.
0/-1	For some health-care workers, experience in an industry that seems to put profits over patients and staff contributes to hesitancy about the COVID-19 vaccines.
0/0	For something with a 99.97% survivability and hasn't been isolated.
1/1	For sure! But I‚Äôd be lying if I said I wasn‚Äôt nervous
1/1	For sure, my grandma is already vaccinated so once I get mine me and gram gram are gonna chill
1/1	For sure. I'm positive now and it freaking sucks. I couldn't eat without throwing up and just washing dishes feels like running a marathon.
1/1	For the anti Vaxxers, look at the comments from hpv vaccines. Look no one turned into no zombie
1/1	For the anti Vaxxers, look at the comments from hpv vaccines. Look no one turned into no zombie üßü‚ôÄÔ∏è they require up to three vaccines depending on the age.

0/1	For the first time in history, the ineffectiveness of a medicine is being blamed on those who refuse to take it... Hey Global why don't you report on that?
0/0	For the love of God, stop pushing these vaccines!
1/1	For the people who are unvaccinated and saying it‚Äôs some big conspiracy theory, I would love to see reputable sources or just sources in general saying that exact same thing. Because you‚Äôre just blowing hot air at this point
1/1	For the people who not taking it, I understand. I just don't wanna hear any complaining from them if shit gets shut down again or if they bar non-vaccinated people from certain things
1/1	For the record I am still patiently waiting for the Vaccine I got last week to turn me into a 5G Cell phone tower. All you people on the internet said it have computer chips in it and I am in serious need of better cell service at my house.. But zero damned change in signal, just some crappy immunity.
0/0	For the record, I have not taken, nor do I intend to take any Covid Vaccine
1/1	For the sake of humanity, take the vaccine!
1	For the sake of the people around me i will, but im not very inclined to...
1/1	For the ten zillionth time! The vaccines were NOT created in a year. there is about 20 years worth of work behind them ever since the SARS outbreak at the beginning of the 21st century. FYI SARS was a Coronavirus too!
0/0	For the time being, no. I am over 65, overweight and need knee replacement surgery (before you jump to conclusions, I had an injury 33 years ago BEFORE I became overweight and have had 4 surgeries on that knee. Over the years I have gained weight because I could no longer be as active as I had been).
1/1	For the vast majority of people, the benefits of being vaccinated against covid outweigh the potential risks
1/1	For those anti vacciners because I know there are some here lurking. I‚Äôll give you the benefit of the doubt side effects and such and such but would you rather die of covid?
1/1	For those in the back who weren't paying attention, Israel is essentially Covid free. Because of vaccines. Hopefully this will happen in many other countries in the coming months. #VaccinesWork
1/1	For those panicking about the 1 in several hundred thousand chance of blood clots from the Astrazenica vaccine, this is a list of possible side-effects of over-the counter painkillers affecting 1 in 1,000 people. No medicine is 100% risk-free!
1/1	For those people who are against the #CovidVaccine, I would hope this graph help illustrates the stark difference in mortality. Is dying, or worse still being crippled for life, worth it to not #GetVaccinatedNow? 20x greater mortality, & greater severity of disease & disability
1/1	For those saying why I insist that everyone needs to have their shot while being already vaccinated, it is because I am still in higher risk because of all of you not choosing to vaccinate.
1/0	For those scared of getting cancer, re-read some of the meds you take for diagnosed conditions like autoimmune ones. The drugs that they give you will have cancer and neurological side effects. Those who use recreational drugs or smoke, well if you can take that than what is a vaccine?
0/0	For those that died taking the placebo, I want to thank you and your family. Your sacrifice has been noted, honored and truly appreciated may you rest in peace o protector of the human species.
1/1	For those that still think it‚Äôs not real talk to a doctor or nurse. Listen to what they have to say. We usually listen to them and follow what they recommend. Yet with this ppl say it‚Äôs political. Wife is vaccinated. I got first shot. Getting 2nd soon. The older generation learned from polio and other stuff that vaccines work. Yet my generation thinks it‚Äôs all a conspiracy. Smmfh all because we didn‚Äôt live thru what the older generation did. Seeing it first hand. Well now we are seeing it
1	For those who appreciate scientific arguments watch Gershom Zajicek M.D, Asymptomatics are protected against coronavirus mutations

1/1	For those who follow and understand science, the answer is yes.
1/1	For those who say I don't what's in it do you know what's in the everyday pills you take
1/1	For transparency and for the peace of mind for everyone, I think we should have Moderna and Pfizer vaccines
0/0	For what it‚Äôs worth, I had the most mild case in August 2021. I ONLY lost my sense of smell. Last week I shared a smoke with a friend WITH COVID and have not been reinfected.

0/0	Forcing people to have invasive medical treatment is wrong.
0/-1	Forcing people to have no options and take the mRNA which has as many serious side effects and blood clots too. If the J&J is a problem you can bet they other two are as well. And govt wants to force people to get these experimental medical products ? Scary
1/1	Forecasters predicting 2 feet of snow in greater Philly area...our first Philly blizzard and our generator has not yet been installed. This could get interesting...Hope I can get to my COVID vaccine appointment on Thursday.
1/1	Forget about all the doubters...they always want the worse or the worst for the whole globe but for me I am already in with the V-sign from here in Kenya! Some guys are always just there to critisize every achievement when they are non-partisan themselves!There is a vaccine out there and I eagerly waith for it...Thank you WHO for the legal approvals after a very very long period of months!
0/-1	Forget the experimental vaccine. We are missing a huge and important piece of data by not having the antibody test readily available. How many of us have already had it? 70% of those who tested positive were asymptomatic- which means the denominator of those infected is likely way bigger than we know - making the actual death percentage completely unreliable.
0/0	Forget the so called "statistics" they use now, in my life the people who got vaccine and boosters got the most serious cases. The ones that didn't get serious cases got sick when they got the vaccines and the booster only to get sick again when they got COVID.

0	Frankly to put the blame on the people who are not vaccinated who don't go out that they can't go to the restaurant not take the train and we just told them that it's their fault if people die I think we're walking on our heads here, I don't understand why you demonize people who just put doubts and we have to take the word of our politicians and the scientist when several times they lied to us. You should more turn your hatred against the government that left the hospitals dead for more than 20 years and to all this pharmaceutical lobby that have lawsuits in the ass like nobody in the world.

0/0	From all I've seen and heard the covid vaccine will be the most dangerous there's ever been - and I've seen plenty of vaccine injuries - some I had on internal ventilation in intensive care as a result, others had died as a result.
0/0	From my analysis getting the vaccine for my case (young, healthy man) has a higher risk than being sick for covid. It's a serious question, I'd like to see how to approach it from a different perspective.
1/1	From my point of view I agree with some experts argue that preventing any infection at all is not always the point of vaccine, the goal of vaccine program for Covid-19 is not necessarily to get to 'Covid Zero' but to remove its ability to cause serious disease, hospitalization and death.
1/1	From the Texas Department of State Health Services: "In the September time frame, unvaccinated people in their 40s were 55 times more likely to die from COVID-19 compared with fully vaccinated people of the same age." 11/2021

0/0	Get the vaccine, then instead of wearing one mask you need 2. Yeah Um I‚Äôm gonna question that logic instead of bowing to the liberal elites. I will never follow the liberal cult.

1/1	Getting better....we need to keep increasing and get to 3 million a day
0/1	Getting closer and closer to making it mandatory. I see the moves being made! Biggest drug deal in history. Take note!!!
1/1	Getting covid & dying from it are 2 very different things. Yes u can still get CoVid & pass it even while vax‚Äôed but it reduces mortality aka dying from CoVid. Ive seen many deaths & so far, in my personal experience, they were not vax‚Äôed. So statistically speaking, the vax helps.
1/1	Getting covid vaccines is actually less risky than other more traditional vaccines.

1	Getting my second dose in about a month ! Hoping it goes smoothly but 2 days of not feeling great is way better than covid !
1/1	Getting my second dose of Moderna tomorrow morning. With a background in public health and infectious diseases, I have followed the prior development of mRNA delivery technology, and I was delighted that it was applied early to bring vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 to market. Now, to see if my immune system will actually develop antibodies unlike during my contact with the virus last spring. I have faith since mRNA is literally telling my cells how to build antibodies and what the virus looks like.
1/1	Getting my second dose on Monday

1/1	Getting second vaccination in Minnesota March 23. That will be a relief.
1/1	Getting stressed about the unvaccinated. This will never end if they don‚Äôt get vaccinated.
1/1	Getting the #COVID19 vaccine #booster is an essential step towards curbing the spread of the virus.
0/0	Getting the antibodies from having COVID is also as effective‚Ä¶and natural. During the worst pandemic we had during the Spanish flu..natural immunity took over within two years‚Ä¶masks were their best protection.
1/1	Getting the covid vaccine is no different in getting any another vaccine it better than dying get over u anti vaxxers
0/0	Getting the initial jabs out is to see how the public will react and to gauge the uptake. The sheep are being turned in to guinea-pigs x
1/1	Getting the vaccine cuts down the infection chain!
1/1	Getting the vaccine is an act of altruism: You are not just protecting yourself, but also helping to protect society as a whole, especially those so are most vulnerable.
0/0	Getting the vaccine means getting the virus! I ain't gonna keep up with this shit!
1/1	Getting the vaccine significantly reduces the likelihood of getting the disease, transmitting it to others, and if you get COVID your symptoms are reduced. It‚Äôs common sense to get vaccinated when you can.
1/1	Getting the vaccine to protect yourself from hospitalization will keep the hospitals ready for your grandparents should they need it
1/1	Getting the vaccine tomorrow ü§©
1/1	Getting these vaccines to the poor needs to be a top priority.
1/1	Getting this Friday. I don‚Äôt care about people trying to scare me out of it cuz I‚Äôd rather not get covid
0/-1	Getting vaccinated after you've had the virus doesn't make sense. After I had shingles i asked my doctor about the vaccine and he said it wasn't necessary as I already had the virus. So what is going on with covid-19 vaccines
1	Getting vaccinated against COVID-19 can lower your risk of getting and spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Vaccines can also help prevent serious illness and death.
1/1	Getting vaccinated also may protect people around you ‚Äî particularly those at greater risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
1/1	Getting vaccinated and then natural infection seems best
1/1	Getting vaccinated creates an antibody response, so that you are protected without having to experience the illness
0/0	Getting vaccinated don‚Äôt mean nothing nothing ppl who have got it still caught COVID and died.
1/1	Getting vaccinated for COVID-19 can help stop other variants from emerging
1/1	Getting vaccinated is NOT a surrender of your liberty, It's an affirmation of , Responsibility, Care and love for yourself and others.
1/1	Getting vaccinated is a must. But dont forget you are protected only by the proper face mask since many are still not vaccinated.
1/1	Getting vaccinated is being careful. Getting the virus is riskier for all age groups.
1/1	Getting vaccinated is being part of the solution. Not getting vaccinated is being part of the problem. Be a part of the solution.
0/0	Getting vaccinated is free. But the end results of the vaccines are not free.
1/1	Getting vaccinated is like wearing a seatbelt in a car. Doesn't mean you won't get hurt in an accident, but decreases your chance of dying.
0/1	Getting vaccinated is not just about the person getting the shot, it's saving the lives of others if you don't and transfr the disease as a carrier .That should be the message to those who are scared and reluctant .
1/1	Getting vaccinated is safer than getting infected
1/1	Getting vaccinated is social responsibility, don't ask what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country. Watching him back peddle to retain his job is sad. I don't watch him anymore since he jumped platforms. He changed maggoty
1/1	Getting vaccinated is the most patriotic thing you can do. Pass it on.
1/1	Getting vaccinated means that you look after yourself and also show consideration for those around you.
1/1	Getting vaccinated prevents severe illness. Why is this so hard to comprehend?
1	Getting vaccinated provides greater protection to others since the vaccine helps reduce the spread of COVID-19.
1/1	Getting vaccinated saves lives. Not getting vaccinated can end lives. Enough said
1/1	Getting vaccinated yourself may also protect people around you, particularly people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19
1/1	Getting vaccinated yourself may also protect people around you, particularly people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
1/1	Getting vaccined finally!!!
1/1	Getting your vaccine is a very Christian think to do. You are looking out for the well-being of other people.
0/0	Gibraltar: Huge surge in 'Covid deaths' after the implementation of 'Covid vaccines' as 4 times as more people die of 'Covid' in three weeks than in the previous ten months since 'Covid' was discovered.
0/0	Gimme a break...could be anything in that syringe.

1/1	Gimme that shit. Fill me up baby. I need it
1/1	Give a nurse a break. Get vaccinated 85% of hospitalized Covid patients are unvaccinated
1/1	Give everyone A vaccine and then let's worry about the details later. For now, more immunizations regardless of which one it is.
1/1	Give her proof about COVID. Don‚Äôt argue, just cough on her. She‚Äôll have to learn the hard way.
0/-1	Give her the vaccine. She already looks dead. Sick people
0/0	Give it to Bill Gates the creator of vaccines
0/0	Give it to all the politicians and their families first, wait a year and see how they are going on with it
0	Give it to the commies first.
1/1	Give it to the people who want it. Those who think it is not safe, let them device a plan to protect themselves. I for one is ready to be vaccinated when my turn comes up!
0/0	Give it to the pigs first.
0/-1	Give it to the politicians first, the real deal and not saline shots for tv. If they're still alive and not riddled with exotic cancers in 10 years, the shot could be safe. If they all die from it, then we the citizens will be safe. It's win-win.
0/0/0/0	Give me 50 grand ill take it otherwise no

0/0	Give them the vaccine, a lot of jobs will be available after the side effects kick in.
0/0/0	Give vaccine to victim nor healthy innocence.Satan vaccinate your own self with your agents.God is God and God alone is my HEALTH.
1	Give vaccines to poorer nations so we don‚Äôt have another variant!
0/0	Given Moderna's share price is down 70% in the past 3 months, they had to launch a new product whether its actually needed or not.
1/1	Given a 5% chance of death with COVID, 1 in a million to have non-lethal blood clots with this vaccine is well worth the risk.
0/0	Given how much of a rush there has been to push the vaccine out, I can't say these results surprise me. Normal testing for a vaccine to go into production has been at a minimum 6 years and often takes over 10. My concern is that a rushed vaccine being pushed on people is going to create a whole new flock of anti vaxxers the likes of which we have not seen in the past. Even some of those who typically trust science will be wary that the proper process may not have been followed given the rush and due to the fact such an enormous economical impact is on the line for governments to get people vaccinated. We have some big challenges ahead of us and I hope I am wrong.
1/1	Given that there are people out there who genuinely struggle to believe that the earth is not flat, it's not exactly surprising that plenty don't understand covid either
1/-1	Given that vaccinations have helped people who have "Long Haul" covid symptoms, do you think giving the vaccine to people who are hospitalized might help them?
0/0/0/0	Given the fact the first two shots failed, why would someone sign up for 3rd dose?
1/1	Given the millions who've received the vaccine versus those who have reported blood clots, I'd still say the vaccine is safe for the vast majority of people.
1/1	Given their mishandling of vaccines so far, the Morrison/Murdoch government should be trying to source all four major, approved, vaccines. You'd think they would have learnt their lesson that putting all your eggs in one basket is not a great idea. Of course, now that we are languishing at around 100th in the world for vaccine rollout, our negotiating position with the big pharmaceutical companies isn't very strong.
1/1	Giving facts to the ignorant is like giving medicine to the dead
0/0	Giving vaccines to create Zombie.
1/1	Glad I found this video to show my parents! They‚Äôre 88 and 87 and had an appointment to get the vaccine but my anti vac brothers talked them out of it with a videoü§®so I‚Äôm going to play yours for them this morning. Great information!! Thank you for taking the time to make this video!

0/0	Glamorising an untested vaccine no one knows the long term effects of for a virus with a survival rate over 99%! Disgusting
1/1	Global anti-vaccine messaging around the adenovirus vaccines means that more people will die and the pandemic will be prolonged.
1/1	Global death toll from Covid-19 tops 5 million, less than two years into the pandemic.And yet many millions are putting their lives at risk in the belief that Vaccinations are dangerous and wont get vaxxed.

Yes! If not for yourself, then get vaccinated for your family! I am SO grateful to have been a part of the Pfizer study. I am a woman of color, with underlying health issues and I am over the age of 60. I cannot tell you what a blessing it has been knowing that I was able to help some people out there. Peace to all of you.
1/-1	God brought him the vaccine,but Marcus was too blind to see
1/-1	God damn it, the virus isn't a hoax
0/0	God gave me a healthy immune system I haven't had the flues or cold for a couple of years I've had a flu shot last year I stay healthy to eat healthy with plenty of vitamins no to this vaccine.
0/0	God gave us something to battle viruses, it's called an immune system.
0/0	God gave you a body that heals itself.
0/0	God gave you a immunity system and it works fine , then you decide I will let some pharmaceutical company mess with it, because there smarter then God. Wake up people.
0/0	God gave you an immune system for a reason. If you take care of your natural immune system, you‚Äôd have nothing to worry about. You ever hear of GMO? Well, those who take the unproven vaccines are GMH. Genetically modified humans. When you try to fuck with nature, nature will find a way to fuck you back. You can‚Äôt kill a non living virus and Nature/God did not put these things on this planet to kill us. They were placed on this planet to help us evolve. If you put yourself in a sterile bubble, you will die faster. We are made from and need this micro and viral biomes in order to survive. Who trusts their corrupt government, big pharma, media and religion nowadays. They are in it for the money, not for your well being. Germany and China controls the cyber, diagnostics and Health care industries. Do you really trust your competitor and enemies? If you take the vaccine, I hope you get the placebo. The manufacturer controls that shit and you just trust them. Stupid people deserve to die.
1/1	God help these psychopathic narcissists causing this fear amongst those in society..
1/1/1/1	God help us to get more people vaccinted quickly.
0/0	God is the only vaccine
0/0	God knows what's really in these shots, I'm not taking it any time soon

1/1	Gonna get the vaccine::)) Fingers crossed??! It‚Äôs the only way!
1/1	Gonna have to disagree with you here. Trust the science. Sure some people will have allergic reactions but that happens with all vaccines.
0/0	Gonna turn zombies
0/0	Gonna wait at least ten or so years and see if there's any long term side effects.... dont wanna see an ad on TV in ten years saying "did you take the covid vaccine back in 2021? You may be entitled to compensation"

0/0	Good for you. I have been healthy until I got the vaccine.
0/0	Good god theyre putting their poison into flu jab too now
1/1	Good health vaccine from covid 19
1/1	Good information my family and I are definitely taking this vaccine.
0/1	Good information! Yet, the contention that post-COVID-19 should get vaccinated is NOT based on evidence but PURE speculation! Also massvacination when infections are high bears risk of immune escape mutations. Who are your advisors?
1/1	Good job Will, I am not afraid of shots eitherI will definitely get the Covid vaccine
1/1	Good job boris and to all involved rolling out the vaccine. üòÅ
1/1	Good job! If you save your self by getting vaccinated that means you save the whole people's surrounding.

0/0/0/0	Good luck being test person
0/0	Good luck to the young women who want to have children in future, be prepared for birth defects after taking this poison.
0/0	Good luck to those who've gotten the vaccine already. From what I've heard, it's with you for LIFE - and nobody knows the long term risks. Gulp.
0/0	Good luck we won't take your posion.
0/0	Good luck with the #Herdstupidity #herdimmunity
0/0	Good luck with the experiment y'all

1/1/1/-1	Good news
1/1	Good news I'm going for my Covid vaccine jab today. First step to travelling again..
1/1	Good news for the whole world! Once US is done internally, we will flood world with vaccines and save this world again!
1/1	Good news for us, a study has revealed that the #Sinopharm vaccine is effective against the SA variant!
1/1	Good news no doubt, but lets not kid ourselves that these vaccines will be a magic bullet that'll immediately return the world to 'normal'. It'll take months, perhaps even years, to get everyone vaccinated. Covid-19 will become endemic (it's virtually impossible to completely eliminate a virus once it's 'out'), so we'll still have to be careful.
1/1	Good news on the vaccine‚Äôs effectiveness in real life!
1/1	Good news that Oxford Vaccine being rolled out today.
1/1	Good news! #PfizerBioNTech vaccines arrived ... other vaccines like #Moderna and #AstraZeneca are also coming
1/1	Good news, even if it‚Äôs completely unsurprising. Vaccines work. Get yours as soon as you can, everyone (assuming you aren‚Äôt medically ineligible).
1/1	Good news, the more vaccines the better!
1/-1	Good news.
0/1	Good news. This study also demonstrates the Pfizer vaccine is protective against the ongoing variants, right?
1/1	Good news. Vaccines work and export restrictions too!
1/1	Good news. We need more vaccines for our country's population and also for those less fortunate than ourselves living in poorer nations.
0/-1	Good old propaganda
0/0	Good on him, great man. Her? Not so much. I‚Äôm not vaccinated, and I‚Äôm not getting vaccinated either.
1/1	Good on ya David. I've had mine. üòä. The only to get back to some normality. The light at the end of the tunnel.
0/0	Good russian roulette! And change your DNA in case you want to be augmented...
0/1	Good sign, then. Here's to hoping nothing untoward happens to the Phase II/III subjects.
0/0	Good still don‚Äôt want it üòÇ
1/1	Good stuff!
1/1	Good stuff! I experienced no symptoms except a sore arm. My brother did get a mild sickness after his second shot. The vaccine prompts an immune response, so that is in fact perfectly normal.
0/0	Good thing it is voluntary, I will Not be getting it. I have too many allergies to medications as it is. Not going to let those dems be the death of me.
1/1	Good thing we can trust the science on the vaccines
1/0	Good though a number of care workers seem to think they would be risking their lives by having it and they've chosen not to pump chemicals into their body whilst tattoos and piercings seem to be the norm!
1/1	Good to hear ... now let's get this covid under control so we can all start living again !!
1/-1	Good to hear JR Spread the word not the virus
1/1	Good to hear JR, I live in the UK and had mine 3 weeks ago how come it's taken this long?
1/1	Good to hear because obviously it would be a waste if the vaccine wasn't bringing the infection rate down. Props to Israel for getting so many vaccinated so quickly.
1/1	Good to hear you had no reaction,,I hope everyone gets vaccinated !
0	Good to know at least someone else doesn't worship Big Pharma.
1/0	Good to know the mRNA is "shredded" by the body after a time period. How long does the nanocytes remain in the body?
1/1	Good to know. I had no side effects. And it worried me even though I retired from the medical field.
1/1	Good to see COVID vaccination campaign has also launched in Pakistan today.
0/0	Good to see so many people finally waking up to what‚Äôs really going on here.. United we stand divided we fall.. I know what side I am fighting for and it isn‚Äôt the side of our government ...
1/-1	Good to see the nurse aspirating that vaccine! Preventing an inadvertent intravascular injection is super important.
1/1	Good work guys! Keep up the vaccine drive!
1/1	Good! The more people vaccinated, the better.And mandate the military all getting vaccinated. It‚Äôs a national security issue.
0/0	Good!!!!We don‚Äôt need it!!!
1/1	Good, I'll be happy to take any of them as my second dose. Seems a sensible idea to test the viability of taking a mix and match approach. I'm certain they will test it thoroughly !
1/1	Good, don't get the shot. natural selection will weed you out. just keep following Trump. more doses for the rest of us.
1/1	Good, let‚Äôs keep rolling out the vaccines now, get back to normal and if necessary roll out more vaccines in the autumn, like we do with flu, and stop making the issue of mutations (that happen anyway) more of an issue than it needs to be.
0/0	Good, nobody wants it. We will resist with force.
1/1	Good, the more vaccinations the less opportunity for the virus to mutate and create variants
1/1	Good- vaccination is our only way out of this emergency.
1	Good. Anti vaxxxers are literally some of the dumbest people along with flat earthers.
1/1/1/1	Good. Hopefully it's up to 2M per day by February.
1/-1	Good. I'm taking it. Evangelical freaks will probably not take it, thinking it's that "mark of the beast" BS though... FORCE THEM.
1/-1	Good. Let natural selection run its course
1/1	Good. More countries need to follow the lead of the US and come down hard on the unvaccinated.
1/-1	Good. That means I will get it quicker.
1/1	Good. There's lots of vaccine hesitant people who are more comfortable with the J&J vaccine than mRNA. Disagree with them all you want, but the best way to get shots in arms is to get J&J back on the market, not to convince them to get an mRNA shot.
1/1	Good. Time to fight back against the idiots who believe that vaccines and vaccine mandates are in some way hurting their "freedom". All they are doing is prolonging the pandemic and adding to the economic hardship faced by millions. The silent majority need to stand up more often.
0/0	Good. Vaccine hesitancy is the mark of intelligence.
1/1	Good. We will take it!
0/0	Good...no one needs their poison vaccine.
1/1	Goodbye to covid-19! Vaccinated today
1/1	Goodish news so far (for non-South African strains)
1/1	Goodness gracious finally the vaccine is here!!!!
1/1	Goodness. Each vaccine has ALREADY been given to +40,000 people for Human Clinical Trials before it was approved. That's how the percent of effectiveness is known, as well as safety risks, effects, and how each one got approved in the first place.
1/0	Google "disease x" or "virus x". Don't spread misinformation about the vaccine being rushed when you don't have a clue what you're talking about.
0/0/-1	Google is trying to remove or hide all anti vax videos on YT now

1/1	Got J&J...one shot with no side effects!!!
1/1	Got JJ shot a week ago. I was very sick for three days. None of the vax are safe but covid is less safe.
1/1	Got Moderna as well, but only one dose yesterday. Get my 2nd at the end of the month. I was super happy to see all the people there to get vaccinated since I live in a smaller community
1/1	Got Moderna at 10 am for me... glad to do my part. Eff Covid
1/1	Got Moderna vaccine last week, I still walk, talk, no issues so far :) what options do we have, we who work with the public? half patients don`t wear the mask properly or they stick the nose out. I am young 35 yo but I don`t want to depend of others! I got vaccinated I won`t have anxiety when I see them sticking the nose out.

1/1	Got both shots, and am too. I do the same when it comes to Flu season. Though this was to protect myself and my family.
1/1	Got both, minor reactions, better than playing Russian roulette on how I would react to the virus.
1/0	Got covid a year ago, woke up with a slight fever and stuffy nose that lasted 2 days (thought it was just a sinus infection) and only realized a week later when I lost my taste and smell it was covid. Just recently took care of my gf and roommate who both came down with the Delta variant of covid. Didn't even get sick and got tested twice while caring for them to be sure. So remind me why those of us who don't want the vaccine need to be forced to get it to make you happy
0/0	Got covid this month. Stayed away from doctors and hospital. It was a really bad cold. Took the drugs that cam not be named along with vitamins and good food. One week later I am all well.

1/1	Got mine last week. I know it's not going to protect me 100%, but a little is better than nothing, IMO.
1/1	Got mine last weekend. I‚Äôd never gotten it before I was pregnant but then I got the flu after the vaccine during pregnancy. And I decided I really liked not being severely ill. Since covid I‚Äôm actually more pro-vaccine than I ever was before.

1/1	Got my 2nd vaccine shot today. I'm happy I did not catch covid before getting vaccinated. I was tested multiple times, masked up and constantly wash my hands. All of which I will continue to do so. Can't wait to have a lit ass birthday and summer!Partying face

And I'll finally be able to see my parents again after almost a year now that we'll all be vaccinated :)
1/1	Got my Janssen Vaccine today , my arm hurts more than any flu vaccine I have had but small price to pay... think I'm going to try to get the Moderna Vax to, then I'll have an efficacy rating over 100% and then Covid will worry about catching me
1/1/1	Got my Johnson and Johnson vaccine the other day I had arm soreness and felt like I had the flu the next day, but it was definitely worth it to help protect myself and my family. These are the same side effects that I get after a flu shot.

0/0/0	Guys bbc. Cnn. Nbc. Any main stream media is operated by the same rulers that enslave us! No real info will ever come from these. Why would this doctor be removed from youtube if it were false. Its not false. We should not allow ourselves to take this bs vaccine
1/1	Guys don't forget to get vaccinated, it's safe and effective..also wear your mask on daily basis, stay safe.
1/1	Guys don‚Äôt worry, natural selection will do his thing at some point
1/1	Guys if you had the opportunity to get the shot get it. One of my friends' granddaughters is in ICU they just moved her over to ICU and she's a very young and not unhealthy.

0/0	HELL NO I WOULD NOT TAKE IT
0/0	HELL NO...I would rather DIE before I take that nasty deadly vaccine...Don't you people know that vaccines were never ever intended for humans? Vaccines were for animals only, but that's how they think of us, as ANIMALS, we are their animals...go deep into research and find out for yourselves what vaccines are really all about. If you feed your body the right foods you won't need a nasty vaccine...oregano oil, black seed oil, zinc, iodine, krill oil, Molasses, cinnamon etc etc...these are the things our body needs, along with lots of fruits and vegetables...with them our body lacks nothing...I take them every day.....they strengthen your immune system as well as repair any ailments in the body...I was on doctor's prescribed poison for years, I stopped taking them and started taking the above mentioned oils and foods, now I feel so much better, no side effects at all....There's absolutely NO NEED for vaccines, To hell with the nasty deadly vaccines
1/1	HIV's RNA knows how to elude and destroy the immune system (antiretrovirals are miracle drugs that prevent this destruction, but not the eluding). Moderna's mRNA will teach the immune system to ACT UP, FIGHT BACK, FIGHT COVID! /end
1/1	HOORAY FOR SCIENCE!!!!
1/1	HOORAY! Had the phone call and COVID vaccination booked for weekend! Hope I'm not still snowed in by then! Keeps blowing a blizzard, then sun.

1/1	HOW are we supposed to deal with the fckin virus if we dont get vaccinated???
1/1	HOW is this still a question when so many doses already have been given with so few side-effects.
0/0	HUGE WIN! OSHA just withdrew its emergency COVID-19 vaccine mandate for private businesses. This is why we NEVER back down in the face of corruption.
0/0	HUMAN RIGHTS- WE GET TO CHOOSE WHAT WE WISH OR NOT WISH TO DO, INCLUDING VACCINES

1/1	Ha if you only knew how effective vaccines really are. The mom kissing her son made me want to cry. she can kiss her son again
0/0	Ha. This is a joke. Nothing can be determined "safe" with no long-term studies carried out.
0/0	Ha.. yeah, the benefits, (profit) for them outweighs the risk of human lives.... Hmmm .
1/1	Had 2nd does yesterday. Slight fever. Some mild body aches for several hours. I'm feeling almost normal now.
1/1	Had 2nd does yesterday. Slight fever. Some mild body aches for several hours. I'm feeling almost normal now. It's good to feel you immune system kick in to fight the vaccine. I would not want to risk my immune system being overrun by the Covid-19 virus itself.
1/1	Had Astrazeneca 20 days ago. Was ill for 2 days (like a cold). I was told that most ppl get a fever in around 12 hrs and they hit the mark almost in a minute :D Cant wait for the second one to be done with it.
0/0/0	Had Covid, no big deal, body fought it off with no problem. Have the antibodies, need no vaccine.

1/1	Had my first #CovidVaccine jab today, the Pfizer version, feeling great and no side effects at all
1	Had my first #vaccination this morning. I felt so relieved and so grateful that I thought I might cry. I've always loved both science and the NHS, but perhaps never quite so much as over the past year. There really is light at the end of the tunnel for us now, isn't there.
1/1	Had my first COVID Vaccine after placement today ... very grateful
1/1	Had my first Jab about 7 weeks ago, No Pain or Side Effects at all. Everyone Please get their Jabs & help keep all the Rest of the People Safe

1/1	Had my first Moderna shot yesterday at 4pm. Around 11 pm, the vaccination shot site was pretty painful. Now, the next morning, it's definitely worse. Big knot in my arm and visible swelling. I'm glad I was able to get it but not loving life right now.

0/1	Had my first jab Sunday, must admit by Sunday night I had a sore arm but day after felt a little crappy and then yesterday got an itchy arm but other than that I‚Äôm fine.
1/1	Had my first shot of #COVID19 vaccine today.
1/1	Had my first shot yesterday absolutely no side effects ..the 2 shingles vaccines I got last febuary were much worse I definitely had reactions too those ..covid one was a breeze
1/1/1/1	Had my jab last Tueday without hesitation. Our scientists have been positive about the vaccine for a while and I've had, and continue to have, a huge amount of faith in them. Sad to see some European politicans ignoring their own scientitsts and this is damaging the vaccine effort in Europe.
1/1	Had my jab today. Time for us all to get on board. #PfizerBioNTech #covid19 @SwanseabayNHS
1/1	Had my second Oxford Jab yesterday . No probs. 79 and not in the best of health but quite happy to be vaccinated!

0/0	Had no cold before since i was not vaccinated but after i got vaccinated almost 2 months cold is never gone...sad to say regret is too late ....my advice ..no to vaccine
0/0	Had no real problems with vaccines until covid. With so much pressure being brought to bear for such a mild set of symptoms, it was pretty clear there were other not so nice reasons for the shots. Now,,, no shots for me....
1/1	Had our first shot of Phizer two days ago, husband and I have no side effects, not even a sore arm. Both of us didn‚Äôt feel the needle go in. The flu shot gives us a sore arm for a couple of days. Very happy we got it! Can‚Äôt wait for the second dose.

1/1	Had the first shot already - arm felt like it had been punched for a few days. I requested a couple of vacation days for when I get that second shot. If I have flu-like symptoms, I'll tuck in, eat hot soup, doze and watch movies; if not, I'll get my spring cleaning done. Win-win!
1/0	Had to do it‚Ä¶because the government started restricting my freedoms
1/1	Had to go home from work after the second shot but had lab confirmed antibodies the next week
0/0	Hah the news guy said no side affects, lies,many people i knew who took it got all mangled up on side effects, so im glad they are standing up for thier rights

0/-1	Hahaha a few months ago if someone suggested we‚Äôd be having a 4th shot, it would be deleted from social media for misinformation

0/0	Hank Aaron took the vaccine to show the black community it's safe, dies 17 days later after second dose.
0/0	Hank Aaron took vaccine to show black Americans there's nothing to fear. He dead. Why would I take a vaccine for a virus with a recovery rate of 99.7% The only virus is the deep state globalist. Shot in the arm or shot in the head, either way they want you dead.
0/0	Hank Aaron's tragic death is part of a wave of suspicious deaths among elderly closely following administration of #COVID #vaccines. He received the #Moderna vaccine on Jan. 5 to inspire other Black Americans to get the vaccine. #TheDefender
0/0	Hank Arron died 5 days after taking it, and has anyone seen the nurse that passed out on live TV after taking it ?
0/0	Happening all the time now. Wake and listen to those of us who know the true science. Please! The shot does NOT prevent Covid!
1/1/1/1	Happily threw my mask away. Vaccinated and trusting the science.
1/1	Happiness is a completed vaccine package.
1/1	Happiness is when what you think,say and do is in right position, hope we will be safer after getting these vaccines.
1/1	Happy "2 Weeks Post-Second Vaccine" to me!
1/1	Happy Friday everyone. Good news related to most recent nursing home covid data. Cases and deaths are continuing to trend down. Some of the most recent decline may relate to early vaccine efforts in certain states.
1	Happy Sunday. COVID-19 Vaccine 3rd dose done
1/1	Happy and grateful to have gotten 2 shots.
1/1	Happy and relieved to have the #PfizerBioNTech #Covidvaccine ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ amazing work from all at @MHRAgovuk and @NHSuk
1/1	Happy he touched on the value of getting low income countries vaccinated. We can boost all we want but as long as new variants pop up in countries with low vaccine access, we will keep seeing the same story
1/1	Happy news tq u sir upload more news about vaccine
1/1	Happy one year anniversary to me and my vaccine! I had no idea the next year of the pandemic would involve more CDC fuckups, finding out family are antivaxxers, having a relative die of Covid, getting a 3rd shot and being due for a 4th soon, or me being back in lockdown.
1/1	Happy that companies are working together to get these vaccines out safely
1/1	Happy to be 2 weeks out from my second dose!

0/0	Hard pass for me. I‚Äôm not getting the vaccine. I have a God given natural immune system. If I get it, I will do my best to fight it. If not, Jesus take the wheel I‚Äôm heading home.
0/0	Hard pass on a vaccine
0/-1	Hard pass on the vaccine
1/1/1/1/1	Hard to believe but I'm actually excited about this this means that vaccines might be starting to be made the right way now
1/1	Hard to fathom how protesters are opposed to a vaccine that is overwhelming safe and effective to protect their health and their loved ones. Crazy how they want to prolong Covid that will cause illness and death in the Unvaccinated. Get vaxxed and then we can all get back to work
1	Hard to imagine that so few of the health workers in the Ozarks are vaccinated - just imagine going into hospital for a heart attack and catching Covid from your nurse and dying
0/-1	Hard to know the long term side effects if you are only looking 1 to 1.5 years ahead.
1/-1	Has Dr James had the Hepatitis B vaccine which is a requirement of all clinical staff likely to come into contact with blood and body fluids?
0/0	Has anyone actually read up on these "Vaccines" look up how it slices your DNA and mutates it...
1/1	Has anyone been hospitalised or died from Covid after taking the AZN vaccine, either from the trials or since approval? If the answer is No, then the statistic as it stands is correct. If the answer is Yes, please share the link that disproves this.
0/-1	Has anyone mentioned that these so called vaccinations are still on clinical trials until 2022/2023. Surely, if we want to take part that‚Äôs up to us but we shouldn‚Äôt be pushing or encouraging others to participate!!
1/-1	Has anyone tried turning the anti-vaxxers off and turning them back on again
0/0	Has anyone yet mentioned these are not really vaccines, rather they supposedly minimise the effects of COVID if you get it. There is no evidence that if you're vaccinated you don't pass on the disease as supposedly asymptomatic people do. Oh well...
1/1	Has common sense completely yeeted out the window!?
0/0	Has he had the vaccine üíâ? He can have mine for free!
0/0	Has no one ever wondered why it is that the media never seems to mention alternatives to vac cines; like Vitamin b3 and magnesium?(research Vitamin b effect on Cytokine immune system) Why is this so? Censorship? For what purpose? For whose again? People do for self. Grow your own food. hashtag pushback.
0/0	Has the vaccine been tested on pregnant women because the timeline suggests it has not
0/0	Has there been enough testing?
0/0	Has there been enough time to test the side effects?? All this is evil.
0/0	Hasn't been enough time for a reliable study
0/0	Hasnt been out long enough, fda passed it to quickly, well all know 10 years from now when you see commercials on tv stating " if you got the 1st round covid shot, and now have cancer" or (fill in the blank.)
0/0	Hasn‚Äôt been enough time to know what will happen. I‚Äôll pass
1/1	Hate anti vaxers, blame them for the rising cases, selfish pigs
0/-1	Hate needles üò©üò≠
0/0	Hate the fucking mask ‚Äî I‚Äôm very frustrated with the lack of clear scientific explanations or transparency, accountability... A vaccine that is being mass-trialed on the population...
0/0/0/0	Hate the war on drugs, not the people using them. Prohibition hasn‚Äôt prevented drugs from entering the country or people from using them. It‚Äôs actually created more dangerous drugs, overdose, addiction and stigma. The war on drugs isn‚Äôt ending harms, it‚Äôs causing them!
0/0	Hate to be the one to say it but nobody knows whats in those syringes, it could be any shot. Just trying to condition us to take it
0/1	Hats off to those who haven't allowed themselves, or their families, fall victim to the psychopaths behind the plandemic and their needles
0/0	Hats off to those who haven't allowed themselves, or their families, fall victim to the psychopaths behind the plandemic and their needles !
1	Have a great deal of confidence in scientists.
0/-1	Have a jab and be free but I should be free with or without being part of an experiment.
1/0	Have all these fools come work in the hospital with us healthcare workers. See what it‚Äôs actually like on the frontlines. Because the bimbo sitting in her mansion is so out of touch with reality she has no idea what‚Äôs going on. ‚ÄúNo evidence of a pandemic‚Äù
0/0	Have anaphylaxia. Have a list of allergies. My doctor, thank God, says no way Jose. And if she would not have said that, I would have said that on my own. My coworker's mom took the first shot to Pfizer and within 30 seconds after had a code blue heart attack. They revived her. But she was in a coma for 2 weeks as her kidneys and liver began to fail. Some how she survived. But when she woke up, she showed signs of mid-stage Alzhiemers.
0/0	Have doctors forgotten ‚ÄúFirst Do No Harm‚Äù. The way people who have vaccine reactions are being treated is nothing short of disgraceful
1/1	Have had both of mine, feel so relieved. Everybody please get the vaccine so we can get back to some sort of normal.
0/0	Have not taken it nor do I plan on doing so. Gates and his croonies will not be able to add me to the statistics who willingly volunteered to be guinea pigs.
1/1	Have people seen how one mutation, eg the one in England, can affect the population? We need vaccinenation to stop this!
1	Have people seen the caos at the hospitals? All of this can be stopped with vaccination
0/0	Have scientists heard of Natural Selection? Unfortunately there will be deaths from a virus, but our bodies have the ability to fight viruses. It may be hard to swallow, but it‚Äôs the truth. Question: Why can‚Äôt you sue these companies that are making the vaccine?
1/1	Have side effects after getting the #COVID19 vaccine? That‚Äôs normal and a sign that your immune system is responding to protect your body from infection.
1/1	Have the anti-Vaxxers lost their way to this video? Don't see a lot of down votes. I understand some people are allergic to science and make up any anecdote and conspiracy to deny it.
1/1	Have the courage to risk a vaccination - No one who‚Äôs had one hasn‚Äôt been at least a little unsure. We have a chance to get COVID after a vaccination - the only other choice is to get COVID without one.
1/1	Have the life saving vaccine or stay inside forever so you don't potentially infect or kill others . Vaccine equals freedom.
0/-1	Have you been getting any desire to eat brains or has your temperature plummeted recently?
0/0	Have you ever seen a vaccine pushed like this for an illness that has a greater than 99% survival rate? What could this really be about?
0/-1	Have you heard of 37 percent of Americans refusing to take any other vaccine more than 13 months after it became available? Must be a coincidence.
0/0	Have you learned nothing from the 1979 Swine flu debacle?! CDC villains are trying to stop herd immunity so they can mandate a rushed vaccine. What‚Äôs it going to be this time? Paralysis? More autism? More cancer (SV40)? Death? This is nuts!!! Natural herd immunity is best!!!
1/1	Have you never read about how diseases like smallpox, yellow fever and polio have been almost eliminated thanks to vaccines. Why is it whole swathes of society have completely forgotten?
0/0	Have you seen the BBC article with Andrew Marr? He was Double Vaccinated and got Covid (said it was nasty). There is a video in which he spoke to a Doctor who said - the vaccine does not prevent you getting or spreading Covid. He also literally said that we would see more covid cases in the coming months and most would be vaccinated people (perhaps he just meant this as so many people are vaccinated - I am not crying conspiracy here) When you posted this video there was no real data on the effectiveness of the vaccines on preventing transmission. They are only just pulling this together and the claim is it is 40-60% less likely you will transmit. If you are debunking myths it's a little weird that you have given information at a time that seems to have had no backing in evidence...
1/1	Have you seen the pictures of kids in iron lungs because of polio? VACCINES ARE SAFE AND THEY WORK!!!!!!!!
1/1	Have you tried the COVID-19 vaccine? All the cool kids are doing it! ( Just got my first dose of Moderna! )
0/0	Haven't been injected and no regrets as a result. How many who have taken the needle now regret it, lol
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	Haven't been vaccinated in 20 years and haven't been sick in 20 years. That's all the proof I need.

0/0	Haven`t had a jab and don`t intend to have one , the sheep can have it .
0/-1	Haven‚Äôt gotten the vaccine yet, but I did get accepted into a Covid community research study. The biggest side effect I‚Äôve noticed so far is smugness that lingers for several days.
0/0	Haven‚Äôt worn a mask throughout 2020 and nothing is going to change now! As for the vaccine, never happening. I love how big Pharma, big tech, and the government try to incrementally try to take away rights and freedoms, and nobody stands up for what is right?! Come on America!
0/0	Having 100% population vaccinated doesn't end shit. Stop with this blabbering nonsense. If vaccines actually work, there's no need to keep masks, mandates, and other useless stuff. Also, if one is vaccinated and still get infected and spread, then vaccines are not effective!
1/1	Having a hard time squaring how you can be religiously opposed to a Covid vaccine, but took the anthrax, small pox, yearly flu, typhoid, yellow fever, MMR, etc to join and remain in‚Ä¶ and that not have violated your ‚Äúreligion?‚Äù
0/0	Having a strong immune system, not being obses, and taking care of your health is the best way to protect yourself from covid not Vaccine .
1/1	Having a vaccine that is somewhat effective is better than no vaccine at all
1/1	Having an immune system is what makes vaccines work you bad div
1/1	Having finally come down with covid, so grateful to our wonderful NHS and the researchers around the world for the vaccine, and the neutralising monoclonal antibody infusion I received today. Get your vaccines when you can.. even a mild version of covid really sucks
1/1	Having had COVID-19 March during the first wave I‚Äôll happily have the vaccine please
1/1	Having mine tomorrow morning - absolutely no hesitation.
0/0	Having worked in patient record systems, I can attest that adverse reactions are massively underreported
1/1	Having your child vaccinated for COVID can help restore a more normal life
1/-1	He can go back to training now for next years Olympics.
0/0	He didn‚Äôt mention all the ingredients.. it‚Äôs not just water, sugar and fat.. Lies
0/0	He don‚Äôt even vaccinated his kids, why is he giving this poison? Oh I forgot it‚Äôs all about population.
0/0	He even says ...‚Äôacts just like our immune system...‚Äô WE ALREADY HAVE AN IMMUNE SYSTEM, so WHY would we need dirty gates mRNA vaccines , we don‚Äôt, NOT required
0/0	He forgets to mention all the animals they tested it on died
0/0	He got his vaccine so he can still wear his mask and stay 6 feet away from his friends at school
0/0	He has no power whatsoever to make me get vaccinated. I can handle losing my job if it comes to that. Sounds like working for a small business will still be in the cards, anyway. Shouldn't be too difficult to find a small business owner who isn't a blue-pilled piece of shit.
0/-1	He has no symptoms but everyone else has so many weird side affects that are unexplained.
0/0	He is not the only Doctor speaking out plenty off non vaccine doctors across the world are saying No also. Good
1/1	He is willfully refusing the vaccine? If that the case he is putting someone other people at risk and possibly waste a heart. Isn‚Äôt there clauses that alcoholics can‚Äôt receive liver transplants?
0/0	He must be enjoying a great deal of suffering due to side effect of vaccine so he advices other to suffer as well. It is pity that he is still around.
1/1	He probably wouldn‚Äôt be dead if he‚Äôd had the vaccine
0/-1	He said it's less virulent so...why care? Let's just move on
0/-1	He said protect you against sars cov 2?
0/0	He said the vaccine is safe but doesn't care in Norway or other countries people died from the vaccine.
0/1	He said vaccine will help reach herd immunity. So far the articles I have read says that you can still get Covid infection and spread it after you are vaccinated.
0/0	He said we need to trust the vaccine lol coz we can't trust anything they have said so far . Keep your vaccine
1/1	He should get a new job as he clearly does not care about people when not wantig to get vaccinated. So work somewhere else..
0/0	He wants me to risk getting some similar issue because misery loves company. I am unvaccinted and untested and haven't been sick for years. Misery loves company.
1/1	He was smart to get something to protect himself. The vaccine has helped millions. Not dying was the whole point.Having a bad cold is different.
0/0	He's a doctor who understands "immune escape" and the problems that can arise with mass vaccination campaigns. He also knows this is gene therapy and not a vaccine, yet he's on the news wanting everyone to get "vaccinated" with an experimental intervention. THIS IS EVIL AT ITS FINEST. Look at his dead eyes, there is no soul with a moral compass in there.
0/0	He's absolutely right I know so many people that have been vaccinated that have covid and so many would have not been vaccinated do not have covid
1/1	He's lucky to have his vaccine, I'm at risk, I'm 59 years old and I don't have a vaccine, bravo!!!!
0/-1	He's not an essential worker! Back of the line joe
1/0	He's not anti vaccine, he's just not sure of the long term effects of the vaccine. It takes years to determine that.
0/0	He's not that stupid to get vaccinated. Everybody knows that Nadal wouldn't have one if there was integrity in sport and he was allowed to play. He'll go down as the greatest tennis player for making a stand against the biggest scamdemic of all time.
0/0	He's not the ony one to die. I will never get that vaccine !
1/1	He's right about that but every Christian should be responsible and take the approved vaccines to save lives
1/1	Heads up, naysayers: the vaccine is working. Hope at last!
0/0	Health cannot be injected.
1/1	Health care professionals still maintain that the people crowding up our hospital are the unvaccinated.
0/0	Health care worker dies after second dose of #COVID #vaccine.
1/1	Health care worker here. Words can't describe how happy I am! This is one of the greatest scientific achievements of the century and I can't wait to get the vaccine once it comes out!
1/1	Health care workers have courageously stepped up and have worked around the clock on the front lines and have born the brunt of caring for and watching over half a million people die from this scourge. They have been simply heroic in putting their own lives and loved ones lives in jeopardy for over a year. And they have cared for everybody no questions asked about ignoring mask mandates and gathering in large groups. Any sick person is cared for by these folks. We all owe it to these scientists and honorable professionals to get the vaccine so they don't have to continue to work around the clock and try to save people from dying. It won't end until 70% of Americans are vaccinated.
1/1	Health doesn‚Äôt come in the form of a vaccine. It literally does though?
1/1	Health experts generally agree that the mixing and matching of the vaccines should be safe.
1/1	HealthAccessTp explains no shortcuts were taken to approve #CovidVaccines. Pfizer & Moderna trials had proper sample sizes of 30,000 individuals each. Side effects were properly monitored for 60-days during the trial period. Millions have now been vaccinated, let's celebrate.
1/1	Healthcare professionals and care home staff were among the first cohorts to get the vaccine and have barely suffered serious secondary effects.
0/0	Healthcare workers know better than anyone the truth about the virus, they don‚Äôt see a dire need for a vaccine.
0/0	Healthy but unjabbed have to be fined while the jabbed can go around catching and freely passing convid around. Yes, that definitely makes perfect sense.
0/0/0	Healthy immune systems do not require, rushed unproven vaccines.
0/0	Healthy kids didn't need the vaccines either
0/0	Healthy nurse (35) gets encephalitis after Pfizer vaccine and dies. She was previously given Pfizer's corona vaccine. When Rachel McKinney came across as confused and struggling to talk, she was sent to hospital. There, a scan showed that she had inflammation in the brain.
1/1	Healthy people taking the vaccine allows for people with compromized immune systems to live normal lives. Stop beeing so selfish people!
0/0	Hearing that the person got Transverse myelitis and paralysis of hands and feet. It would not be the first time that these type of sars vaccine had that side effect. We have to wait
0/0	Hearing that the vaccine mandate had been banned in Missouri is so good to hear'
0/0	Heart Inflammation cases reported from covid-19 vaccines in Australia in only 2 days. 44 cases, 29 of those under the age of 40. One case aged 15 (female) this is unforgivable
0/0	Heartbreaking. 23 people died within days of 1st Pfizer dose. 13 deaths due to common reactions, incl. fever/nausea, ‚Äúmay have contributed to fatal outcome in some frail patients".
0/0	Heavier period, bloodclots, heart attacks, or death... am I missing anything? https://t.co/EphRnGnjTE
0/0	Heck No!!!!!
0/0	Heck No!!!!! I dont trust that vaccine
0/0	Heck no that shot is useless
0/0/0	Heck no you should not get it. It is full of harmful chemicals. This has all been planned to get chemicals into us. They want to destroy our bodies.
0/0/0	Heeeeell no don‚Äôt take it lol
0/0	Heeeeell no don‚Äôt take it lolüëÅ
1/1	Held off until I fully recovered from COVID, but I got my 1st dose of the vaccine today!!!
0/0	Hell NO !
0/0	Hell if I get a shot just for the card. I haven't gotten any shot, and I'm still virus free.
0/0	Hell if they'd just admit it's a bioweapon and tell us the truth about what it was engineered to do and why in the light of that info this particular type of mrna treatment is necessary it would be a completely different story. But as it stands I don't feel anyone is telling the truth and speaking plainly. They're keeping us in the dark and feeding us shit like we are mushrooms. So, considering, I believe best course of action is do nothing.
0/0/0/0	Hell na I'm no test subject for your "vaccine" your not sure about that will truly work with out messing up my health I'll rather die then be a lab rat for your experiments flock that sht
0/0	Hell naw the government play to many Games with our lives.. I'm not taking it. üò†
0/0/0/0	Hell naw, doctors and nurses have already died taking the vaccine. I‚Äôll stick to social distancing and boosting my immune system. No no and no
0/0	Hell no ! ! !
0/0	Hell no .They couldn't pay me to take it.
0/0	Hell no my body my choice! Don‚Äôt trust any of them!!!
0/0	Hell no to vaccination
0/0	Hell no we will not comply
1/0	Hell no! I would never give it to my 10 month old!! Nor would I give it to my other kids. My children are not experiment‚Äôs
0/0	Hell no. It's unsafe and only reduces systems.
0/0	Hell with the vaccine I know a few people who have died from symptoms of the vaccine also think about long term effects of health of the vaccine..... think before getting the vaccine everyone
0/0	Hell with the vaccine I know a few people who have died from symptoms of the vaccine also think about long term effects of health of the vaccine..... think before getting the vaccine everyone .Plz
1/1	Hell ya! Can't wait to get vaccinated and go travel again.
1/1/1	Hell yeah. Me and the wife are fully vaccinated thanks to Pottawatomi tribe. Boomer Sooner.
1/1	Hell yes I'm getting my freedom shot! I can't wait to stop worrying that a trip to the grocery store could be the death of me or a family member
0/0	Hell yes! Since the WHO declared war on anyone who wants freedom to decide what goes into their family's bodies this has become more important than ever. Thank you for giving us a voice!
1/1	Hello I hope the UK and Europe will get better and I hope the vaccine will keep on going
1/1	Hello I hope the vaccine will work all over the UK
0/0	Hello The vaccine does not protect you from getting covid!
1/1	Hello everyone am from airzona am thinking of getting the vaccine should i get it or not am kinda nervous üò∂ has anybody gotten it yet what the symptoms
1/1	Hello sir. I have been watching you since the beginning of this madness, and I finally got my vaccine yesterday. In our state in the US, they opened up the age range to 16 and over. Felt a little under the weather for a few days but I finally feel like there is an end now. Whew!
0/0	Hello! I am not super eduated on this topic as I've not taken a biology course in years, however, I am concered about any long-term effects the vaccine can have especially because unlike other vaccines, this vaccine has not had years of research to determine any possible long term effects
0/-1	Hello! I am not super eduated on this topic as I've not taken a biology course in years, however, I am concered about any long-term effects the vaccine can have especially because unlike other vaccines, this vaccine has not had years of research to determine any possible long term effects.
1/1	Hello! I was waiting for you information on this vaccine. Thank you, always appreciate the science and research that you convey in your videos. Greetings from South Florida....
1/1/1/1	Hello, and thanks for this video! I'm a health care worker and have had all my vaccinations thus far, but have become a vaccine sceptic, due to being bombarded by the anti vaxx narrative. But, also, I must admit, it didn't help my scepticism the way that the government has imposed vaccinations on us so aggressively, I believe it should be a choice, not forced onto us. Anyways, I'm going to finally book my first vaccine shot this week, after seeing your video. I've had enough of the conspiracy theories and all the surrounding bs.
0/0	Hells NO!!!!
0/0	Hells NO!!!! I aint taking no shot
1/1	Help protect your whole family and slow the spread of COVID-19 in your community by getting yourself and your children ages 5 years and older vaccinated against COVID-19.
0/0	Hence the adverse reactions. Everyone√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s genetic make up differs. This nano tech can deduce each one. I think not. Common sense
1/1	Her being against vaccines because she had a bad reaction, is like someone say is against exercise and is bad for you, because she sprained her ankle once.
1/1	Her research that started 10+ years ago has lead to the science that developed the MessengerRNA which is how Pfizer & Moderna were able to be developed in record time......Thank you for your work that is saving lives!
1	Herd immunity doesn't require vaccinations yes, but it's better it we do achieve herd immunity through vaccines. Also, they have been proven safe.
0/-1	Herd immunity exists through vaccination, there is no vaccine for COVID-19. Second, this is a corona virus, we don‚Äôt typically see vaccines for corona viruses, because you can contract them over and over again, like the common cold. Getting it once does not make you immune.
1/1	Herd immunity for the win
0/1	Herd immunity is great if it's through vaccines. Herd immunity without immunisation is just letting everyone get infected. Literally no rational person can find logic in that.
1/0	Herd immunity is our way out of this crisis!
1/1	Herd immunity is so important! Everyone should get vaccinated!
0/0	Herd immunity is when you have IMMUNITY. None of the vaccines help with this because they DO NOT offer immunity! Immunity means ZERO breakthrough cases not 1,000's per day!
0/1	Herd immunity to me is a delegation of one's responsibility of his wellbeing to others. That's basically what it is; regardless if a drug works or not. And that's insanity at its finest point having someone to blame others for his immune being grounded. It's unbelievable.
0/0/0	Herd immunity. You need the young and healthy to get herd immunity. The Mrna vaccine is giving people covid. This was always about the vaccine and getting it out as a human trial a experiment. For most people this is 99.8% survivable so only the diseased and elderly need extra protection. However, this lockdown and destruction of our lives and our currencies and our continued TYRANY from leaders is not tolerable. GIVE IVERMECTIN or GIVE HCQ NOW along with zinc and D and stop this terrorism of the people NOW!
1/1	Herd-immunity is the only way to fight the virus, take the vaccine
0/0	Here are my concern. These vaccine giants are owned by business people(Pfizer, AstraZeneca, moderna and etc) meaning they only care about profits instead of health. 2nd the government lied to us so much that it's really sickening for example the food pyramid,the 5 senses of the tongue, heck we don't even know where the Spanish flu came from but no they have to censor it. 3rd the CIA is for sure backing up these to torture people. Hello Tuskegee experiment? Anyone ?. Doctor if you can manage to answer my concerns it would be nice . Lastly. How did they eradicate the Spanish flu ? So if we did it before even when the vaccine wasn't even available at that time don't you think we can do it now ? Especially if our technologies got advanced more ? Doctor if you can manage to answer my concerns I would be happy. If my concerns get deleted then know it wasn't me and that is very concerning.
1/-1	Here in Bosnia I had already seen several cases of rheumatic fever and a case we thought was miliary tuberculosis, diseases now rare in America. It was sobering to think that the mundane process of vaccinating these children might ultimately save more lives than any UN-brokered peace treaty.
1/0	Here in Brexitland we need a vaccine against the far-right taking over. Then we can ditch brexit and get back some humanity instead of all this populist 'euro-hate'.
0/0	Here in DRC,we don't like vaccination,we will not die whith covid19, Jesus Christ is protecting us from that
1	Here in brazil people think that the vaccine will turn humans into aligators lol üòÇüòÇüòÇ
1/1	Here in tanzania I lost many relatives myself cause of the pandemic even recently despite the government denying covid many ppls familys have been affected by it very badly
0/0	Here is a great idea. You do you and I'll do me and you can do the vaccine if you want it and I will not if I don't want it. Free choice!
1/1	Here is a great reason to get vaccinated. Long Covid otherwise known as Post Covid Syndrome or Long Haul Covid doesn‚Äôt go away. I got Covid in March of 2020 and have been almost completely incapacitated for 22 months now. It would be wonderful if you made a similar short documentary on the people not getting better for years.
0/0	Here is a reason to be cheerful: Covid is done and we dont need anymore vaccines.
0/0	Here is how this pandemic of corona virus works: 1- medical billionaires with scientist create a virus in labs 2- they release the virus 3- they make a vaccine 4- they urge gov to sell the vaccine 5- they make billions by making everyone get a vaccine
0/1	Here is my updated information on the facts and myths about the various COVID-19 vaccines. It makes it easier to deal with one of those anti-vaccine tropes. Let's be clear. All of the data shows that the vaccine is safe and effective.
0/1	Here is what you need to know, it has a lesser survival rate than Covid itself. Continue on!
0/0	Here we are now with more questionable deaths after the shot~~. #RIPHAGLER #RIPAARON
0/0	Here we are witnessing us humans being tested like Guinea pigs :| (Dont get the vaccine)
0/0	Here we go with the FoxNews push to keep driving the fork deep into the right wingers souls with news of souls lost to COVID to better suit their agenda. LOOK JELLYFISHES, THEY WERE FULLY VACCINATED! Don‚Äôt do it. RESIST. and the mass of idiots believe it‚Ä¶
1/1	Here we go! Grateful to be among the first group of vaccinated healthcare workers in Tampa
1/-1	Here's a fact: current death toll in excess of 5.5 million. Imagine standing over a crowd of 6 million dying people and flipping them off... that's anti-vax, that's anti-mask, that's the real USA.
0/1	Here's a fun search for Google How many people have died from covid virus vaccine world wide" You can't get a answer üò≠
0/0	Here's a personal anecdote of mine: once my grandma was turned into a rocket because of the Tetanus vaccine. She ended up flying away to live a better life. After she reached outer space and said her goodbyes, the government counted her as a covid death
1/1	Here's a simple way of thinking about it: fully vaccinated means well protected, not fully protected. Continuing to simplify: 95% protection is certainly not 100%, but just a wee bit better than 0%. Similar examples in dealing with risk are everywhere: some nonsmokers do get lung cancer, but the chance of that is way higher among smokers. Seatbelts provide excellent protection against many types of automobile accident injury (e.g., ejection), but some people die with their seatbelts on. And so on. Why do supposedly intelligent people have so much difficult dealing with relative risk in our society for COVID vaccination, when they deal with it constantly in their daily lives?
1/1	Here's a thought, the last time there was a pandemic this dangerous, they had no vaccines and had to go the herd immunity route. 30 million people died and that without the modern transport infrastructure and a world population far less than it is now. So, anti-vaccers, my question would be what would an acceptable final death tally be for you?
1/1	Here's hoping everyone who can will get this vaccine! Who wouldn't want to reduce their chances of serious illness?
1/1	Here's my @PostOpinions op-ed on the Johnson & Johnson #covid19 #vaccine pause. Biggest takeaway: I hope that people feel even more reassured about vaccine safety, because they see how quickly, carefully & transparently our regulatory agencies are.
0/0/0	Here's the reason I'll refuse to take it, and it didn't dawn on me until just last night: How were we able to come up with a vaccine for a brand new disease in 9 months, yet scientists have been trying to centuries (and still haven't succeeded) to find a cure for cancer?
0/0	Here's the reasons I'll never get the vaccine. 1) c19 data isn't scary 2)I don't trust big pharma and their paid Scientists. Especially when they, big tech and the media ban other Scientists from speaking 3) The constant lies from corrupt Scientists and politicians 4)I'm not 75 with heart and lung issues. Cheers
0/0	Here's the short answer to should you get vaccinated? NO!
1/1	Here's what I think of anti-vaxxers: ‚ÄúIf they would rather die, they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.‚Äù
0/0	Here's why I can't compare them, cause I won't be taking any of them...more fear mongering & J&J pushing for acceptance of their magical elixir along with the other companies' magical elixirs so they can get paid too...they can't get their share of the fear mongering market they've created if people look at their efficacy rating & don't understand why the other magical elixirs could be, in theory at the very least, equally ineffective as their magical elixir...makes perfect sense when you think about it...
0/0	Heres another reason i wont take it...#stop #VaccineSideEffects
0/0	Heresy in 21 century. One cannot ask questions about pfizer vaccine. It actually says a lot. A silence louder than words....
1/1	Here‚Äôs a thought: listen to the real doctors and scientists. Go get vaccinated!!!!
1/1	Here‚Äôs the deal: Unvaccinated individuals are 97 times more likely to die compared to those who are boosted. Protect yourself and those around you by getting vaccinated and boosted today.
1/1	Here‚Äôs the thing though. If everyone decided to not get a vaccine over the 1 in a million risk or whatever, the chance of getting COVID in the next few years is probably north of 50% since it wouldn‚Äôt go away. Not getting a vax over side effect concerns is very selfish. It‚Äôs basically ‚Äúeveryone else take the 1 in a million risk and I‚Äôll reap the benefits of herd immunity‚Äù
1/1	Here‚Äôs to all the morons that think that COVID is a hoax üëè Why is it so damn hard to just follow the rules? Wear a mask, social distance. Let‚Äôs stop the spread and hope that 2021 is much better than 2020.
0/0	Here‚Äôs what parents should know DON‚ÄôT LET THEM DO IT!.
1/1	Here‚Äôs your daily reminder: take whatever vaccine you are offered. Pfizer, Moderna, AZ, J&J- they‚Äôre all good & being regulated. You‚Äôd rather have the vaccine than COVID, and vaccines are a major part of how we end this crisis & return to mixing/socialising & an open economy.
0	Heros! Sadly they were incarcerated because they were selling FREEDOM aka vaxx card
0/-1	Hes actually an ai
0/0	Hesitant ? As they should be.
0/0	Hesitant?I'm down right terrified
1/1	Hey #ConvoyToCanberra people, with banners saying ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt put vaccine poison in my body,‚Äù it‚Äôs nearly a year since I had the vaccine. That‚Äôs a pretty slow-acting poison. When can I expect to feel some negative effects? So far all that I‚Äôve noticed is not getting covid.
1/1	Hey COVID19, we will bid you goodbye soon.
0/0	Hey Mr. Pfizer CEO?? if the vaccines are so safe, why is your company immune from liability?
1/-1	Hey conspiracy theorists, please stop.
0/0	Hey could they not create one with were side effects. Fine if you are retired and not working the rest of us have to plan time off to cope
1/1	Hey everyone good news the Moderna & Pfizer vaccines are actually working with no bad reaction so far!! To all the smart intelligent people get vaccinated! Those who don‚Äôt believe in vaccine keep doing you. Just stay home when you get sick. And..RIP
1/1	Hey everyone, I'm gonna take the vaccine üòò
1/1/1/1/1	Hey everyone, let's all laugh at the antivax boomers in the comments who are disliking the video! Laugh at the clowns!
1/1	Hey fella speaking as a health care pro i would just like to say im all for vax just the RIGHT VAX with no added nasties that all
0/0	Hey get ya free experimental gene therapy poison that has never been tried on humankind before. Limited edition ... step right up !?
0/0	Hey guys, I'm new here. Is it a joke or physological test made by government or people are actually stupid enough to believe this "science"?
1/1	Hey it's like all those scientist were right.
0/0	Hey look! More fake juice requiring 50 booster shots.
0/0	Hey riddle me this , if your vax does not stop you from catching and or passing it how is it slowing down the spread , I'll tell you it's not that's a fact . It's fine to take it in my mind why not if you want to risk your life go ahead . But for me no . And simply because it does not stop the spread . Does any one get that . You can still get it and pass it and that's a fact period . Your not saving anyone by getting it . Only yourself that a solid selling point . But it's a risk again , covid can kill you too . So it's a hard one in my mind
1/1	Hey so I decided to get the COVID vaccine yesterday I‚Äôm okay my arm is a little sore but it will go away but I feel great with no side effects
0/1	Hey y'all I cried when I got the vaccine because I'm a big crybaby that's is still scared of needle's (they used the baby needle too)
0/0	Hey! Did you know Vaxxines are filled with endocrine disrupters? That means it effects your testes and ovaries and impairment of fertility!
1/1	Hey, I am no doctor or any of that but those people may have died of something else. Even if they did die of the vaccine, it is just a small minority of them and you'll be very unlikely to die from it. Hey, I took the vaccine and I survived! My 2nd vaccine is today.
1/0	Hey, if he is willing to die over the vaccine, that is his choice
0	Hey. Go to the real user experience , I got my immune system weakened after 1st dose of vaccine . I am catching flue , tonsillitis , colds faster than ever .
1/-1	He‚Äôs been anti mass vaccination from the start of people getting vaccinated for this. Every blip he sees that possibly supports his position immediately goes to his feed. I stopped following because it became too much. Like the boy who cried bad vaccines.
0/0	He‚Äôs got greater risk of myocarditis from the shot than he does risk from Covid. Congrats I guess?
1/1	He‚Äôs now a spokesman for why you should be vaccinated.
0/-1	He‚Äôs probably getting a placebo- anyway why should we be coerced by media personalities?
1/-1	He‚Äôs saying educated populations are pro-vaccination.
0/0/0	Hi Doc.: Will you guarantee that I will not die, or have health complications, after the vaccination... in writing?
1/-1	Hi Dr. Cellini! Thank you for that info.
0/0/0/0	Hi Guardian. I took all the necessary vaccines in my life, yet I refuse to take a vaccine that has not been thoroughly tested. Does that make me an anti-vaxxer? Can you label someone who has already been vaccinated willingly many times, but is being sceptical about a specific vaccine an "Anti-Vaxxer"?
1/1	Hi I need to get an AstraZeneca Booster
1/0	Hi Im Jai and I worked a six hour shift with adverse side effects of the covid vaccine

1/1	Hi John thankyou for this update i had my 1st Astra zenica vaccine 2 weeks ago I'm a 50 year old lady. I have felt alot of anxiety recently over this blood clot problem. You have helped me to understand and to put it in to context . I feel better for your help thankyou so much for all you do for us . It's truly appreciated as always love Tracey Buckinghamshire England Xxx
1/1	Hi John. Im in Ireland and got my booster this evening. Happy to report my vaccinator obliged when I asked if he would aspirate me needle. Thanks for all your thoughtful and considered advice
1/1	Hi WHO thanks for your Important information about Vaccination of Covid 19.
1/1	Hi y‚Äôall! I personally received the vaccine and I made a video about my day and my experience! If this is something that y‚Äôall are interested in come check it out and subscribe for updates!
1/1	Hi! COVID ICU nurse here! Thank you so much for making this video, it is so important to address all the absolute ridiculous misinformation out there. Had my second dose of Pfizer over a week ago, felt a little flu-like for 24 hours, and since then I‚Äôve been 100% fine. I am so thankful to have been able to be vaccinated and hope once it is available to the general public they will be grateful too
1/1	Hi, I received my vaccine yesterday, AstraZeneca, I'm feeling a bit roppy today but I'm ok ‚ù§üëç
0/0	Hi, I won't take that shit, does anyone have a problem with that???
1/1	Hi, i have stiff person syndrome and have taken Rituxan IV. I had the Maderna both shots all I had was a a little rash at the injection site and weakness I have been a medic for 30 years and I am very educated. I say for those who are afraid of getting the shot my opinion is get the shot.
1/1	Hi, l am 71yrs old and had my second vaccine and so did my husband and we have had no pain at all , so everyone can stop worrying, go get that shot .
1/1	Hi, this video is amazing (going to use it to explain vaccines to my mom). I would just appreciate it if you could write an update in the bio or something? Like which types of vaccines are the new covid vaccines and the thing I am most interested in is: what are the dangers!? I don't feel like any videos highlight the dangers of each? (I want to reassure my mom that we will not die/ become autistic lol).
1/1	Hi. I had a blood clot during pregnancy. And I would still take the J&J vaccine. Nothing in life is without risk, especially pregnancy or pregnancy w/ COVID.
0/0	High amount of vit. C, Zinc and Vit. D. And you'll be fine.
1/1	High vaccination coverage in a population reduces the spread of the virus and helps prevent new variants from emerging
1/1	Higher % of unvaccinated people end up in hospitals which puts a strain on the healthcare system which then lends itself to lockdowns and other restrictions.
1/-1	Highest rate of vaccinations in the world. Also highest transmission rate in the world. But just don't question the narrative.
1/-1	Highly specific delivery of antigens to target cells and high expression of antigen after vaccination
0	His body, his choice, his LIFE , say no to mRna gene therapy
0/0	Historical or not, the use of cells from a baby that was murdered is immoral.
1/1	Historically the vast majority of the vaccines have help the humanity, why do so many have trust issues?
0/0	History has shown us that doctors, scientists, researchers have gotten it wrong. What will the #CovidVaccine show us 10 years from now?
1/1	History in the making - vaccinated and it feels so good!
1/1	History shows doctor the vaccines do work vaccines do wipe out pandemics ignore the haters.
0/0	Hitler experimented with kids which vaccine to find was better to enact viruses Luke Chinese viruses. Even in argentina Hitler experimented with kid abandoned kids, pope Francis was a Hitler solider guard of the gates in Argentina.
1/1	Hm best way to vaccinate non vaxxers is to just stab them with the syringes
0/-1	Hmm so because most of us are carrying a smartphone, that is reason enough to let government run roughshod over privacy and individual rights? And by the time a vaccine passport even comes out, we would already be herd immune.
1/1	Hmm, how about getting the vaccine before you end up in the hospital?
1/-1	Hmm, there seems to be no sign of intelligent life anywhere...
0/0	Hmmm 99.7 % Survival rate 80 % asymptomatic roughly a 30% initial herd immunity for corona. Why the vaccine and why the rush?
0/0	Hmmm let me see Covid 19 , 99.95 survival rate no vaccine for me
0/0	Hmmm, New Zealand doctor, says his study finds nanotechnology in vaccines.

0/-1	Holy Moses, this must be stopped before all of our natural immunsystem closes down by the gene theraphies. God save the people
1/-1	Holy shit... So if a fourth wave doesn't happen, then when can we expect to be back to normal? Haven't gotten mine yet so not sure on everything
0/-1	Home of the free, as long as you do what they say.
0/0	Honestly I ve never met anyone who thinks they re injecting us with microchips in real life. But I do know several doctors and nurses that are wary of this vaccine since it s so rushed and untested. There is literally no way to know if there are long-term side effects right now.
0/0	Honestly I‚Äôm very worried about This vaccine. We were rushing to make this vaccine and it was ready in less then a year which is too fast and we should have waited more to see the after affect of the vaccine.
1/1	Honestly antivaxers not only endanger themselves but also the others as well with their stupidity‚Ä¶
1	Honestly can‚Äôt understand how there could be people on my TL who are still unvaccinated‚Ä¶I waited months for a vaccine & was so excited to get it. My daughter, a #Swiftie, is an ICU nurse‚Ä¶I take it very personally!! Please get vaccinated, don‚Äôt put it off.
1/1	Honestly it‚Äôs worth it to get the covid vaccine just for the tiny little crumb of socialized medicine
1/0	Honestly not taking the vaccine is irresponsible because it puts others in danger.
1/1	Honestly preventing a severe case is what we need. Eradication isn‚Äôt realistic at this point.
0/0	Honestly this proves to me that the politicians are total scumbag criminals because I‚Äôve had much worse. No one needs vaccines for this
1/1	Honestly though. Pro vax people (like myself) trust them because of the good risk assessment ratios. If it‚Äôs 99% reliable, I will be more focused on that 99% than that other 1%
0/0	Honestly wouldn't be surprised if covid was literally only spread by the vaccine.
0/-1/0	Honestly you'd better hope they tested it and it doesn't have any drawbacks once they give it to people. If it's safe for everyone regardless of genes, go ahead then.
0/0	Honestly, I prefer to get COVID-19 again. Those were my covid symptoms for one day. Looks like the vaccine is worse than the virus itself
0/0	Honestly, I think I'd rather have covid than guillain-barr√© syndrome from the vaccine
0/0	Honestly, I will never get the vaccine. Not because it doesn't work but because it's just ignorant. It's like putting a cast on your knee because you scratched it up when you fell. A simple scratch isn't nearly serious enough to get a cast. Same for the virus, a simple cold isn't enough for a vaccine. I just can't wait until the vaccine is available to everybody so that I can't be blamed for giving people the virus.
0	Honestly, I'd rather risk getting the virus and building my own antibodies.
0/0	Honestly, I'd rather risk getting the virus and building my own antibodies. Humans aren't guinea pigs and regardless of what you say here, plenty of bad side effects have been reported.
0/0	Honestly, I'd rather risk getting the virus and building my own antibodies. So many side affects of the vaccine
1/1	Honestly, a few minutes ago, i had this similar argument with someone. I discussed about the fuctions of vaccines in general and how the immune system works, etc. He threw some religious BS argument (that God created the our perfect immune system, etc. Im not against religion btw) and, what i surmised, are conspiracy theories, etc. As a nurse, and as a health care provider, its frustrating coz his kind of mind-set, his thinking, is making it hard for us (health care workers) to educate the public.
1/1	Honestly, as someone with high functioning autism, I find it genuinely insulting that people think that vaccines cause autism. Like. Come on bro. You think I am who I am because i got the MMR ...I got that vaccine after being diagnosed. Your move
1/1	Honestly, been waiting for this vaccine since freaking March, when we all got shut down
1/1	Honestly, even as a republican, shut the actual fuck up and just take the shot
1/1	Honestly, i understand the anti vaccines side, but saying that these vaccines are unsafe is not true, its safe depending on if you have a certain reaction to them, or not.
1/-1	Honestly, i understand the anti vaccines side, but saying that these vaccines are unsafe is not true, its safe depending on if you have a certain reaction to them, or not. And if you are safe but still dont use them because of this reason... It doesnt make any sense since you're not affected.
1/1	Honestly, it's the first time in forever that everyone around me is cautiously optimistic about life. The relief of living normally again will probably cause me to cry.
1/1	Honestly, just make it required for everything. The government requiring it where they can, and insurers making everyone else require it.
1/1	Honestly, this situation makes me MORE confident in the COVID vaccines in general.
1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1	Honestly, when the Coronavirus vaccine becomes available I‚Äôm going to be so happy. The disease killed my grandfather and if I can stop another family from going through the same pain then I‚Äôm down.
0/0	Honestly, you can‚Äôt. Why? Because of who makes them - pharmaceutical companies. Ever watch ads on tv for new drugs? The list of side effects is longer than your arm and much worse than what the drug is supposed to be curing in the first place! It is in their best interest to keep us all sick for as long as possible. It‚Äôs how they make their money. If you think I‚Äôm lying or paranoid or just crazy, do a little research of your own. There are a few links below to help you get started. Pharmaceutical companies have been injuring people for decades. They‚Äôve paid billions in damages and keep putting the same harmful drugs on the market (with the FDA‚Äôs approval) year after year after year. Do you ever wonder why there are so many diabetic drugs available? 90% of the time diabetes can be completely controlled and even cured with a proper diet. But there‚Äôs no money in that! Obviously it‚Äôs better to take costly injections on a daily basis along with buying meters and lancets and test strips than to eat right! ü§¶‚ôÄÔ∏è Doctors used to use a lot of natural remedies and they worked. But since drug makers have figured out how much money is at stake, doctors are no longer taught what natural remedies even are. A very large chunk of their education is sponsored by drug companies. They teach doctors how to write prescriptions for drugs that will make them (pharmaceutical companies) boat loads of money. Every doctor knows that losing weight and changing your diet can have a tremendous impact on many common diseases: diabetes, heart disease, allergies, etc., but instead of advising you regarding diet, they would rather write a prescription. And if you think doctors don‚Äôt get kick backs and incentives to push certain drugs, you‚Äôre naive. Because they do! How many commercials have you seen from attorneys with a phone number like 1‚Äì800-BAD-DRUG? I‚Äôm in the US and can‚Äôt hardly watch 5 minutes of tv without seeing at least one commercial for a class action suit because of drugs that harm people. Look at Montesano, the manufacturer of Round Up. They‚Äôve known for decades that their weed killer causes cancer but they keep using it - on crops that grow our foods! No one has slapped their hands and said they can‚Äôt do that. Johnson & Johnson used asbestos in their baby powder for decades, knowing full well it causes cancer. Now they‚Äôre making one of the vaccines? No thanks, I‚Äôll pass. If you truly want the truth, it‚Äôs out there. Do your own research. Listen to all sides and make up your own mind.
1/1	Hooligans. I know it feels like ancient advice at this point, but, keep wearing masks while maintaining social distancing. Get vaccinated and boosted. Get that flu shot, too. Stay smart. Stay healthy. I want you around.

As we watch and wait there "RARE" will not be so rare because there will be more deaths. They don't report the deaths to us just the rare ones.

0/0	How can we rule out any adverse effects that may appear in the long run? My understanding is that all vaccines normally undergo human trials for a period of 5-10 years before being made available to the public, but this wasn't the case with COVID vaccines due to the emergency situation.

Stop trying to pretend covid poses a huge risk of death. It doesn't and it didn't, not even at the height of waves.

0/-1	How he chatted the guy! Thanks to the doctor who injected him with a Placebo album. In your Pfizer puck. What are you going to do Micron?
1/1	How i wish this vaccine will available soon philippines
1/-1	How ironic that everyone wanted a vaccine so we can get back, now everyone doesn‚Äôt want to take the vaccine.
0/0	How is Bill Gates more qualified to talk about vaccines than Jenny McCarthy? It's certainly not due to his medical degree or even college degree (he possesses neither). Why are we allowing a billionaire eugenicist to shape global health policy?
0/0	How is a vaccinated person more immune than a person who have contracted the disease once and recovered from it?
1/1	How is anyone still anti vax?? Pls don‚Äôt say that out loud bc it‚Äôs embarrassing
0/0	How is it that getting the vax means care for others when the vaccinated are still spreading the virus? There have been materially no changes in the rate of Covid cases or Covid death since the vaccine was released. If anything it‚Äôs gotten worse.
0/0	How is that legalized poison working out for you now?
0/0	How is the vaccine safe after 4 years olds are having heart attacks?!
1/0/-1	How is this surprising if the vaccines efficacy rate is at most 95% after 2 doses? The vaccines are not going to protect you completely and there is little known (and it's changing daily it seems) of the vaccines effectiveness against the variants.
0/0	How is this surprising? The government is just going to keep lying to too many Americans. I will not get this vaccine. Ever. I will be better off without it or the other ones.

0/0	How many people have been harmed by these toxic things? I bet hundreds of thousands and we are just starting to see the slow effects.

0/0/0	How much mercury, aluminum, aborted fetal cells, formaldehyde, polysorbate 80, and MSG will be in the covid vaccine?
0/0	How much money are they making! They should donate it to the people with adverse reactions to it.
0/0	How much money are you putting into coercing people into taking this experimental medication. People have immune systems they do not need to become lab rats to protect them from a virus with a 99%+ survival rate. Are you informing them they are part of a clinical trial or of any of the MANY severe adverse reactions taking place? Shameful propaganda!
1/1	How much vaccine the government currently has should be irrelevant to the calculation. We are going to need a whole lot more vaccine than the government currently has.
0/0	How much you want to bet that if people stopped getting these shots covid would go away pretty quick.
0/0	How naive the world is, this isn‚Äôt a vaccine, it just takes us to the hell
0/0	How odd that mandates are being made for "vaccines" that are not really vaccines, not fully tested for the mandatory length of time and to add are now obsolete in the face of the new variants. The govt is forcing its population to take experimental prescription drugs, and drug pushing is actually still a crime!
0/0/-1	How on Earth most medical "professionals" can call all of these cases a coincidence is beyond me! It's a level of delusional I can't imagine.
0/0	How patronising is this!!! He talks about the 'slight risk' of adverse reactions - over 1000 people in the UK alone have DIED from the vaccines so far. 4,200 in the USA. Thousands have had serious reactions. Any other vaccines would have been withdrawn if they had a tenth of that kind of death rate, but not this one. To suggest that 'adverse reactions' might include 'my cat was sick' is just plain insulting. I know of three people who have had serious adverse reactions from the vaccines - one person now has permanent vertigo, one person had palpitations and had to have hospital treatment, and one person who had the Pfizer one lost all feeling in her arms and legs within 7 hours of having the injection, and is still paralysed from the neck down, two months later. She's just 20. Don't tell me that people's 'concerns' are not justified.
0/0	How quick did they make that vaccine??? Think about that.....
1/1	How sad. For now the jabbed ones will be the victims of the non jabbed. We, the jabbed, will suffer the consequences of the non jabbed ones‚Ä¶
0/0	How safe is corona 19 vaccine when it has not gone through in 8 months which normally at least 9 years and is normally permanent , this vaccine requires a further dose and is not permanent. Now apparently there is another varient of the virus is this vaccine going to be ideal for this one ? I know that vaccines were used to eradicate smallpox, diphtheria measles , I cannot see why the measles vaccine can be used solo and the other two also!!
0/0/0/0/0/0	How safe is it? not safe enough for me to take.
0/0	How scary is that. Multiple vaccines with no guarantee that you won't mutate into some kind of weird creature and you'll still have to be tracked. This is truly a declaration of war.
0/-1	How stupid are these qanon people? Just the dumbest dumbasses alive! People who died in the middle ages are like ‚Äúwtf?!? You‚Äôre turning down vaccines?!? I died from the plague at 10 you spoiled pricks.‚Äù

1/1	How to reduce your chance of dying from Covid by 99%? Get vaccinated and a booster.

1/1	How was Polio eradicated? Vaccines. Everyone got a Polio vaccine and now the world does not have polio. If everyone got the covid vaccine (like all the vaccines during grade school) we would be in a much better place.
0/0	How was it tested in a large scale against the new variants ;; you told us that they haven‚Äôt been around for long , I trust my immune system , Thanks üôè
0/0	How were millions persuaded to take a radical new cell-altering injection which is still at the trial stage??? The power of propaganda is immense. The fact #BillGates, Depopulation King, funds the jab should be enough to raise the alarm!
0/0/0/0/0/0	How will life saving blood transfusions affect those who receive blood from a vaccinated person? I'm not sold on M-RNA, we do not know long term effects on how it will affect our DNA. It's irresponsible not to question this. I'll take my chances on natural immunity.
1/1	How would the drug companies making the vaccines make money if more people are dead? The vaccines are safe.
0/0	How would you ever know if a Covid-19 vaccine works or not when there are no symptoms or harmful effects from contracting it?
0/0	How wow, I‚Äôm so scared. Let me just go get my 10th booster and I will become immortal.
1/1	How y‚Äôall scared of the vaccine but not scared of Covid Face with raised eyebrow,
0/0	However, the "vaccinated" most definitely can spread the virus. Almost like it doesn't work.
0	Hows the johnson-johnson vax workin? There is 0 proof that mRNA has ever been effective for anything ever. My friend had Moderns shot- 5 weeks later got covid. Its a matter of time before each vaccine gets pulled from the market (just like astrazeca and johnson-johnson) which were considered SAFE A MONTH AGO.

1/-1	Huh, I wondered what happened to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Right, well I'm fully vaccinated so I can't take any chances, I better sit back and crack open a beer - too risky not to.
0	Huh... Get vaccinated ... Get boosted interesting theory. Except you're seeing more people who are getting vaccinated and getting the booster get sick more than those who have not. I haven't gotten any of these shots, I haven't been sick once with covid in the 3 years now with it
1/1	Huh...we actually use a'lot of medications from Pfizer at our closed door, private pharmacy. Politics aside, I hope this is the first step to normalcy. I just want to go back to Disneyland and want Comic-Con and Wrestlemania back.
1/1	Humanity has always benefited from new technology, mRNA vaccines is new technology. New things always scare some people but the pros far outweigh the cons

1/1	Hundreds of millions of people in the United States have received COVID-19 vaccines under the most intensive safety monitoring program in U.S. history.
1/1	Hundreds of thousands are dead. Just because the majority aren‚Äôt dead doesn‚Äôt stop it from being a big deal. A majority of Americans weren‚Äôt killed on 9/11, for example.

1/1	I (38) just got vaccinated (1 shot) in Jerusalem.
0/0	I (personally) know 2 people who died from the jabs, and about 5 who've told me about issues that they are now having after the jab. Most.won't tell me after I told them not to. I only know of one person who caught the Coof-vid who died but he was NOT healthy and 70 years old. My delinquent father still blame Trump for his friend's death. Anecdotally, I know quite a few people (coworkers, friends, family, church friends) who've had relatives get sick/die after the jab.
0/0	I 100% agree with your logic. I am getting tired of this new "Im vaccinated" trend happening everywhere. While everyone is touting vaccination as some passport to normal life, theres alot of us that don't need a pill or shot because our body's are the best defense against illness. The problem is we are still a society that wants a quick fix or to spend money for results instead of putting in the hard work of being truly healthy.
0/0	I AINT TAKING THAT BULLSHIT!!!!

1	I AM VACCINATED!
1/1	I AM a person living w/ cancer. I WILL advocate for those living w/ cancer to live better & longer. RIGHT NOW, that means fighting for pp w/ cancer to get #COVIDvaccine. None of the cancer science progress will have mattered if COVID kills us. We're high risk even if <65!

THERE IS A 99.6 SURVIVAL RATE FROM COVID, AND MANY BAD SIDEFFECTS, IT PERHAPS LIFE LONG, AND DEATHS FROM THIS SO-CALLED DRUG! IT CAN CAUSE YOUR NUREO TUBE TO SWELL, THINK ABOUT THAT.
1/1	I REALLY HATE THAT I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE SUMMER TO GET IT!!!!!
0/-1	I REALLY appreciate that Dr. Yasmin made the distinction between Anti-Vaxers and Vaccine-Hesitant. Ostracizing and mocking people hesitant to take a vaccine that was developed in an insanely short period of time is counterproductive. I think it is reasonable for people to want more evidence than they might usually require for such a vaccine.
0/0	I Rather die than taking the vaccine
1/1	I SINCERELY HOPE #VACCINATION RECORD CARDS ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECOGNIZED AS LEGITIMATE CITIZENS. If you're still fighting against vaccines after 2020, do the world a favor and just die. We don't have time for your bullshit anymore. Just...just fuck off. Thx

1/1	I Will happily get my third dose and every booster needed
1/1/1/1	I absolutely love this race in the scie clinic world. But I an hopeful this movement opens more pathways to other viral treatments. Like hiv or flu
0/0	I accepted the first dose of the AZ vaccine- unwillingly- because I wanted to travel freely and I thought I could counteract the side effects with supplements. Unfortunately it gave me a retinal hemorrhage after making me extremely sick for 10 days. I requested aid from the GP about the numbness in my legs but was told it was ‚Äònormal‚Äô. I suspect it was clots but have never had it checked because you are basically unable to get a face to face appointment anymore with a doctor. I certainly won‚Äôt be getting a second dose or any of the boosters. I‚Äôm not willing to be an experiment.
1/1	I acquired Covid in October 2020 while dutifully trying to avoid Hinshaw‚Äôs droplets. I survived but with days of fatigue. I got two doses of Astra ASAP and my symptoms eased. When Alberta offered MRNA on top so I could travel to the Flag of United StatesI got two Moderna. I‚Äôm proud quad vaxxed.
1/1	I actually find it interested that over 50,000 in the army had covid but only 21 of them died
1/1	I actually think the Covid vaccine should be mandatory. When I was a kid all students were given tuberculous vaccines in school. Why? Because it was a contagious deadly disease and a risk to public health. No debate. You took the shot. This should be no different.
1/1	I actually tried to sign up this morning, but for some reason my state doesn't add more slots till noon. I guess I will sign up then.
1/1	I actually wouldn‚Äôt mind doing this, I‚Äôm already going to be exposed to the virus in school so why not get infected willfully in a controlled environment?
1/1	I admit that it's hard for me to feel empathy with Covid deniers who are in intensive care now...
1/1	I advocate for vaccination while acknowledging the properties of natural immunity
1/1	I agree - every person who gets the vaccination is another break in the chain of contagion.
0/0	I agree 100% This vaccine was produced to fast. I'm not taking it.

1/1	I agree that everyone needs to do their patriotic duty as was embraced when polio hit! Get vaccinated stop listening to misinformation !
0/1	I agree that the data for the long term effects isn‚Äôt sufficient. I got vaccinated since I‚Äôm much older but I still wonder what the long term effects will be and how it will affect me in the future.
0/0	I agree their no need for vaccine
0/0	I agree with Joe. Got vaccinated from peer pressure. Ruined my life. Have had a ringing in my ears that will not go away that started 10 days after shot. If you‚Äôre healthy like I was I would say skip it. I‚Äôm miserable now. Would have never gotten the shot of it wasn‚Äôt for family and media pressure.

1/1	I agree with this point of view, we should believe in vaccines, the virus will get better
0/0	I agree with you I'm against this vaccine!
1/0	I agree with you. The UK Govt initially distanced themselves from the Russian vaccine, it now seems its efficacy is somewhat higher than the AZ vaccine. Mabey we should have placed orders with the Sputnik vaccine.
1/1	I agree you should get vaxxed
0/0	I agree,I'd rather rely on my own immunity and my lord who watches over me then be a lab rat,for a experimental jab
1/1	I agree. Let's get them done. We have the vaccines available to get all nurses and all teachers done.
0/0	I agree. Usually clinical trials take at least 9 years to gather robust safety data (observation for side effects) in a variety of various patient groups (elderly, children, pregnant women, patients with specific health conditions, etc.), but this vaccine as been rushed through by the health authorities and granted marketing authorisation (permission to be administered to patients) at such a breakneck speed, it is of a grave concern. That is why we do not need a similar situation as was seen in thalidomide.

0/0	I almost burst out laughing when they used Dolly Parton to promote their evil vaccine . " Look here, if she takes it then it must be the right thing to do" .
1/1	I almost died of flu 7 years ago. Believe me I'll take whatever side effects may possibly happen vs going through what I went through.
1	I almost forgot about how much I loved meeting random weird groups of people while going out w/ my friends, always ending up at some random taco shop (or Denny‚Äôs) at the end. Swapping Snapchat‚Äôs and never seeing them again. I feel like I took it all for granted but those times are coming back soon enough!!

0/0	I already have a perfect designed immune system so I pass. I've never heard of a single person since the virus was discovered talked about good nutrition to prevent a disease. Vaccines has done more harm than good that's the truth.
0/0	I already know that I will never get one because I would like to die a natural death....
1/0	I already mentioned they had to genetically engineer the vaccine to save time. The old way of making a vaccine takes too long, and liberals along with their friends in the mainstream media wanted a vaccine ASAP and were pushing for it, but believed the Trump administration could not make it as fast as claimed, and President Trump is the type of guy that loves to prove people wrong. In fact the vaccine would not have been able to be made so fast if the Trump administration did not remove the regulations that would have slowed down the process. Trump was originally pushing for Therapeutic drugs. Remember whatever Trump is for liberals go against, and change the narrative. They made people think there were no alternatives to treating the virus, and vaccine was the only hope meaning the drugs the Trump administration approved were working. Problem is they made it difficult for doctors to prescribe them, and recommended for emergency use only for the general public.
1/0	I already told my doctor the second they have one for me I want one lol
1/1	I also believe vaccines help to prevent deaths.
1/1	I also can‚Äôt wait to get the vaccine I currently have COVID and it sucks and I missed Christmas one thing about working in retail you can possibly get COVID
0/0	I also dislike to add foreign RNA to my body. Why is that weird to media.
1/1	I also got mine in January!! Best thing I ever did!

1/1	I also got the vaccine, Moderna, and 5 days after I felt some inflammation in my axillary lymph nodes.
1/1	I also had the first Pfizer vaccine and the only symptom was a bruised feeling arm, especially the next day. I found it uncomfortable to sleep on and that disturbed my sleep, making me tired. 4 days later, no arm pain at all :)
1/1	I also have an immune system, mine is better prepared to tackle COVID-19 because I‚Äôve been #vaccinated
1/1	I also have an immune system, mine is better prepared to tackle COVID-19 because I‚Äôve been #vaccinated Because I know that #VaccinesWork
1/1/1	I also heard a lot of "I'll let other people take it first to see how it goes" turn into I want to get it asap. So far so good
1/1	I also hesitated to get vaccinated in early 2021 while pregnant, it‚Äôs hard to take such a big risk when you invest so much time and love in your baby:) glad to hear that these pregnancies may be safe despite becoming vaccinated prepartum
1/1	I also plan on getting the vaccine as soon as I am eligible to do so. Stay Safe
0/0	I also regret getting it, constant headaches each day since the first shot (8 days) and from day 7 I have ringing in the ears, like a high pitched sound. It's bad. I started reading about this and looks like there are a lot of cases similar to mine. I won't be getting the second shot
0/0	I always ALWAYS ask if my waiter or waitress is vaccinated. THAT will decide if they get a tip or not. If they ARE VACCINATED... NO TIP. If they are NOT VACCINATED... I give them at least 5% tip!
0/0/0/0	I always believe the opposite of what governments push. They say there's a pandemic so I know there is no pandemic. They want everybody to take vaccines so I will never take vaccine.
1/1	I always feel sorry for the loss of any life. I feel even more sorry for the medical staff who have to fight to keep people alive, at risk to their own lives and mental health. It‚Äôs just frustrating when much of this is preventable and I resent those who deliberately spread disinformation.
1/1	I always practice safe sex, but I skip protection when dating an anti-vaxx woman, because it‚Äôs better to pay child support for 8 years than 18.
0/0	I always reacted to the flu vaccines, I am not getting the vaccine. I would rather get Covid
1/1	I always vacccinate
1	I am 100% pro vaccination (I've had 3 jabs already) but truth be told I've had a nasty side effect from my 2nd moderna jab, my oral cavity got seriously inflamed with shingles, almost lost a tooth. All is good now with no lingering issues.
1/1	I am 100% pro vaccine though! ~ I would rather deal with a day or two of minor side effects then have to go through covid and possibly have long term issues from it! (also I had no side effects after the first dose, so I was very lucky, this time not so much)
1	I am 100% pro vax. But tbf the percentage of the population, especially boomers, that is on multiple daily drugs is insane and makes me question the medical industry.
0/1	I am 100% pro-vac for everything but the COVID shots. My sister got the moderna when she was 8 months pregnant. The baby was completely healthy before hand, then a week later after having nasty symptoms after getting the shot, the baby had heart failure inside her. It was completely rare, and no one blamed the shot. And when i got the second one I also had nasty side effects for 2 weeks. Don‚Äôt trust them enough for it to be good for us.

0/0/0	I am 24, and I am not getting the vaccine, I have already had covid too. It‚Äôs my call, but I just don‚Äôt feel comfortable, especially at my age
1/1	I am 54 and I'm getting my second shot tomorrow ,i went with my mother age 80 3 weeks ago,she was one of the first to be vaccinated.
1/1	I am 60 years old when I will get vaccine?
0/-1	I am 67 years old and had covid in March 2020. In March of 2021 had my first vaccines. April 2021 had my second vaccine. A few days after became ill. When I say ill I really mean it. 9 months later I am still sick as hell. In and out of hospitals, doctors, countless tests, blood tests and more. Haven't driven in over 5 months. And everyone agrees, main stream media doesn't say anything about this. And as far as people dying from heart attacks and strokes, that is ashamed, but we are talking covid and this stuff is real and it is happening to real people. Everyone should wake up and be careful.
0/0	I am 71. My son-inlaw is a dr. He won 't get or give the shot. Nor will I takr it. Likewise if I get covid I will take the Ivermectin. I take vit D and have been for many years. Never had a flu vac and haven't gotten the flu. When my husband was working he was required to geg the flu vaccine and always got the flu. Go figure!
1/1	I am 73 and had gotten my first shot of AstraZeneca a week ago. After the process ... I did not feel anything as stated nor did it create any annoyances like mild pain or whatever. I can not remember anything that has bothered me.
0/0	I am 73 woman and before the series of Pfizer vaccinations, including the booster, I was very physically active. I walked 4-5 miles a day, lifted weights and pilates. After the first shot I started experiencing hip pain and was limited in walking to less than a mile. My hip pain has progressively gotten worse. It feels like I have a hot coal in my hip joint. Now this morning I barely moved my hand and my wrist experienced an aching pain. I can't lift anything with that hand now. The wrist was fine yesterday. I really wish I hadn't taken the vaccinations and just worked on my immunities level naturally. I'm pretty frustrated and truly wish I haven't taken the vaccine. Hopefully this is not something we will deal with the rest of our lives.
1/1	I am 74 and can't wait for mine. It's peace of mind which is very important.
1/1	I am 74 yrs old, received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine last month. I had NO reaction to vaccine whatsoever. If anything, I now have peace of mind !
1/1	I am 75 years old and had 5 excuses for not getting the vaccine. Some were previous health conditions. But yesterday I said what the hell and got the vaccine. I saw all the videos on the pros and cons of all the videos no matter the source. I had zero side effects and zero pain and hardly noticed that anything even happened. No pain, no side effects. Here in Canada, they are slow in getting the second dose. Here the wait for Pfizer is 4 months and not 21 days. Many young people who are still being forced to go to classes are complaining that they cannot get the vaccine and that nobody wears masks in school. Maybe this varies by the school.
1/1	I am 77 and husband 79 we got our 2nd moderna shot on 2/22. All we had was a sore arm and a little tierd for about 24hrs. After that feeling great! I am so thankful for these vaccines.
1/1	I am 78 so if offered the vacine i will have it. I can only blame myself if any thing goes wrong but will to take the gamble
0/0	I am 79year old and afraid of taking booster
1/1	I am 82 and had all the Vaccines from 1940 and still here, living a healthy life!
1/1	I am BOOSTED. It saved my life
0/0	I am NEVER getting any vaccine ever
0/0	I am NEVER getting that shot! I will put my trust in my almighty God!
0/0	I am NOT a lab rat. Especially for a vaccine for the Chinese Knockoff of the Flu.
1/1	I am NOT an Anti-vaxxer.
1/0	I am NOT an anti-vaxxer, but I AM against vaccine mandates. Especially since yesterday! Yesterday, I met a man who ended up in hospital for two weeks with kidney failure caused by a Covid vaccine. His kidney function went down to 15%! He ended up on a mild dose of chemotherapy, too! His kidney function has risen back up, but it is still 50% down on their normal function. So, my question is this: If vaccines are mandates, who takes responsibility when everything goes wrong?
0/0	I am NOT getting vaccinated against this virus. I‚Äôll build my own immunity thanks.
0/0	I am NOT taking any vaccines related to Covid-19. As a matter of fact, I am not taking any more vaccines for as long as i am alive

0/0	I am NOT taking it NO MATTER WHAT!!!!
0/0	I am NOT taking that vaccine. I absolutely do NOT trust it for a number of reasons.
1/0	I am OK with the vaccine, forcing or coercing people to take it against their will is just wrong. If someone tried to do that to me, something really upsetting might happen to them.
1/1	I am VERY grateful for the vaccines, but will forever be cautious, at least until the youngest of children are protected.
0/0	I am a 68 year old man who I think has fought off both main COVID variants without the vaccine or medical care. It seems to me that I am better off having a successful natural response to the disease than artificial one.

1/1	I am a GP. I have had 3 Doses of the #CovidVaccine. I have also had every other vaccine I have been advised to have by Healthcare Professionals from birth onwards to help protect me and those around me from serious illness and disease.
1/1	I am a Jewish. I wish to be vaccinated immediately.
1/1	I am a Registered Nurse. I feel privileged to have received 3 doses of the covid vaccine. My colleagues & I are committed to caring for ALL patients w/compassion & dignity, irrespective of vaccination status. We will not be intimidated.

1/1	I am a child born early 60‚Äôs and so lucky that by then Dr Salk had come up with Polio Vaccine and was vaccinated as my 12 siblings & now we are again vaccinated against Covid-19 and we all believe in vaccination
1/1	I am a doctor and let me say a thing, THE VACCINES ARE SECURE!
1/1	I am a doctor who cares for complex patients. YES, you should get the vaccine. It is the right thing to do.
1/1	I am a fit 60+ year old with no underlying health conditions and will certainly have the vaccine. The risk of very serious illness and death from Covid rises as we get older and in my age range it is 30 times higher than for 18 to 29 year olds. I don't want to hide away because others decide this thoroughly tested vaccine is unsafe, I also still work and would like some normal life back.
0/0	I am a health care worker and I don't want to take the vaccine right away.
1/1	I am a healthcare worker but my work is administrative, so I work from home. I'm also young and healthy. I won't be eligible for the vaccine until the last phases. I want it mostly to do my part; I am cognizant that I personally am unlikely to be adversely affected were I to catch COVID due to my health and demographics, but my life isn't the only one that matters. I stay home and wear a mask when grocery shopping because I have the basic human decency to care about possibly inadvertently causing someone else harm or death. Anyone without medical reason to avoid vaccines that choose not to get this one is frankly selfish.
0/0	I am a healthy 25 year old. Got covid at 12 weeks pregnant, and I only suffered a loss of taste and smell. No need for vaccination thanks. Not enough long term studies.
0/-1	I am a little bit hesitant
1/1	I am a meteorologist from Israel. Ph.d. And i think you are doing unsmarts thing to decide not to receive the vaccine. As a nurse you give a very bad example to people . Any How, you look cute. Shalom. Greetings from Israel.
0/0	I am a nurse and I will not have it, who knows what the future complications are and besides more people are dying since the vaccine has been rolled out!
1/1	I am a nurse and i got the vaccine 5 days ago. I have not noticed any side effects at all, except a sore arm. But it was not that sore, and was only sore for about 1 1/2 days. And, in the past, I have had flu shots that made my arm more sore. I am fit and healthy, and have a pretty strong immune system. I got the vaccine because I am more concerned passing COVID to others and about getting COVID and having long term issues. Many who have gotten only minor illness from COVID have had long term issues with micro clots in thier organs. I just think that is a way worse scenario then any possible side effects from vaccine
0	I am a nurse in Canada and I stand alongside these nurses. Theres a reason why we are hesitant. My reason, we are seeing larger groups of people with vaccine side effects that the mainstream media doesnt talk about. The silence on this is disturbing especially because itz getting worse.
0/0	I am a nurse, and at least 2 days a week I am caring for Covid patients. Most days, 4 out of 5 of my Covid patients are fully vaccinated. Do not believe the BS that the unvaccinated have more serious cases than the vaccinated. Lies and more lies.
1/1	I am a part of the Pfizer vaccine trial. I could have gotten it, or I could have gotten placebo. My doses were done in September and October. There was definitely an afternoon after my second dose where I felt like crap. Very tired, stomach felt gross, wanted to just lay on the couch, and I couldn‚Äôt get my body the right temperature. Sweatshirt made me sweat, but t shirt felt freezing. That lasted until I went to bed that night, then I woke up feeling fine.

1/1	I am a patient facing hospital employee. I have finished my second dose yesterday. Frontline workers are so stressed about getting covid and bringing into their families that they would rather take the vaccine as is. I cannot tell you how stressful it is for the nurses to have more and more positive covid patients showing up on the units. It is physically exhausting to put on your PPE and it is mentally trying when patients are holding your hand asking you not to leave the room. There is a societal obligation and taking the vaccine.
1/1	I am a physician and very PRO vaccine. But there is no reason the government should be forcing anyone to get one against their will.
0/0	I am a proud anti-vaxxer
1/1	I am a psychology major who has seen the vaccine studies. They are proven safe and useful. There is no evidence for holding a counter position. Every educated adult in a science and medical field are in consensus about it.
1/0/0/0	I am a registered nurse. I am being pressured to take the vaccine. I quit and I won‚Äôt vaccinate. I have enuf problems.
0/0	I am a stroke survivor and I‚Äôm terrified for the vaccine, just hearing how many people developed blood cloth After taking the vaccine I don‚Äôt want to take that risk after what I‚Äôve been through with this stroke that was caused by a blood Cloth, so sorry for this lady lost her life leaving behind her daughter

1/1	I am absolutely behind the vaccine programme, the team at Oxford are heroes.
0/0	I am afraid of Covid Vaccine. Is there any side effect..no injection yet on my arm.
0/0	I am afraid of the side effects because the testing should take 2 years
0/0	I am against the vaccine, there has not been enough time testing on it, they just want us to be a bunch of guinea pigs
0/0	I am against vaccines simply because of the additives that they put in these vaccines which are known to damage the body, for instance aluminum.
0/0	I am against vaccines since my senior year in hi school , when I had to get ALL my vaccinations or no diploma would be given , I emigrated to this great country , LEGALLY , you cannot come here LEGALLY without proper vaccinations , it never cane up in 13 years till 2 months b 4 graduation , seems odd to me , # NEVER AGAIN , MY BODY , MY CHOICE , btw , I don't wear the ribbon or the masks !!!
0	I am against vaccines that hasn't gone through years of proper testing, especially for flu's with a 99.7% survival rating
1/0	I am all for vaccination & have been vaccinated with Pyzer since December of 2020 but many are having more than mild side affects. One person that works with us is having increasing neurological side effects at this time & getting worst. Her MD‚Äôs unable to cope with it? There should be panels of experts looking into these cases to suppress the negativity that results from people witnessing these individuals suffering. Who will care for these individuals in the long run? Issues constant headaches & migraines, stuttering & now uncontrollable eye movement, fluttering constantly. Very sad to witness to a person that was very energetic & had no issues like she is presently afflicted with.
0/-1	I am allergic to everything. So that knocks me out‚Ä¶
1/1	I am also a health worker, I took my 1st dose of Oxford Vaccine
1/1	I am also fully vaxxed and believe vaccines are safe for the vast majority of people.
0/0	I am also skeptical about the vaccine
1/1	I am also vaccinated with two doses of Pfizer's vaccine. It feels safe to know that you have effective protection.
1/1	I am amongst the more vulnerable people. Insulin dep. Diabetic. Asthma, mild angina, and fibromyalgia. Locked in since March afraid to go outside. I can't wait to get the vaccine so that I can rejoin the human race again. I hope I don't have to wait to long.
1/1	I am an EMT in the CA bay area and I have both shots of the moderna vaccine. I only had soreness in my arm for both shots with no side effects.
0/0	I am an RN and still have antibodies. I totally agree with you. As long as I have antibodies, I will not get the vaccine. I donate blood products on a regular basis and my blood is tested for antibodies at every donation. Going on 8 mths now!
0/-1	I am an athlete. I got my second dose of the covid vaccine 3 days ago. The next day after the vaccine, I couldn't sleep. I had the worst fever ever. Today is my 3rd day after the second shot, I feel normal but my stamina when I workout is not the same. I feel like I get fatigued much faster than before and I run out of breath much faster than I used to. I swear I am not lying.

0/0	I am anti-vax due to religious opinion,
0/0	I am ashamed to admit it, but until covid I believed that every vaccine was safe and effective, and that anti-vaxxers were dangerous lunatics. Now I know that no vaccine is as safe or as effective as we are told, and that anti-vaxxers are principled freedom-fighters.
1/-1	I am asthma patient, can i get vaccination
0/0	I am at high risk, but I won‚Äôt be standing in line waiting to be vaccinated. Far from it‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll turn and run for the hills and hide if I have to!
0/-1	I am at least waiting for a full year. I wanna see what it does to people. I refuse to be a vaccine test dummy.

1/1	I am convinced, I will get it.
0/0	I am currently watching various videos to get some more information on the COVID 19 vaccine and I've decided that I'm not getting it. For now I'm doing very well with masks and social distancing, so I'm pretty confident!
1/1	I am currently working frontline nursing in the UK.After consulting with many other health pro's,I decided to have the vac.I've already had Covid,back in April 2020.Had the vac last Friday,no issues.
0/0	I am deeply concerned about pushing this vaccine through so fast. I, quite frankly, do not want to take this vaccine until it has been in use for quite some time in order to evaluate the side effect profile and how effective it actually is.
0/0	I am deeply offending by the fake science the WHO, CDC, MSM, Big Tech and the government have been throwing in everyones face! These genetic vaccines are very dangerous and were never designed to stop Sars-Cov-2.
0/0/0	I am definitely NOT getting the vaccine. But what do you guys think is in the vaccine and why tf are they forcing it on us???
1/1/1/1	I am definitely getting the vaccine because I want to go back to work!
0/0	I am definitely hesitant given that the medium/ long term safety data simply does not exist for mRNA vaccinations. The theory behind it and the initial trial results seem beautiful, but I don't feel like myself or my patients being a guinea big for the longer term.
0/0	I am double jabbed and looking back I truly regret getting it done, it's affected mine and many other women's cycle.
1/1	I am doubled masked, double vaxxed, boosted, and socially distant. We need to trust the science which means listening to experts like Dr Fauci. We need to enforce the vaccine mandate for everyone (including children), create a booster mandate, and enforce an N95 mask mandate. It's not that hard and anyone who does not comply should be sent to jail or an isolation camp.
1/1	I am experiencing side effects from the vaccine. Over the last year I have talked to 10 families who lost a loved one. And know others with serious lifetime issues from their experience having Covid. Despite these side effects, I would get the vaccine again. Covid is a bigger risk.
1/1	I am extremely thrilled with what the scientists have achieved. Great job! The world counts on you.
1/1	I am for the vaccine and think it's safe
1/1	I am fully vaccinated and boosted, I do everything I can to make sure to protect my hospital and my fellow Canadians. I'm doing this because I love this country!!

1/1	I am fully vaccinated now and I have no problems with getting a booster shot each year like the flu vaccine. I want too be safe and not sick. I pray this all comes too an end in a major good way
1/1	I am fully vaccinated with Pfizer and I confidently say I would've been in the hospital day 2....I had headaches for 14 days and now after testing negative I still get them here and there. I couldn't eat, drink water, or even sleep. Please get vaccinated I can't push enough because this virus is painful and relentless.
1/1	I am fully vaccinated with a booster. But until more people get their first shot, I fear the additional variants to come. I am elderly but have a new grandson I would like to be around to get to know. I am so frustrated by the misinformation people are being fed. It‚Äôs all emotionally exhausting!
1/1	I am fully vaccinated. I also wear a seatbelt and don‚Äôt drive the wrong way on the highway. I don‚Äôt drink bleach or play Russian roulette. I do these things not because ‚Äúthe government is controlling me‚Äù but because I want to live and spend time with my family and friends.
1/1	I am generally in favour of vaccinations. I believe the approved COVID vaccines are safe and effective. Of course, the effectiveness here refers only to certain areas and is therefore limited in other areas. I am vaccinated and boostered myself.
1/1	I am generally very pro-vaccine, .especially the J&J vaccine, and the AstraZeneca/Oxford one.
1/1	I am getting May second dose tommorow.

0/0	I am going to pass on the vaccine; my body, my choice.
1/1	I am going to take it, just to be safe. My parents would make me anyway, I guess it is true though that people can choose if they have the vaccine but they have to accept that they might not be able to go to some stores and places that require you have the vaccine.

One poor person passed out on line. Overall I felt better after getting it my anxiety went away 15 mins after the shot.
1/1/1	I am having my first AZ vaccine in Sydney today. I‚Äôm in an older age group and the risk/benefit considerations side with going ahead and having it. It‚Äôs important to know about the potential risks - just as important to keep perspective. Thank you John for balanced information üåªüá¶üá∫

0/0	I am having the EXACT same problem!! Last month I started breaking out in hives a week after receiving the booster. I tried everything to manage it and nothing worked. After seeing 2 doctors and going through a round of prednisone, I was still having issues and was told to see an allergist.
0/0	I am healthy and won‚Äôt be getting the vaccine. If I was you, I would stand strong with your personal integrity on this one.
0/0/0/0/0	I am healthy in my 60's. Never had any shots/ vaccines since grade school. Not taking it! Never!
1/1	I am hoping that I will be able to get one soon so I can continue my clinical volunteer hours and the hospital and get some shadowing hours as well!
1/1	I am hoping that I will be able to get one soon so I can continue my clinical volunteer hours and the hospital and get some shadowing hours as well! Thank you for putting out this video! I hope that your holidays were safe and happy!
1/1	I am hoping to god that all the logistics work out perfectly and we can stay on track for 20 million people vaccinated in the US by the end of 2020.
0/1	I am hoping to, but not be able to get the vaccine.You see, I have an extreme allergy to chicken eggs, and many vaccines contain pieces of a virus that has been incubated in chicken eggs. Thus, they contain the proteins that I am allergic to.
0/0	I am immunocompromised due to being a transplant recipient. I am hesitant about recieving the vaccine.
1	I am in 1B for vaccination and have no idea what is happening! Complete shambles!
0/0	I am in India and let me tell the whole world - Mass vaccinations are going on here even when hundreds are dying or getting paralyzed within days of vaccination. The media is not covering any of it!
0/0	I am in a high count area. My friend got covid and told me more than half of the people in the ER sick with him said they had gotten the vaccine! Some just don‚Äôt know but some do and promote a lie!!
1/1	I am in high risk category and will get it as soon as I am able to. My mother passed away October 8th with covid.
1/-1	I am in his age range but I took it seriously because I had pre-existing conditions and Im immunodeficient. I did everything I could to prevent myself from getting Covid however I live with people that did not take the disease seriously so I got Covid recently. Because I got the vaccine Covid was not bad at all for me and I realize how lucky I am. I was literally able to just stay at home and rest and I got over it just fine. I am so happy that I didn‚Äôt wait or listen to propaganda or whatever people are listening to. I know for a fact had I not had the vaccine I would have died.
1/1	I am in my seventies and I couldn't care less about side-effects. In any case, it seems that the politicians and the press do not understand how vaccines work. The oral polio vaccine might cause 3 cases per million doses while there are 5,000 per million if not.,
0/0	I am in no hurry. FINISH YOUR TRIALS FIRST
1/1	I am in no way an anti-vaxxer. Hell, I work in the pharmacuetical industry. I have the upmost confidence in the regulatory agencies worldwide and the rigor at which there studies, by experienced players, are going through.

1/1	I am in the vaccine study and wish I could get a Pfizer t shirt. Thank you and I am proud to be part of this groundbreaking technology. Thank you agian
1/1	I am just mad that there will be no long term consequences for being an anti-vaxxer during the pandemic. Siaka will be able to pedal his idiocy unmarred by the experience.
1/1	I am just slowly getting better i had Covid & was in the hospital for a week, it wasn‚Äôt fun and I still have side effects now from it. I‚Äôm looking forward to this one dose vaccine. This virus is scary and i wish more understood. I have not seen my family since the 17th of this month.
0/0	I am kind of scared of the vaccine
0/-1	I am legit more terrified of the vaccine at this point. Especially since it's development just HAD to include some sort of "liability clause" in it so you can't sue anyone involved in its creation, even if there becomes a proven, direct, and irrefutable link between illness/death and the vaccine. You need to sue the government itself.
1/1	I am looking forward to getting mine. Apparently in April
1/1/1/1	I am lucky enough to where I work in a field where I can receive the vaccine and I have had both shots and no side affects what so ever.
1/1	I am lucky to have an appointment next week.
0/0	I am more "scared" of the vaccine than I am of dying from Covid, yeah. Well said.
1/1	I am more concern about covid side effects. I take the vaccine gladly.
1/-1	I am more scared of the long term side effects of covid then the vaccine
0/0	I am more than convinced to not have this vaccine!
0/0	I am never getting A vaccine ever
0/0/0/0/0/0	I am never getting vaccinated with this vaccine.
0/0	I am never risking my DNA over some flu #COVIDhoax
0/0	I am no Antivaxxer conspiracy theorist, but do I really want to trust a vaccine that was developed in 9 months? I know it had to be made quickly but it seems risky rushing out a vaccine like that.
1/1	I am no expert just a messenger, trust the vaccine
0/0	I am no longer 'trying to dig up evidence to prove' vaccines cause autism. There is already abundant evidence....This debate is not scientific but is political
0/0	I am no vaccine skeptic but the speed at which thus vaccine is developed is very very concerning.Condensung years into months will inevitably result in compromises and we dont know the longterm health consequences...
1/1	I am not a fool and so I had my vaccination at the very first opportunity and had no problems or side effects. I can now face going out without any fear.
0/0	I am not about to become any part of a genome experiment
1/1	I am not afraid of the vaccine but I hope the next day's sick leave is given after the injection.
1/1	I am not against the vaccine and I think everyone should get it although I did have some side effects
1/1	I am not an anti-vaxxer I believe that the vaccines work, but to push out the covid vaccine so early without really long-term testing makes me a bit nervous, i don't really know how it works, so i may get things wrong, but I think if they had a longer period to test it would make the public less angry, also take a weight of most people's chest
0/0	I am not an anti-vaxxer.... I am a multi-dose anti-vaxxer. All you have to do is follow the money. It all started in the 80's. This is not difficult to figure out yet I have never seen it discussed since.
0/0	I am not anti vax but I am anti over vaccination
1	I am not anti-vaccine.
1/1	I am not anti-vax thanks
0/0	I am not antivax, but these vaccines have not been tested long enough to prove Safety.
1/1	I am not avoiding any COVID vaccinations. I have had both my shots and will have every follow up shot advised by doctors. I believe it is the duty of every person in society to have these vaccinations. Otherwise we will never get rid of this dangerous disease.
0/0	I am not avoiding to not getting the covid vaccine. i just don't believe in getting the covid vaccine. so, i won't get it.
1/0	I am not bothered on the opinion of de Pfeffel, with his degree in Greats, on the efficacy of vaccines. Please keep politicians and similar ignorants out of the loop. I want to hear from qualified experts.
0/0	I am not getting a vaccine for a virus that I have a 98% chance of surviving. That is just plain stupid
0/0	I am not getting it. Healthy people don't need this vaccine. Apparently, people re-infected, and all the current rules will stay for us. Even the test is false according to the SDS and WHO.
0/0	I am not getting the shot
0/0	I am not getting the vaccine. Covid19 has 98.9% survival rate. Do you know what the long term effects are from taking the vaccine? No, you don't.
0/0	I am not getting the vaccine.......Jesus has my back.
0/0	I am not getting those vaccines in my arm,I am pretty sure generic is what is being given to third world countries.
0/0	I am not getting vaccinated because I do not trust our new communist government. I feel there are very bad things going on behind the scenes. If you agree, follow me.
0/0	I am not going to be a pet for the finance monsters like pfizer.
0/0	I am not going to take it unless I have no other choice
0/0/0	I am not going to take it!!
0/0	I am not going to take the vaccin..üëä
0/0	I am not gonna take a dose of that suspicious poison
1/0	I am not interested in a blood clot going to my brain or heart or lung... instant death. Why do ppl take this dose? It is unnecessary
0/0	I am not planning on taking the vaccine. I don‚Äôt trust the ingredients. Concerned about mandate ID
0/0	I am not planning on taking the vaccine. I've been surprised in finding out most of my friends and family members are lining up to get it, no questions asked. It's scary.
0/0	I am not ready to be vaccinated. I will run with natural immunity
0/-1	I am not sure what vaccine does
0/0	I am not taking an mRNA injection that will permanently alter my DNA I studied Biology at a D1 school btw
0/0	I am not taking any of these shots they can shove it up their a'ss
0/0	I am not taking any vaccine.
0/0/0/0	I am not taking it
0	I am not taking it!
0/0	I am not taking it, you can give mine to Biden and Harris. I‚Äôll share not greedy. It‚Äôs against my religious beliefs
0/0	I am not taking it. They can't even develop a vaccine for the flu or cold - both coronaviruses. They're both still with us , and we haven't locked down the planet over those. At the very least , I want to see what occurs to all the sheep who rushed to have an unproven vaccine pumped into their system , and see what develops.
0/-1	I am not taking the vaccine if takes my job too
0/0	I am not taking the vaccines
0/0	I am not vaccine-hesitant. I am vaccine-avoidant.
0/0	I am not worried about wearing masks because I used to use them. Personally quarantine and lockdown don't bother me a lot but I think these have been affected small business, so I hope they will be stopped and go back to normal asap. The biggest concern is vaccines and health passport. I am afraid of getting them.
1/1	I am not worried for myself, but my brother suffers from an autoimmune disease and can get very sick from covid. I will take the vaccine for his sake.
1/1	I am now fully vaccinated and very pleased. I will still mask but I feel much safer.
1/1	I am obese, I will take the vaccine doctor! I will protect myself
1/1	I am older and I will take my chances with the vaccine rather than the covid
1/1	I am on the downside run of having Corona (1 quarantine week left) and I wish I had this before I got it. I‚Äôm glad someone is making headway. This virus sucks. So much worse than anything else I‚Äôve had.
0/1	I am on triple vax, 3 doses for the last 15 days. I am Covid + this morning. Can I say that the vaccine is ineffective in preventing transmission (the usual goal of a vaccine), without being called an antivax, toothless, conspiracy theorist?
1/1	I am one of >300 scientists who signed this calling for global vaccine equity. In addition to the certainty of new variants emerging, there's also the disgrace of people, including health care workers, dying of COVID-19 because of lack of vaccine access
1/1	I am one of the fortunate people who has been fully vaccinated. It's liberating being able to take a deep breath and know that you aren't going to spread covid or die from it. It's been on the back of my mind since this all started, but now it's not. Don't be afraid to get the vaccine. It's worth it.
1/1	I am one of those few who experienced AEFI due to Covid vaccine. I had to be treated every time I received the vaccine, for the side effects. During booster, I fainted within 5 mins after the shot but you won‚Äôt see me talk bad about the vaccine because the vaccine works for me.
1/1	I am one of those people, just got my shot this morning
0/0	I am one who will be afraid to take an early vaccine like this. Be careful out there
1/0	I am over 40 with kidney disease, and my husband is over 50 with diabetes. We both got covid back in August along with out kids who live with us. Only had a fever for a couple days and some body aches, but nothing bad. I am a nutritionist and we eat very healthy. We upped our intake of zinc, quercetin, vitamin C, vitamin D3, NAC, selenium, drank lots of water and rested. This doesn't have to be a death sentence even for vulnerable people like us.
1/1	I am over 60 and caught Covid a couple of weeks ago. Mild flu symptoms for three days (bad headache and very painful throat), then got better. Fully vaccinated and boosted. So thankful for the vaccine.
1/1	I am over 70 and I am eagerly awaiting the vaccine, any vaccine.
1/1	I am passionately pro vaccine. Reasonable people however have had enough of the poor decisions
0/0	I am perfectly healthy and don't intend to change that by risking a covid shot. We are NOT in this together. Never have been. Never will be. WHO doesn't want normal to return. They enjoy control.
1/1	I am planning on getting the vaccine myself.
1/1	I am praying you both take the vaccine! It's the best thing I have done so far!
1/1	I am pregnant, I need to take it ..
1/1	I am prepared, but it is not possible to know when one will be vaccinated even though I am 73 years old in a month!
1/1	I am pro vaccination
1/1/1	I am pro vaccination but these companies really do have Fallout series style names...
1/1	I am pro vaccine
1/1	I am pro vaccine and encourage everyone to get it but personal choice matters and we cannot remove hospital access for those who don‚Äôt have it.
1/-1	I am pro vaccine and following the vaccines but will not get it until masks not necessary afterward. If they don't believe enough in the vaccine, neither do i.
1/1	I am pro vaccine but am troubled by mandatory unproven vaccines which are experimental. It is contravening the Nuremberg code.
1/1	I am pro vaccine by the way. Vaccines can have side effects just like every other medical treatment. However low the chance of developing side effects is, It is still more likely than dying from Covid. I am under 20.
1/1	I am pro vaccine, the covid vaccine kinda makes me weary though, my grandpa got it and ended up in the hospital, I of course will still be getting it since my little brother isn‚Äôt able to. We are still waiting for my doctor to get the vaccine in, they said they would call us since they are still waiting. I would iv gotten it the same day I was getting all my other shots (2 for serious stuff and 1 flue) but they didn‚Äôt have it yet.
1/1	I am pro vaccine. However I am worried that to go see a movie or book a flight you will have to show your vaccine card.
0/1/0	I am pro vaccine. I vaccinate myself and my kids. However, this vaccine is just tied to way too much suspicion and there is a lot of stuff in the dark...that we won't be getting the vaccine.
1/1	I am pro vaccine. I‚Äôve had every vaccine I could get and once i have children, I will have them vaccinated appropriately. I am also pro masks. I think they work to reduce viral load. I just want to clear up confusion.
1/1	I am pro vax, I am vaccinated and I don‚Äôt think that unvaccinated people should die :(
1/1	I am pro vax, pro Biden, pro mask mandates. But I think its laughable to trust government as the sole source of this data.
1/1	I am pro-vaccination, but I disagree with mockery. If we do not rise above such attitudes how can we expect the anti-vaccination crowd to behave with more decency than they currently are when us the pro-vaccine crowd are behaving with the same lack of decency towards them? I hardly believe that mockery will help people change their minds and vaccinate. We are so polarized already and split into camps, why contribute more? We should draw attention to covid deaths of those anti-vaccination, we absolutely should, but mockery is not the right way to do so. I am actually disappointed that mockery is even taken into consideration. Can we really not have more balanced and healthier views on this?
1/1	I am pro-vaccine. People also need to understand that wanting to get the best vaccine is not that crazy a concept.
1/1	I am pro. I feel bad for some anti-vaxxers because they have been traumatized due to negative side effects from vaccines(as rare as they are).
1/1	I am proud that I live in Spain! Our vaccinations (as well as Portugal's) are the best in Europ√©!
1/1	I am proud the majority of Canadians, including truckers, already have had their vaccines!
1/1	I am proud to be a fully #vaccinated doggo. #VaccinesWork #VaccinesSaveLives
1/1	I am proud to say that I'm getting my second vaccine
1/1	I am proudly vaxxinated. No side effects. :-)
0/0	I am reading this morning that a doctor in Miami and a nurse in Portugal have died after getting the vaccine, and that half of the healthcare workers in California are refusing it. So no, I'm not taking it.
1/1	I am ready for #AstraZeneca . Or #BioNTech. Or #Moderna. I will take ANY approved vaccine. Why? Because our own exp√¢‚Ç¨
1/1	I am ready for the vaccine whenever my age group is allowed to get. So ready to help America get back to some kind of normal.
1/1	I am ready for the vaccine. The owner at my work just told us he will give us a paid week off once we all get vaccinated, I love that he is convincing people by way of incentive
1/1	I am ready for this to be over too, I'm ready for people to stop dying, I'm ready for my parents to be able to hug and kiss their grand children. I'm ready for the world to be safe again.
0/1	I am ready! I want a return to normal! I am healthy so I will wait AGES!
1/-1	I am really happy with the way they have talked about this. I myself am quite anxious about that new vaccine. I am otherwise not opposed to vaccines.
1/1	I am really looking forward when the countries are vaccinated 100%
1/1	I am really looking forward when the countries are vaccinated 100% so happy love your inspiring and beautiful knowledge you gave me so I can explain all my friends
1/1	I am really proud to I say that I live in a country where vaccines are free for everyone
1/1	I am really proud to I say that I live in a country where vaccines are free for everyone ...... I just wish people were more educated about the advantages of vaccine
1/1	I am responsible for her health. I know that immunization will strengthen her immune system which will help her fight other diseases.
1/1	I am sad for his family, but also sad about all of the wasted resources in the hospital used to try to treat an un-vaccinated person who could have gotten the vaccine for free and saved his own life.
0/0	I am safe. thinking you are not safe lowers your immune system. an experimental mRNA vaccine is not the answer. how about finding out how many people will take it b4 investing. should you be able to invest in health? seems kinda wrong. mandatory vaccines is tyranny.
0/0	I am saying no to the COVID-1984 shot. Wait a few months and you will see why.
0/0/0	I am scared because I never had it
0/0	I am scared of needles and that is one of so many reasons I won't get a vaccine
0/0	I am scared of the shot and everything that goes with it
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I am scared to. I am also scared for my friends and family i was told 2 doctors died cause of the vaccine.
0/0	I am sceptical to the vaccine when it hasn't been tested for a long time
0/0	I am scheduled to take Moderna- but I am not feeling peace in my heart to take it..
0/0	I am selflessly refusing a vaccine to make sure a person of color gets it before my privileged self. After all, we don't know all of the effects.
1/1	I am seriously hoping this vaccine works, is safe, and can be mass produced as fast as possible for the sake of the entire world. Really rooting for this ‚Äî and all the other ‚Äî teams.
1/-1	I am shocked but not surprised there are anti-Vaxers in the Valley telling people the COVID vaccine will alter their genetic makeup and make them sick. That‚Äôs no good, friends.
0/0	I am shocked that you would get it. Do they know the long term effects of it? 5 years? 10 years? They have only been working on a vaccine for not even a year. It is quite disturbing that they pushed it out so fast.
1/1	I am sitting in observation as I write this, just got my vaccine a few minutes ago. It feels so surreal, honestly I've been holding back tears since getting my approval yesterday. I can't even imagine yet what the relief will feel like in three weeks. I hope everyone will get this opportunity soon, I know I am very lucky and privileged.
1/1	I am sitting out my 15 minutes after getting Pfizer dose 2 rn. Pfizer gang ü§ò
1/1	I am so excited for my child to be protected from this virus.
1	I am so excited for these vaccines. They are a light at the end of the long tunnel for those of us who have auto immune diseases and have been living in a bubble.
1/1	I am so excited to get my first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine
1/-1	I am so excited. I have the opportunity to receive a shot of a newly developed vaccine which is at best 95% effective on certain variance of the Covid-19 virus or at worst give me a blood clot. All for a 98% survivable disease. \n\nWell, it is a price we all have to pay to re-join the society or to make people \feel\" safer, I guess.",
1/1	I am so glad more people in the U.S. will be able to receive this vaccine.
1/1	I am so glad we have Dr. Fauci. A man of reason.

1/1	I am so happy to have taken the step and got the shot.
0/0	I am so happy to read the comments because I didn't see one that was in favour of this poison.
1/1	I am so happy you have had your shot. I have coworkers who have had it twice now, and others who know people who have had it twice. Even if you have had covid it is still worth it to get the vaccine, it will still have good coverage of new strains that will develop.
1/1	I am so incredibly thankful for them and all the people helping to end this pandemic and when it‚Äôs my turn I‚Äôll get a vaccine
1/1	I am so jealous, here in the UK it will be months before I get a chance to be in line. I am 23 years old so I am at the back of the line. It is even worse for the country were I am originally from *sigh*.
0/0	I am so not taking this vaccine I am allergic to everything including sky news
1/1	I am so pleased to know that the world is getting the vaccines we all need. Thank you unicef.

1/1	I am so stoked! I am 15 weeks pregnant and have had both of my Pfizer shots. I am really hoping my baby will have antibodies when born, this is wonderful!
1/1	I am so surprised there is so much anti vaccine sentiment. The adverse event is extremely rare if you comparing with medicines on the market already
1/1/1/1/1/1	I am so surprised there is so much anti vaccine sentiment. The adverse event is extremely rare if you comparing with medicines on the market already.

1/1	I am starting to be safe with this vaccine and no more symptoms of covid
0/0	I am still going through INFLAMMATION from the Moderna vaccine. These should be a CHOICE! Not mandatory
0/0	I am still not fully 100% sure that these vaccines are necessary.
0/0/0	I am still unsure if covid even exists, so why should I take the vaccine?

1/1	I am still waiting for news when the vaccine will be given to freelance speechtherapists in Austria üá¶üáπ can‚Äôt wait for my shot!
1/1	I am studying health-related courses and I would like to have a positive attitude toward the vaccines.
1/-1	I am supportive of health services, the support they have provided in recovering the majority of any Canadians that have gotten sick, I applaud such resilience in their effort.
0/0	I am suppose to get my Covid-19 shot this friday but something keeps telling me dont get the Covid-19 shot I have read alot of articles about the shot in which several people has had died because of the covid-19 shot so in all cases you have a 50 percent chance of living or a 50 percent chance of dieing this is coming directly from the CDC in which i called today to do some research for myself The CDC also has told me that this shot doesnt mean you are not going to get Covid-19 So I will skip my Covid-19 shot this Friday because i am not putting harmful chenicals in my body that is not going to stop the virus from attacking you
0/0	I am sure as Hell NOT doing it............. lol.
0/0	I am sure your investors and share holders will want a new vaccine for every variant
1/1	I am surprised how many people are willing to take their chances with COVID rather than take the vaccine.
1/1	I am surprised that people say they do not take vaccina
1/1	I am taking a vaccine next week
1/1	I am taking it.
1/1	I am thankful I live in a state that believes in Science and requires masks.

0/0	I am the master of my own health, thankyou
1/1	I am the only doctor in a town of 700 people where almost everyone is anti-vaccine and now a new wave of covid is beginning
0/0	I am the only one that didnt take the vaccine in my family and i feel great.
1/1	I am thinking of the school start in the fall as a reasonable goal. A bummer really, but I am so excited! But my grandparents will get their second dose in the following days, so hopefully I can meet them in the summer! But to the point: every business should be able to demand vaccination for their customer. I have no sympathy at all for people that despite having no reason not to vaccinate choose not do it. It isn‚Äôt about personal choice, never has been. It‚Äôs like not wearing your seatbelt because you‚Äôre afraid of getting seatbelt bruises in an eventual crash.
1/1/1/1	I am thrilled to be vaccinated! May need to take a shot annually, as we do flu shots. That is fine. So thankful for medicine.
1/1	I am tired of lockdown, please take the vaccine, people
1/-1	I am tired of politicians playing science when they know nothing
0/0	I am too scared to take a vaccine because of the side effects
1/1	I am triple vaccinated and tested positive for COVID as well. Had a mild case BECAUSE I am vaccinated. This is also not unusual for other illnesses that we got vaccinated for as kids. A small percentage will get ill despite being vaccinated.
1/1	I am triple vaxxed, so is my husband, oldest teenager, my youngest can't be but has 2. I am immunosuppressed becaus ei have 2 auto immune diseases and take biologic meds. I got covid travelling at Christmas. So mild. Like a mild cold, I felt tired mostly. My 3 family memebers tested each several times...all negative. Vaccines work!
1/-1	I am truly sorry that these brilliant people had to put in that much effort to make a video about something that has been PROVED TO BE GOOD FOR SURE 10000%
1/1	I am trying to seek advice on how to convince my friend to get the vaccine, she is extremely anti vaccination because she says that they do not know "long term effects" the vaccine might have. I feel quite hopeless as I am not a doctor and have not done much research into this, however I have tried to tell her that it is far better than the alternative which is being in the middle of an epidemic like there is in India at the moment. Any advice, articles or help you could give would be GREATLY appreciated.
0/0	I am unvaccinated
0/0	I am unvaccinated. I lost my job late last year, was finding it awfully tough. Contemplated my decision multiple times. Broke down, yet never gave up. Today I am earning more than I was previously. I am not expected to be vaccinated or masked. Proud that I stood my ground.
0/0	I am vaccinated against Polio and Smallpox. I never asked anyone ever if they were vaccinated against these diseases
1/-1	I am vaccinated against anything and everything.
1/1	I am vaccinated and I am alive.
1/1	I am vaccinated and not dead.
1	I am vaccinated because I want to be part of the solution, not part of the problem. The common good matters.
1/-1	I am vaccinated but I still follow -- and intend to keep following -- the guidelines erring on the side if overcaution. Part of it is that I am a high school custodian and my students are not eligible for the vaccine, plus I have elderly grandparents. It is my duty to protect the kids and old folks. Part of it is modeling good behavior for others. And part of it is that I don't want people to flip out on me and, like, demand proof of my vaccination status when they see me maskless.
1/1	I am vaccinated for my protection and others
1/1	I am vaccinated today and my arm sore 24 hour I am very excited to see the end of Corona üò≠üòÇüòÇüòÇüò≠‚ò∫Ô∏è
1/1	I am vaccinated, and so is every member of my immediate family. We believe in science and freedom
0/0	I am vaccine hesitant and nothing they have said has changed my mind. I am still not getting the vaccine. I refuse until I see the long term effects and it seems like the flu shot that you have to get it yearly and I don‚Äôt get the flu shot because I always get the flu when I do and i already had Covid.
1/1	I am vaccine shy (allergic to a lot of things), just got my second covid shot & happy to say I‚Äôm still here! Wasn‚Äôt even abducted by aliens or another adverse reaction.
1/1	I am vaxxed. I feel fine. Same with my family friends and colleagues. I actually feel better, less stressed.
1/1	I am very glad I decided to get vaccinated
1/1	I am very glad that my parents aren‚Äôt idiots and knew to vaccinate me
1	I am very grateful for their groundbreaking research, development, and deployment of the covid-19 vaccine. Thank you.
1/1	I am very happy I hope it will increase I hope there will be a lot, you deserve it so much
1/1	I am very happy that people have the choice of Vax or no Vax and if they want to get ill and maybe die that too is their right. Unfortunately they are tending to clog up our hospitals and denying innocent third parties operations that they have maybe waited years for. I do not think non vaxers have the right to do that
1/1	I am very happy to have an opportunity to get the vaccinations and if that helps my countrymen to feel more secure about taking the shots in the future, well I'm happy to help.
0/0	I am very leery of taking the vaccine I think I‚Äôll wait until we know for sure That is safe
1/1/1/1	I am very proud of our scientists, Doctors, lab techs and all of the folks that are working on these vaccines and Warp Speed. I am a front liner and am ready for them. We have the best scientists in the world. God bless them.
1/1	I am very proud to say that I was part of this Novavax during the vaccine trial as one of the unblinded nurses who gave the injections to the trial participants. So happy to hear about its outcome.
0/0	I am very reluctant to have this vaccine, but will just see what happens to everyone else, in a few months time?. my elderly neighbour had a bad reaction to the first one!.. he hasn't had the second one yet. I hope in a few months, years, everyone will he ok.. but for me it is a no at the moment.
0/0	I am waiting 5 years and then MAYBE I will conside it.
1/1	I am waiting for the vaccine! Waiting for FREE
1/1	I am waiting for vaccin
1/1	I am waiting patiently to be vaccinated. Been super vigilant with safe practices since March.
1/1	I am waiting patiently to get mine. I understand how some of you feel but it‚Äôs a personal choice.
0/0	I am waiting to see one of these ;people get the shot and flop like a landed fish.
0/0	I am white as can be and I will not be taking this experimental pharmaceutical agent completely unlike any previous agent ever given to humans before.
0/-1	I am willing to bet it is a lot more than 24% !
1/0	I am willing to take a 98+% chance of surviving Covid‚Ä¶ :)
0/1	I am worried enough not to want to be at the head of the line for a new vaccine
1/1	I am yet to hear a single logical reason which convinces me that people who refuse to take the vaccine aren't complete nutjobs
0/0	I am, however, saying until a large amount of those people get the vaccine and we have seen how it impacts them, I‚Äôm not getting it. Unless in the next few months research shows that covid itself actively negatively impacts fertility, then I would consider the vaccine. But I would still want to see the research and have some kind of FDA guarantee that it‚Äôs safe for women trying to have children
1/1	I and many friends and relatives have had both Pfizer doses, no side effects.
1/1	I and many of my friends have had the vaccine with absolutely no ill affects or health related issues.... and I am allergic to penicillin. We haven't dropped dead, we haven't grown 2 heads and we haven't had blood clots coming out of our ears. Having the vaccination is the only way out of this mess.
0/-1	I and many others are transplant patients with immunodepressing drugs against rejection
0/0	I and many would rather die than take this poison
1/1	I and my wife got our Moderna vaccines on Saturday at the same place @TheSSEHydro aka @NHSLouisaJordan . Glad to be vaccinated and looking forward to some of the fun stuff we've been missing
0/0	I applaud this doctor, he speaks absolute sense. A highly educated gentleman. Why should people take a vaccine with NO INDEMNITY.
0/0	I appreciate all you do as a nurse and you have a lovely family however I will not get the vaccine it has aborted baby cells among other things in it and several doctors have come out and said it will mess with a person‚Äôs DNA
0/0	I appreciate some of these comments about this video makes me feel like I'm not alone my family and I have been living like hermits and masking of course but because we are unsure of the vaccine we have had friends and family members who are just rude almost hateful towards our decision I was always taught that just because you don't get a agree doesn't mean you can't get along.
1	I appreciate that you guys are just spreading information and incentivizing the vaccine and not advocating for mandates
1/0	I appreciate the honesty of the nurse who likened it to the flu and how it seems to affect the elderly in particular.
1/1	I appreciate the idea of knowing that the people around me have been vaccinated. If people don‚Äôt care about protecting others then they can stay home.
0/0	I appreciate what you do being a part of the healthcare field . But I will not be getting a vaccine. Not now not ever !
1/1	I appreciate you guys, He is okay thankfully double vaxxed so just quarantining at home. But fkn hell he sounds like shit. Will keep you guys posted
1/1/1/1	I appreciate you, Doctor for the insightful video! Thank you for raising awareness about the vaccine and providing your professional opinion. You were thorough easing certain doubts and busting myths. Keep continuing the good job.
1/1	I arrive in beautiful Germany from Australia for work at the end of this month. I am a bit concerned for my safety. I'll try to get the vaccine before I go.
1/1/-1	I ask what is worrying them about it. Then try to gently walk through what we know about the concern & how it compares to COVID. I remind them that vax will help us reclaim what we value, protect vulnerable in our lives.
1/-1	I asked a doctor when they think this virus will end. He said how should I know, I'm a doctor not a politician.
1/1	I assume none of you got it and just use this post to feel better about not getting it. I still wear 2 masks at the hospital but getting the vaccine is a step in the right direction even if it‚Äôs only 95% effective in the laboratory. Trying to not get myocarditis.
1/1	I assume you would go to hospital if you break an arm, a leg or have a significant injury. You would also trust doctors with surgery - which, to be honest, is a way higher level of trust than getting advice on a drug or another. During surgery, they cut you open. One slightly wrong move and you‚Äôre gone. That‚Äôs intense. And yet you don‚Äô trust the same people, and the same science, in regards with a simple jab that is given to everyone else. That really baffles me. 2021, and some people would still rather die than follow basic medical advice, because ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt trust‚Äù doctors. Neanderthal much, isn‚Äôt it‚Ä¶?
1/1	I be having my jab soon , cant wait . Keep up the good work boris üòä‚ô•Ô∏è
0/0/0/0	I became ‚Äòanti vaccine‚Äô when I saw Tiffany Dover pass out. It‚Äôs been a YEAR. Mainstream media said she‚Äôs FINE.. so why isn‚Äôt there a recent update on her? Is she Dead?
0/0	I been having hot flashes for six days. My skin has been burning. It wont go away. I took J and J vaccine. I would never ever do it again.
1/1	I beg of people to vaccine shaming. I have spoken to numerous physicians about Astra Zeneca. They say it is as good or better than Pfizer or Moderna. All you are doing is causing vaccine hesitancy when we can ill afford it.
0/0	I beg parents NOT to VAX their child . It s a slow process to build up their immune system as an infant as God intended let alone START poisoning them in the beginning
1/0	I believe chinese product
1/1	I believe everyone should get one if they want it I believe it should be optional I want my Pfizer shot asp
1/1	I believe in our Doctors Scientist they Find Vaccines And Save Us From Corona But Now We Have To Be safe In Our Home First. And Also This is nice To raise Funds For WHO üòä
1/1	I believe in science and WHO as a health care worker, retired, CDC and local health departments need to be listened to.
1/1	I believe in science so i'll take the vaccine
1/1	I believe in science. I believe in medicine. I believe in vaccines.

0/1	I believe in vaccines but I don't wan't to be the first to get an injection.
1/0	I believe in vaccines but I‚Äôm not willing to take a new and experimental one.
1/1	I believe in vaccines. I believe in wearing masks. I believe in social distancing and, when necessary, stay at home orders.
1/1	I believe in what the people who know about medicine say. If the people say we need to get vaccinated, we need to get the vaccine. If you do this, you don't have any problem to play here.
1/1	I believe it should be required by law to vaccinate our kids. Not only does it protect your child, it also protects people who cannot get them.
0/0	I believe my entire family ,4 generations have never had any vaccine of any kind, all have had Covid and all survived. Intact natural immunity trumps any vaccine. The laws of the strongest survive are true.
0/0	I believe my immune system better than vaccine
0/0	I believe natural immunity is the best!
0/0	I believe that COVID-19 vaccine has something to do with God I know I‚Äôm not taking it just in case I‚Äôm right I love y‚Äôall
1/1	I believe that everyone should have the vaccine as it could keep them out of the hospital and slow the spread of the virus.
1/1	I believe that the vaccines are very safe.
1/1	I believe that there should be a law that you need to vaccinate your child no matter what. If not prison
0/0	I believe the better option is to catch covid.
0	I believe the people not trying to control others through a vaccine passport.
1/1	I believe the regulatory authorities of the FDA. As well, From all open reports (apart from unsubstantiated bald claims of conspiracy lovers) the protection in better than expected and the safety (remembering that the vaccine doesn‚Äôt provide protection from trucks or pre-existing heart disease) is excellent. I‚Äôm vaccinated despite my reservations about the emergency approval and safety problems with feline coronavirus vaccine (FIP). We‚Äôre all guinea pigs to some extent for the first couple of years. Everyone is free to choose the virulent COVID-19 virus with the attendant hazards. Good luck to us all
1/0	I believe the vaccine is a choice!!
1/1	I believe the vaccine is safe. It's proven to be effective. I believe, if you can, you should get vaccinated.
0/0/0/0	I believe the vaccine should me non mandatory MY BODY MY CHOICE
0/0	I believe the virus will find it's way around the vaccine then we'll be in a never ending battle with this thing.
1/1	I believe vaccine very much
0/1	I believe vaccines at one point were effective and safer... but since ppl realized they could profit, I no Longer believe they are safe or effective.
0/0	I bet you anything that it wasn‚Äôt the true vaccine, this is an exercise in getting you to have it. Don‚Äôt!! I sadly don‚Äôt trust them, there is an agenda, and it not about your safety, protection or health!!!
1/1	I booked my two vaccinations today. I am so glad to be able to be vaccinated.
1/1	I buy churros in the NYC subway, I've bought "Nutcrackers" from strangers at Coney Island, I eat tacos from street vendors. Bring on the vaccine
1/1	I buy the AstraZeneca vaccine.
1/1/1	I calculated I was more likely to die in my car driving to get my J&J than from the vaccine itself.
0/1	I came here to tell everyone that i wont be getting it. Also to the people that already got it and are planning to get their boosters , you will die a slow and painful early death.
1/-1	I came here to understand the vaccine and Ted Animation Explain Video is Awesome
1/-1	I can count the times that I would have died, were it not for modern medications---and those are just the things I'm aware of. Grateful for modern times. No "good old days" for me, thank you.
1/1	I can even see less getting vaccinated here. It's not even that they're afraid that it's safe. A lot of it is pure apathy and ignorance.
0/0	I can feel mandatory vaccines are not okay, I can decide I don‚Äôt want one, I can think there is a possibility there will be something in them that makes it easy to track that you have gotten it AND not believe this is not the mark of the beast.
1/1/1/1/1/1	I can finally get the vaccine now
0/-1	I can get the vaccine now if I choose, but from what I've seen I'm a little scared to. Should I get it if I'm young? Do we actually know what this will do long term? Is there actual proof that it is safe? I'm nervous about it.
1/1	I can literally see that this vaccine is working , still we have to wait for at least one whole year to check whether its working or not maybe

0/0	I can live without the vaccine
1/1	I can not see the point in you refraining from vaccination with reference to any health risks
1/1	I can not take the vaccine because of my immunity system, you are lucky you should not waste this occasion of protect yourself from this fucking virus
1/1	I can only dream of getting the Moderna vaccine in Croatia and it‚Äôs the one I want. Those doses are only for the rich and privileged with deep connections
0	I can only speak for myself, but I am against any manipulation of my DNA, because as a believer in Jesus Christ I am obligated to allow god to have his will and not interfere with his divine plan for my life.
0/-1	I can relate to the hesitancy, after I received my covid vaccine. Ispent the next few days hallucinating. That is not an experience I plan on repeting .
1/1	I can say with the greatest confidence, vaccines do not cause autism, and that @CDCgov is in agreement. Ignore the disinformation. Remember antivaccine groups do not care about you or your family
0/-1	I can see the Autism flowing!
1/1	I can take Pfizer or Moderna if available today.
1/1	I can tell that you really wished that you had been vaccinated, and will now only tell bad stories about covid.
1/1	I can tell you from personal experience the Mrs was unvaccinated and got covid was seriously ill and still isn‚Äôt right I‚Äôve had it twice being vaccinated and only had a mild headache for a night and was negative 3 days later but you spouting your pish all over social media

1/1	I can't believe it Corona vaccine is ready
1/1	I can't believe people are coming here to spew anti-vax agenda... just get vaccinated ffs
1/1	I can't believe people are complaining about this vaccine.
0/0	I can't believe people are ok with mandatory vaccination.
1/1	I can't believe people are still complaining about the vaccines, people have side affects to all vaccines and medicines, it's pretty common
0/-1	I can't believe people in general are stupid or weakwilled enough to get it despite the many MANY red flags.
1/1	I can't believe we live in a world where vaccines are questioned??
1/1	I can't belive how selfish unvaccinated people are!
0/0	I can't belive this. My son had seizures after his mmr vaccines. Could this be a coincidence?
0/-1/1	I can't even believe we are discussing such things in our country in this century. I think it will creat a two tier society, sub humans and the vaccinated ones.
1/-1	I can't even imagine the amount of patience some of these medical professionals have to have with these patients
0/0	I can't help but feel we're all being experimented on, socially, morally, financially, ehtically, and every other ally
0/0	I can't imagine any child being excited about having a needle jabbed into their arm.
1/-1	I can't imagine how infuriating it must be to be a doctor/healthcare worker in a society where people don't trust you enough to listen to you but trust you enough to feel entitled to your care when their poor choices inevitably land them to the ICU. - Twitter post
1/1	I can't make myself care if people get sick after refusing to take a vaccine. At that point, it's just not my problem anymore.

1/1	I can't wrap my head around how one can be an Anti-vaccine Activist as well as study Nursing.
1/1	I cannot WAIT for that data about transmission. A lot of the people I speak to who say they won't get it say it's (partially) because "it's only protecting ME. It'd be different if it protected other people." Ok sure. I'll wait. Will love to hear the next excuse after "it's not selfless enough."
0/-1	I cannot believe people think it's odd that one may not want to volunteer themselves for the current covid-19 vaccine human trials.
1/1	I cannot believe that one considers to NOT take the vaccine

0/-1	I cant get covid, I keep trying and wont give up.
0/-1	I cant get covid. I keep trying and wont give up.
1/-1	I cant give specific, individualized medical advice, but a history of thrombocytopenia is not considered a contraindication to the mRNA vaccines. However, any person with concerns about their personal medical situation as it relates to the vaccine should speak with their own physicians who know the full details of their medical history.

0/-1	I can‚Äôt go during the day as I work
1/-1	I can‚Äôt go get vaccinated right now just because I want to. It‚Äôs not public yet.
1/1	I can‚Äôt imagine looking at the global situation for the past two years and deciding the best take is to stay unvaccinated. I wish more people could see pictures and videos of what COVID patients in the hospital look like. I want them to see intubation and sedation. The rotating beds like you‚Äôre cooking human rotisserie chicken. Mention that they are not just tubed in their throat but up their ass and whatever pee function they have. I often wonder if these people had half a clue as to the indignities they could suffer, would they change their minds. Probably not‚Ä¶ but man, am I glad for the two hours I‚Äôve taken since the spring to get three shots to prevent having tubes up my holes and maggots growing in my face. And, you know, living life mindfully but not in fear, like so many assume.
1/1	I can‚Äôt imagine the world without vaccines.

0	I caught COVID from my sister who was showing symptoms after her second vaccine
0/0	I caught Covid very early on. It was like a bad cold that lasted 2 weeks. Ever since then I have been out and about and haven‚Äôt been sick since then. There are studies out there that prove natural immunity is long lasting and stronger than vaccine protection
1	I celebrate the fantastic achievement of scientists in creating this miracle the world so needs. My niece, a virologist herself, volunteered for the Pfizer trials. She did indeed get the vaccine (not placebo) and took an antibody test after which showed the highest levels of antibodies to COVID-19 ever seen at the hospital lab where the test was done! I can‚Äôt wait until it‚Äôs my turn to take the vaccine!
0/0	I certainly won't be having the vaccine never never never ever
1/1/1	I challenge all anti vaxers to go to a covid ward with no protection and take a deep breath near a covid patient.
1/1	I choose life! I choose the vaccine!
0/0	I choose not to get vaccinated because this virus isn‚Äôt a big deal to people who don‚Äôt have underlying health problems like myself.
1/1	I chose to volunteer and participate because I want to help get a vaccine out and I feel compelled to help and contribute to society in regards to this pandemic.
1/1	I chose to volunteer and participate because I want to help get a vaccine out and I feel compelled to help and contribute to society in regards to this pandemic. This Coronavirus Pandemic. Needs to be something of the past and we need to move forward with our lives. Thank you to all volunteers and participants of all clinical trials and to all doctors and nurses. Thank you for this very well instructed video regards to such a sensitive topic!
0/0	I clad i never had any of the jabs , mother nature gave me a immune system for a reason.
1/1/1/1	I commend these scientists working on the vaccine, they wait their whole lives for a chance like this. To put everything they learned in school and apply it to the real world, and help save alot of people.
1/-1	I completely disagree with the opinion that telling emotional stories is more persuasive than presenting data.
1/1	I consider myself lucky and blessed , not only because I get to have this vaccine early but because I am still COVID free.
1/1	I contracted Covid in December, before vaccines were available. I was first in line when I was eligible, for my first shot and then my second. Believe me, not being able to breathe was my motive!
1/1	I contracted Covid in December, before vaccines were available. I was first in line when I was eligible, for my first shot and then my second. Believe me, not being able to breathe was my motive! I still have some after effects 8 months later but nothing compared to what I went through!!
1/1	I convinced my parents to get vaccinated the soonest they became available in the Philippines. They are well and good, my father even went for the booster himself. I hope we also think about other people and get vaccinated.
0/0	I could die if I take this vaccine Some people just say the vaccine helps because the creators say so and that people DON? DO RESEARCH. So no, I won? take it
1/1	I could not get out of bed during covid and go to the fridge to get food.. I love food.. get vaccinated
0/0	I couldn't agree more. I am not taking it. I don't take vaccines at all.
0/0	I couldn't care less what the flogs say..... I'M NOT GETTING IT, END OF STORY
1/1	I couldn't even watch this, because the anti-vax comments were so typically idiotic it hurt.
0/0	I couldn‚Äôt care less about people shaming me, I‚Äôm more worried about the Government forcing it on us, let it be directly or indirectly. It seems that it will go down the path of restrictions for those who did not take the vaccine. First travel bans, then events and who knows, maybe you won‚Äôt be able to go to work or to the grocery store eventually.
1/1	I currently got the vaccine yesterday....I am still alive, and haven't grown a beard or third leg....so after what I have seen and witnessed over the last few months...didnt think twice.
0/0	I currently have covid. I would prefer having it compared to getting that specific vaccine.
0/0	I decide what goes into my body. i am the owner of my body, not the government
1/1	I decided to finally go vaccinated behind my anti-vax parent's back! :)
0/0	I decline SARS-CoV-2 vaccination because I do not think that it is necessary for me. As a rule, I do not take unnecessary medications, because they are more likely to compromize health than to improve it.
0/0	I decline it because of natural immunity. I had a serious case of Covid Pneumonia and endured a lengthy hospitalization. There are now at least 16 professional studies that conclude with no dissenting opinion that natural immunity provides far superior protection against further infection than the Covid vaccines do. Furthermore, natural immunity does not weaken over time, and I will avoid the risk of serious side effects. Lastly, it was concluded that the vaccines could damage important infection fighting T-cells that are unique to those with natural immunity. The bottom line is the vaccines offer no benefit to me, and actually pose a risk to my immune structure.
0/0	I deeply regret my MRNA. Living with POTS caused by it at 40 is worse than having Omicron. Which, I've had too by the way, despite my status ü§ó
1/1	I definitely agree that the majority of us need to get vaccine, even if not for our own health, definitely for others'.
1/1	I definitely am! I trust the scientists
0/-1	I definitely developed bloodclots that I could FEEL after barely even a month on BC, never the fuck again. https://t.co/9JwKaSSRJc
1/1	I definitely feel safe taking this vaccine.
1/1	I definitely had to leave work the day after dose two. That was almost two months ago. Lab confirmed high levels of antibodies now 10/10
1/1	I definitely had to take the day off after round 2 of Moderna. Thats as 2 months ago. Me my staff all 4 of my grandparents have been fully vaccinated. No side effects and lab confirmed antibody immunity. Hooray science!
1/1	I definitely recommend us to take this vacine.
0	I definitely won't be vaccinated. Thank you.
0/0	I definitely won't get it
0/-1	I developed pericarditis after the astrazeneca vaccine. This is supposedly rare. I'm still suffering from it 8 weeks later. Side effects are very real.
1/-1	I did a thing today. So should you.
1/1	I did because they are shown to greatly if not perfectly protect us from a deadly virus that both kills and leaves others with long-haul symptoms and scarred internal tissues.
1/1	I did it Relieved face I got my first shot (out of two) of the #vaccine I was a lil scared and had so tough anxiety, but I came out alright Blue heart and I'm glad to say I'm one step closer to being safe from #COVID19 and helping to end the #spread RoseFox faceSmiling face with 3 hearts
1/1	I did it and I am totally fine and I had cancer and a shifty Amun system and still alive then you need to stop with your bull stop spreading false information and get Educated then start talking I did not hurt the shot it self too less then a minute. But They do ask you to stay about 30 minutes So they treat you if you have a reaction but when I was there there was a bunch of people like 50 and no one got a reaction I‚Äôll be going for dose number two
1/1	I did it because of me mom and dad both elderly. Second I did it because I could go to the pub. Was just a matter of time that you could not do a dang thing before it was a fact. Future foresight perhaps. Not shamed of doing it!
1/1	I did it finally! #CovidVaccine
1/1	I did it so I could travel‚Ä¶. Still painful to do so. Do whatever you want!
0/0	I did not and will not receive any injection because the evidence to the contrary of it being safe and effective is too compelling.
1/1	I did not fever after vaccination
0/0	I did not get the Covid vaccine somethings not right about it now I know it‚Äôs in the vaccine you never explained that she put Covid and the vaccine
0/0	I did not get those vaccines. Lol sorry. Wtf do you know about the outcomes? Nothing. Do you know how bad our education system is? My wife and I are highly educated and our kids will be too. Here‚Äôs a tip‚Ä¶ never assume.'
1/1	I didn't care about people that keep telling me not to get the J&J shot because they think it's less effective. I want J&J because I don't wanna stand in line twice.
1/1	I didn't even second guess rolling my eyes and considering some of those theories out there crazy, thinking the people who belived that stuff must be kinda uneducated
0/0	I didn't get the vaccine and I won't.
1/1	I didn't have any repercussions from the J & J shot...so happy that was my choice
1/-1	I didn't have any symptoms at the time but took a COVID PCR test anyway. The result was negative.
0/0	I didn't need the shot because my perfectly functional immune system sorted the issue out for me
0/0	I didn't need the shot because my perfectly functional immune system sorted the issue out for me.
0/0	I didn't realize that so many were still unvaccinated. Well done fellow gents!
1/1	I didn't want to go through that again so I had both doses of the Pfizer vaccine.
0/0	I didn‚Äôt even take the flu shot so imma respectfully decline covid vaccine shot. If you feel like you need it then do what you gotta do. I‚Äôm not saying don‚Äôt get. I‚Äôm just saying I‚Äôm healthy and feel I don‚Äôt need it.
1/1	I didn‚Äôt expect to be as thrilled or emotional after receiving my first dose of the COVID_19 PfizerVaccine, but here I am
1/1	I didn‚Äôt feel the needle go in when I got it
0/0	I didn‚Äôt get the flu so imma respectfully decline covid vaccine shot
1/0/1	I discussed the vaccine controversy with two people at work who refuse to get vaccinated because they think their risk of contracting COVID-19 is low, the long-term effects of the vaccines are unknown and there is a chance that the vaccine could cause sudden death. I explained that the odds of being killed in a car accident were much higher than sudden death from the vaccine. Turns out that they are not good at math or science. The fact that they are putting themselves and others at risk did not sway them. I tried to go over the idea of heard immunity, but it fell on deaf ears. I am not optimistic that the US is collectively smart enough to achieve heard immunity from COVID-19
0/0	I do NOT plan on taking these EXPERIMENTAL vaccinations! Even now they have to trace you for two years after taking them because the "researchers" do not know what to expect.
0/0	I do agree with that! I won‚Äôt be giving it to my son until they do more trials on kids specifically either.
0/0	I do believe this was rushed. I‚Äôm reasonably healthy
1/-1	I do feel like Squidward in picture number 5 because I got my booster vaccine today.
0/0	I do not believe in conspiracy theories, but after all these pressure with vaccinations you can't help but wonder what lies behind.
0/-1	I do not believe these are the cause of ASD. But I do believe I should have the right to decide what will be injected in my future children's bodies and the government should not be making that decision for me. Even if it was proven they did, I'd rather have a child on the spectrum and having to pay for their care and services then making funeral arrangements.
0/0	I do not blame them for not wanting to take the COVID-19 vaccine because it is rushed way too quickly and it has not been tested very long in clinical trials.
0/0	I do not care about science I care about my body and my choice .
1/1	I do not care, In will get this COVID-19 vaccine. No matter what happens!
1/1	I do not care, only I get the vaccine! There is no time to choose when there is not enough!
0/0	I do not consider vaccines for myself unless the disease is Really serious & not from an obvious nutrient deficiency.
0/0	I do not dare to take the vaccine at all
1/-1	I do not do know the exact data, but a few in a million. Do not drive if this risk level concerns you.
0/0	I do not do the mark of the beast. I'm OK without. Jesus has got my back.
0/0	I do not fear that is why I don't need to take the experiMENTAL vaccine.
1/-1	I do not feel responsible for anyone who chooses a different direction for themselves. So do not judge me. I am vaccinated and that's that.
0/0/-1/0	I do not need the Corona vaccine. I just need to listen to music every day to boost my immunity because it is better and better vaccination.
0/0	I do not need to be vaccinated. I have trust on my immune system.
0/0	I do not object to taking a vaccine that is proven effective. I just do not want to be the test subject that is being used for that proof. Vaccines take years to validate and test so how safe and proved will this be if done in a year or less?
1/1	I do not regret taking the vaccine!
1/1	I do not see what the big deal is. Vaccines are always 100 percent effective and never ever have harmful side effects.
1/1	I do not think that it is random that western Europ√© has more people vaccinated than Eastern Europe. Education's results at their best!
0/0	I do not trust any government or medical vaccine‚Ä¶I would rather build my immune system naturally as God intended. It's against my spiritual religion and my body is my responsibility in my life.
0/0	I do not trust science at all
0/0	I do not trust the vaccine. It takes 5 years to test vaccine. We all get different meds
0/0	I do not trust the vaccine...experts are all wrong!
0/0	I do not trust this vaccine.
0/0	I do not trust vaccines, I am not vaxxed. I have friends and family that got sick after vaccine. I also know people that got vaccinated and they are just fine, I am not wishing anyone bad, but is that possible?
0/0	I do not want a chemical (vaccine) messing with my immune system. I'll boost my system naturally thank you
1/1	I do not want an anti-vaxers child in my school.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I do not want that shot.
1/1	I do not want to spreading the COVID-19 virus to others
0/0	I do not want to take it.
0/0	I do not wish to take any of this. My body, my choice!
1/1	I do plan on getting the vaccine, yes. But this is based on a ‚Äúcost-benefit‚Äù analysis rather than a gut reaction like, get all vaccines!!!!! I am a very healthy, 30-year-old man. The vaccine has reportedly to have some really bad side effects for some people. Even if I get the worst of these, I will be okay because I have no other health problems.
0/0	I do pray they STAY VOLUNTARY!!! I have absolutely NO DESIRE to put that poison into my body, I don‚Äôt care who makes it! I‚Äôm not a sheep and will never be tested on....ever!!! With sooo many natural supplements that WILL prevent C19 and that are far more effective, why would anyone take this risk?!
1/-1	I do research on what motivates people to get the shot in Mississippi. The number one predictor for a vaccine hesitant person to get the shot is to have conversations with people they trust about it. Usually it‚Äôs family but doesn‚Äôt have to be.
1/1	I do some volunteer work and another guy who works there thinks taking supplements to help the immune system is better than taking a vaccine. From listening to him I know he's watching videos on You Tube. I asked one time what will he do if he has a bout with sepsis. Then he just says that we all have to die sometime and leaves it at that and this is his standard response when he has no answer.
1/1	I do support vaccination. But even I wouldn't expect to be wearing a mask.
1/1	I do take the Covid vaccine
1/1	I do think we aren't quite to the point where we have separate rules for the vaccinated. About mid may when everyone is eligible and able to get it in most of the country, I expect a new round of PR about why it's scientifically sound to come out and enjoy life after the second vaccine has taken effect. It makes me sad to see so many deeply caring people be unnecessarily afraid after they're fully vaccinated. These vaccines are the biggest scientific triumph in a generation and everyone should know exactly how great they are.
1/1	I do wonder why folks who are so "don't force me/my rights" folks don't talk more about alternatives to take instead? I have always found that strange.
1/1	I do, millions get vaccinated
1/1	I don t believe in mandating the vaccine but for Christ s sake just get vaccinated. It may not prevent you from getting ill but it will keep you out of the ICU and out of the fucking morgue.
0/0	I don't believe 1 word from the who
0/0	I don't believe a damn thing the CDC says nor the company making it! I'll get the truth! The truth will prevail!!!
0/0	I don't believe a word from anyone associated with WHO/ Gates foundation!!!
0/0	I don't believe a word these people say.
0/0	I don't believe and I'm not taking the Vax. Never ever!
0/0	I don't believe anyone. Don't want it. Too many different opinions. No ty
0/0	I don't believe in scientists! How many times have scientists been wrong? NATURAL IMMUNITY is BEST!
0/0	I don't believe in this vaccine
0/0	I don't believe in vaccines, people who are vaccinated still get Covid
0	I don't believe in you & Your tests, cases, vaccines! You are all pawns of the GLOBALISTS!
0/0	I don't believe the conspiracy theories, but I don't trust the vaccines yet. First let's see how this works out. Imagine something is wrong with it; I'd rather get covid and be done with it.
0/0	I don't believe there is any future for anybody that takes your gmo vaccines...at least not any bright future...people should be smart and avoid it at any cost‚Ä¶
0	I don't believe this for one minute..They are pushing the vaccine, now the booster, now the new covid..its all political bs..
0/0	I don't blame them 1 bit. People are fainting after getting shots,dying and getting palsy. They won't show the numbers. I'M GOOD
0/0	I don't blame them because I will not take it anytime soon. To many unknowns, variants popping up to fast, side effects, not studied long enough.
0/0	I don't call it vaccine hesitatety I call it intelligent decision making.
0/0	I don't care about conspiracy or no conspiracy; I'm not taking it. That's all folks.
1/1	I don't care about political propaganda, I just want to know which vaccine is safe and easy to get. I know that Pfizer has caused 23 deaths in Norway, what about other vaccine?
1/1	I don't care how authoritarian this sounds. Vaccinations need to be mandatory.
1/0	I don't care if people here want to say that there's foil in my ears or something because of their own ignorance and inability to have an open mind but there has been plenty of research that shows that the vaccinated have been passing the virus just as much as the unvaccinated. When you're vaccinated it's harder to notice the virus. The vaccinations due nothing to prevent you from getting covid so why would it prevent you from dying.
0/0/0	I don't care what the doctors and scientists say, these vaccines aren't safe. Please, everyone, use your brain and stop listening to the media and Fauci!
0/0	I don't doubt the vaccine. I refuse it.
0/0	I don't even get the flu vaccine. Haven't had the flu in 7 years.
0/0	I don't fear the COVAIDS plandemic, I fear being taken out while driving by someone having a bad reaction to a chemical injection
0/0	I don't feel like I need it, im 27 and perfectly healthy. Old and weak people can get it first
0/0	I don't get flu vaccines so won't be getting this one.
0/-1	I don't get how come so much proof there needs to be about this if it's so helpful
1/1	I don't get it. A possible issue has arisen with the vaccine, the government is taking some time to run safety checks--how the bloody heck does that undermine confidence in vaccines? If the Biden administration ignored the issue and didn't check, just one single death and all the anti-vaxers would be screaming for his head for reckless endangerment. There are plenty of other vaccines sources and dosages and safety is supposed to be considered in this process.
1/1	I don't get the fear and paranoia towards the vaccines
0/0	I don't get vaccinated because my body formed antibodies after Covid disease that have been consistently high for 1 1/2 years and are over 300 or have now increased to this level and have never decreased.
1/1	I don't get why people would pay to get a fake vaccine card when you could just get the free vaccine...
0/0/0/0/0	I don't give a damn about going to concerts, movie theaters, etc. vs. not taking a vaccine
0/0	I don't give a frick if I get sick, it's life and I won't be taking the vaccine
0/0	I don't give a fuck what they say, I ain't getting the vaccine.
0/0	I don't give a shit. I'm not going to be forced to take an experimental vaccine for a mild virus.
1/1	I don't give two tugs if I get covid and die. But I refuse to spread the disease to other people, so I got the damn vaccine.
1/1	I don't go on dates with anti-vaxxers
1/1	I don't have any more worries and will take it.
1/1	I don't have any side effect with covishield
0/0	I don't have the flu vaccine, why would I have this?
1/1	I don't know about all vaccines, but polio vaccine in india worked like a charm. I used to see children with polio when I was young, now i haven't seen a child with polio.
1/1	I don't know about the vaccine thing but I hope to get it just to feel better
1	I don't know about you guys but I'm super excited to get my 5th booster!!!!
1/1	I don't know anyone having adverse effects from the vaccines
0/0	I don't know anyone who died of covid, but two of my friends were executed with the vax.
0/0	I don't know anyone who is excited about vaccine roll-out..
0/0	I don't know anyone who is excited about vaccine roll-out.. not gonna take this
1/1	I don't know anything about Rogan but I agree with President Trump about vaccines. Everyone should get vaccinated as soon as possible if you want this thing to be over.
1/1	I don't know how we can get it through people's heads, but the arguments against getting vaccinated, such as "I'm healthy, "I'm young," "I don't have underlying conditions," and so on, are ignorant and selfish. We are at war with this virus, and until we have herd immunity, it's going to keep spreading and mutating into more lethal variants. Can you imagine that if during World War 2, a significant percentage of the draft-eligible population refused to fight? We would have lost the war. The same goes for this war against the virus. This is not the time to whine about personal freedoms and choice. We should all do our part and get vaccinated when our turn comes. Let's inject a little more personal responsibility and civic duty into the narrative.
1/1	I don't know shit about vaccines. But experts say, it is ok to get it. So wenn my turn is coming, I'm getting it.
0/0	I don't know the long-term effects of these vaccines therefore I can't take it
0/-1	I don't know whether that applies to the 5- to 11-year-olds.
1/1	I don't know who needs to hear this but Polio and smallpox never reached natural herd immunity. They were eradicated by vaccines.
1/1	I don't know why this is so hard to understand for them. One person being vaccinated works for that person, but it doesn't do anything in the grand scheme of things. For vaccines to work on a large scale, as many people as possible need to be vaccinated. If only one person had been vaccinated for smallpox, that would've done absolutely nothing for humanity as a whole.
1/0	I don't know why, because obviously any death is still a terrible death, but the healthcare worker deaths from covid now seems somehow worse, because they would have been so close to getting their vaccine
0/-1	I don't know. Not so many people died from flu. The virus is real. My main concern is not even about efficacy of vaccine but about side effects. Suddenly the news in MSM about deaths after vaccination have vanished. What we see is apocalyptic headlines about second waves.
0/0	I don't known if ( WHO) want to reduce the world population.with the covid vaccination program people are dying every day .
0/0	I don't like getting shots and you can't make me. End of story.
0/0	I don't like the vaccine, because it is experimental
0/0	I don't listen to nonsense, leather tell the world how to protect them self, instead of vaccine
0/0	I don't mask and I didn't vaccinate and now after 2 years I have the Coof. I have had worse flu seasons. Don't be cowards! This isn't the Black Death. I have 99.98% to survive this pathetic bug and so do most of you.
0/0/0	I don't need a vaccine for the chinese virus
0/0	I don't need a vaccine. I'm am not in a high risk group. I have a very small chance of catching this, and a very small chance of getting really sick if I do. Protect the old and weak and let the rest of us get on with keeping the economy alive.
0/0	I don't need a vaccine. Since what you giving people is not really a vaccine.
0/0	I don't need any vaccine coz am okay since starting this pandemic coz my immune system is very strong no any virus can come to me and I believe on Jesus Christ that he will save me and even my death bcome so near then I don't wrry I will die in the name of God
0/0	I don't need gene therapy with no warranty, when the survival rate is 98% without! I will take my chances and keep God's genes in tact the way he made me!
0/0	I don't need or want the vaccine so...where does that leave me? Doomed to never travel abroad again? Coercive bullshit
0/0	I don't need protection from Omicron. I need protection from Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson.
0	I don't plan to get that anymore than the flu shot. I have an immune system for a reason.
0/0	I don't really trust the current vaccine, the company making them has a bad rep because their vaccines had side effect that showed up years later
1/1	I don't respect people who don't get vaccinated for no reason whatsoever and then cry because they get covid hard
0/-1	I don't see the problem. It is not like they were giving a fake shot to people without them knowing. The people that bought it needed/wanted it to save their job, retirement, kids and others with health conditions. There is definitely a market out there.
1/-1	I don't see the step where the microchip is transferred by Bill gates.
1/1	I don't support vaccine passports for average people but if you work in healthcare or nursing homes, I'm sorry but there's no place for you if you don't get vaccinated.
0/0	I don't take flu shot I'm probably not gonna take this rushed vaccine
0	I don't take flu shots and never get the flu. Haven't had the flu in 20+ years. The body is smart and natural immunity just works! Millions upon millions have contracted covid and survived, but they don't want to talk about that part of it. They only want to focus on 1% of severe cases. What about the 99% who get it and still survive!
0/0	I don't take the vaccine.. I go for canabis lol.. Vaccine Is nothing... Those taking vaccine still die..
0/0	I don't take vaccines because I believe natural is best.
0/0	I don't think I really need a vaccine for a disease that won't kill me.
1/1	I don't think I've ever been this excited or even looked forward to geting a vaccine. Shoot me the fuck up.
1/1	I don't think most people realise quite how groundbreaking and massive mRNA vaccines will be. A silver-lining to the pandemic is the fact mRNA technology got the funding and resources it sorely needed.
0/0	I don't think the Vaccine will solve anything. People are so scared because of the media. During the war the Media were not allowed to scare people. I refuse to live in fear and take my vitamins and minerals
1/1	I don't think they should have paused the rollout. The benefit-risk ratio is still massively in favour of the vaccine. We need as many vaccine doses as we can get to reduce deaths and long-term health consequences from Covid-19.
0/0	I don't think this vaccine has been that effective and no one knows how long this booster will last.
1/1	I don't think vaccination should be mandatory for the population at-large, but for people who work with the elderly and immunocompromised? Yeah, it's only a matter of time before it's made mandatory.
1/1	I don't think vaccines are bad but I do think people should have a choice whether to take them or not if they want to experience the virus or not is up to them
0/0	I don't trust Any vaccine where I can't sue the makers if something goes wrong whose going to look after my family !!
0/-1	I don't trust Johnson & Johnson, last time they wanted to 'help people' we had an opioid epidemic. Edit: I'm not going debate the virus or vaccines anymore. Stupidity in people is clear, and not worth the debate.
0/0	I don't trust a vaccine when the manufacturer isn't accountable for its effects.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I don't trust a vaccine when the manufacturer isn't accountable for its effects. Idc how much you lie.

0/0	I don't trust these "vaccines".
0/0	I don't trust these people ,shit looks mad sketchy
0/0	I don't trust vaccine coming from China, Because they are the top liar country in the world,plus stealing land piece by piece in all over the world.
0/0	I don't trust vaccines it doesn't make better..
1/0	I don't trust vaccines made by Big Pharma, so I'm taking this horse dewormer........made by Big Pharma.
1/1	I don't understand how ease of mind alone wouldn't be enough of a reason for people to get it. The science points in the right direction.
1/1	I don't understand how no vax can exist
0/0	I don't understand how people can think that vaccines improve upon the nearly perfect systems we are born with. Being continually injected with concoctions whipped up by chemists in labs cannot be good for you. Annual flu shots, pneumonia vaccines, shingles vaccines, Gardasil vaccine against cervical cancer (that they now try to push on young males). Now covid. How many boosters will they recommend? Your body, your choice. But I don't think so. Not for me
1	I don't understand how they are so angry and against vaccines, but believe in all other things they use that are created by the same science and research.
1/1	I don't understand the anti-vaccine reasoning. This is so backward to me.
0/-1	I don't understand why places can make it mandatory when it isn't known yet if the vaccine prevents spread.
1/1	I don't understand why some people don't even do one. Go on, get vaccinated!

0/-1	I don't want to pump man-made chemicals into my veins rushed to market : SCIENTIST: "We found giving a weak dose and then a strong dose worked better than two strong doses" REPORTER: "Why is that then ? " SCIENTIST : "Well we have no idea how that works actually.." So there's a comfort for you. Even dosing is a mystery with this liquid? Me? Polite "No thank you"
0/0	I don't want to seem like a pessimist but the vaccines that are up for authorization especially the Phizer one seems more money driven than people driven. The 95% effective solution is from 170 people out of 40,000. There is no mention of the side effects. No mention of how this vaccine will interact with other medicines. Is it safe? Can children take it? Will individuals get charged for the vaccine? I don't think there's enough time with this vaccine to know if it's effective or not. There are so many unknowns and it's only fair if these unknowns are answered. No matter how much time it takes. Agape love to anyone that read this comment.

0/0	I dont want it and have no interest in getting it
0/0/0	I dont want your toxic vaccine
0/0	I dont. over 70% of people in the UK who are dying from COVID was vaccinated in September. its a fact https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1019992/Vaccine_surveillance_report_-_week_38.pdf Thats not made up. thats not some conspiracy. these are government findings .an ACTUAL government. I'm very confused here: I thought the vaccine was supposed to prevent you from ending up in the hospital and dying even if you get sick? Soooo how are all these vaccinated people dying in the UK? Most people claim its safe‚Ä¶ yes its safe and effective FOR MOST PEOPLE but i know many people who got the shot and are experiences bad long term side effects. Blood clot.. heart attacks Strokes‚Ä¶ paralysis.Theres no long term data. and we NEED long term data more than we need to save .01% of the population who already has health issues., and the MRNA. type vaccines can penetrate the blood brain barrier.. as well as causing heart issues and blood clots. One of the creators of those type of vaccines admitted that personally I have no problem with previous vaccines e.g Flu. Smallpox, pnemonia and MMR,( as long as you dont take too many as a child at the same time- which can cause autism from the thimerasol- which is made form mercury - a poison which side effects are identical to autism) ‚Ä¶ I am 100% against the COVID vaccine- and i am a man of science . why because the virus has a very high survival rate and there is no long term data for the vaccines. its foolish to put something in your bodies without long term testing. Theres the answer. deal with it. Facebook and Twitter should be more to blame because they don't allow free discussion. When you violate the First Amendment just because you can get away with it because you're a private company all you do is draw criticism and all you do is doubt everything that the government s ays whether they are right or wrong. The last thing a person should lose in a free Society is a right to speak their mind without being censored Does anyone remember this? it took them 15 years to recall that. Covid hasnt only been exposed to the public for under 2 years now. vaccines have only been around a year. Why is everyone surprised to hear when there has very bad side effects? and its not rare. I repeat NOT rare. UK Government admit that the vaccines have damaged the natural immune systems of the double jabbed.The British government has spilled the beans about that fact that once you get double jabbed, you will never again be able to acquire full natural immunity against Covid variants - or possibly any viruses So let‚Äôs watch the ‚Äòreal‚Äô pandemic begin now!In its Week 42 ‚ÄúCOVID-19 vaccine surveillance report,‚Äù the U.K. Health Security Agency admitted on page 23 that ‚ÄúN antibody levels appear to be lower in people who acquire infection following two doses of vaccination.‚Äù It goes on to explain that this antibody drop is basically permanent.What‚Äôs this mean?We know the vaccines do not stop infection or transmission of the virus (in fact, the report shows elsewhere that vaccinated adults are now being infected at much HIGHER rates than the unvaccinated).What the British are saying is they are now finding the vaccine interferes with your body‚Äôs innate ability after infection to produce antibodies against not just the spike protein but other pieces of the virus. Specifically, vaccinated people don‚Äôt seem to be producing antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein, the shell of the virus, which are a crucial part of the response in unvaccinated folks. In the long term, people who take the vaccine will be far more vulnerable to any mutations in the spike protein that might come along, even if they have already been infected and recovered once, or more than once.The unvaccinated, meanwhile, will procure lasting, if not permanent, immunity to all strains of the alleged virus after being infected with it naturally even just once.Read it for yourself..

An ENTIRE cruise ship full of people who 100% were vaccinated( they had to in order to be on the cruise) and theye had a pretty big Covid outbreak Theres concrete proof right there folks! They got the vaccine and STILL got Covid. Not making this up. So no only are they not 100% effective. they are full of side effects- something even the biggest pro-vaxxers admit- so why take it!?! Why risk getting the side effects ? This is all nothing more than 1 huge gene therapy experiment with billions of eager guinea pigs.
0/0	I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want my DNA altered, thanks

0/1	I don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm taking the vaccine.
1/1	I don‚Äôt believe anyone should be put through a medical procedure without their consent either. This is why I vaccinate. I don‚Äôt want to pass a deadly disease to anyone i may come in contact with and forced to be hospitalized.
1/1	I don‚Äôt believe in mandating the vaccine but for Christ‚Äôs sake just get vaccinated. It may not prevent you from getting ill but it will keep you out of the ICU and out of the fucking morgue.
0/0	I don‚Äôt believe your numbers
1/1/1/1	I don‚Äôt care about ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù so long as I‚Äôm protected against COVID. If others want to reject vaccination, they can please themselves. I‚Äôll be getting vaccinated.
0/0	I don‚Äôt care how safe it is. Me and my family will not be taking it regardless.

1/-1	I don‚Äôt care, gimme gimme gimme!
0/0	I don‚Äôt disagree with you. I just think that we‚Äôd save more lives by not forcing vaccinations and focusing on education, community support, fostering trust and I think forcing even hospital staff to get the vaccine could jeopardize that.
0/0	I don‚Äôt even get the flu shot . No way I‚Äôd get this... I mean how much do they want to pump into people?!?!
0/0	I don‚Äôt even get the flu shot, so there‚Äôs no way I will get an experimental vaccine that I have no reason to get when the data that is out there shows that I am in the 99th percentile of surviving covid.
1/1	I don‚Äôt feel bad for the patients, I feel bad for the nurses and doctors that they have to deal with idiots.
1/1	I don‚Äôt feel controlled by government when I wear a mask or get #COVID19Vaccine any more than I do wearing a seatbelt, deciding not to drink & drive or stopping at red light. I am vaccinated bc I want to be part of the solution, not part of the problem. The #CommonGood matters!

0/0	I don‚Äôt feel sorry for you and others that have been vaccinated. How can a sane person willingly take a poison?
1/1	I don‚Äôt find this shocking at all. This should be universally accepted. There is no excuse to not get vaccinated unless you have some rare health condition which exempts you. We need to stop letting these a holes from bringing back polio or covid just because they don‚Äôt wanna get vaccinated
1/1	I don‚Äôt get flu shots never have. I will get covid vaccine since it does not require annual shots.

0/0	I don‚Äôt know for I‚Äôm not taking the vaccine
1/1	I don‚Äôt know those who have lost their loved ones to COVID will endure watching this.
1/1	I don‚Äôt know why made in India is even important at this point...The public health concerns should override every domestic industry lobby! Providing uniform & timely access to vaccines for a country of our scale is the biggest challenge.
0/1	I don‚Äôt like medicine at all and I‚Äôm also hesitant but I‚Äôm gonna get the vaccine because it‚Äôs the right thing to do
0/0	I don‚Äôt like the two month threshold for the long term outcome effects. Doesn‚Äôt seem right.

1/1	I don‚Äôt need to fear to receive the vaccine. Thank you very much for having this clearly explained accurately on this lecture for this COVID vaccine! Hoping to go back to the normal world again soon.
0/0	I don‚Äôt need to take the Vaccine, I recovered from Covid and I have antibodies. I don‚Äôt want to put something in me if I don‚Äôt need it. CDC just came out with a study recognition of natural immunity after having Covid.

1/1	I don‚Äôt really mind which vaccine I get, it‚Äôs all going in the right direction!
0/0	I don‚Äôt recommend anyone to get the vaccine. I took both Pfizer first and second doses and my body feels very lazy ever since especially when a wake up I get a bad dizziness everyday and I noticed it‚Äôs because of the vaccine plus my body is healthy and I‚Äôm 21 years old and I‚Äôve never felt like this before. There‚Äôs a 3rd booster or whatever they‚Äôre saying but I will never take it. Be careful people
0/0	I don‚Äôt think Ill be taking the vaccine.
1/1	I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll get mine for a long time because I don‚Äôt fit any of the categories but I will definitely get it when it‚Äôs offered to me
1/-1	I don‚Äôt think a nurse should be able to practice when they don‚Äôt believe in medical safety and science.
0/0	I don‚Äôt think about covid because I‚Äôm usually pretty safe around them. We disinfect the desks, use hand sanitizers, and masks.
1/1	I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs wrong yo vaccinate your own people first. It‚Äôs like if you want to help others, you gotta make sure yourself is safe first.
0/-1	I don‚Äôt think so. No to poison
0/0	I don‚Äôt think so.I follow a natural diet regimen where I eat only natural foods as found in nature, with a modest amount of high-quality proteins, supplemented with fermented vegetables and superpowder drink mixes. I live an energetic life style. I stopped taking the annual flu shots years ago and have not had the flu or even the sniffles in the last 6 years.
0/-1	I don‚Äôt think the hesitancy has anything to do with the side effects. It seems to be the quick turnaround of labeling this so-called vaccine with an over 90% success rate when it has been produced in less than a year of the first reported case of the virus
1/1	I don‚Äôt think they should study someone who has fertility issues in the first place. I have no issues conceiving any of my children. I got the vaccine and three months later we decided to try for another baby and I got pregnant on the first try. We have a very healthy baby boy!
0/0	I don‚Äôt think we will even need a vaccine to end this pandemic
0/0	I don‚Äôt trust a rushed vaccine. I got all my shots even flu shots but I don‚Äôt plan on getting the covid vaccine till at least 3 months after it comes available and I see how it goes.
0/0	I don‚Äôt trust any kind of medication or vaccine that has been developed in less than a year and no trail testing? What kind of reaction to this in say 3 months 6 months, a year ? Nope I‚Äôll wait!
0/0	I don‚Äôt trust any of those vaccines I‚Äôve heard of too many side effects with all of them
0/0	I don‚Äôt trust any vaccine that was created in less than a year, especially at the insistence of the Trump administration. I do mask and practice social distancing and have been quarantined, even working from home. So I‚Äôm not ignorant of the disease or it‚Äôs effects. I just trust NOTHING that Trump had his hand in, knowing what a corrupt person he is.

0/0	I don‚Äôt trust the vaccines because they were developed quickly
0/0	I don‚Äôt trust this vaccine
1/1	I don‚Äôt understand the ‚Äúvaccine is oppressive‚Äù thing. It‚Äôs literally just instructions for your body to learn how to fend off a deadly virus. Your body memorizes the instructions and flushes it out of you in a matter of days. These people are insane.
1/0	I don‚Äôt understand what is happening here. 2yrs ago Joe Rogan supported & was behind the science of vaccine. Now he‚Äôs not. WTF happened?
1/1/1/1	I don‚Äôt understand why they don‚Äôt trust the doctor when they tell people to get vaccinated, but they trust the exact same doctor to treat them for the illness they could have been vaccinated against.

0/0	I don‚Äôt want any risks of the COVID vaccine making me artistic!
1/1	I don‚Äôt want anybody to die or get sick but I anticipate a tipping point where most people who have been taking this seriously are vaccinated, and the majority of new sick and dead are those who have been reckless the whole time. At least then the ones being idiotic are the ones paying the price.
1/1	I don‚Äôt want him to die. I‚Äôm angry with him. I appreciate that he has stated how important it is to get vaccinated. I hope he gets well. I just get so tired of hearing that people are dying because they are against the vaccine. What you are supposed to do is get vaccinated and wear a mask and use hand sanitizer. Your babies need you mama. Get well and go home.

1/1	I don‚Äôt want to have covid and not knowing it and murdering anyone I couldn‚Äôt live with myself that‚Äôs why I wear a mask and vaccinated all 3 shots to protect myself and all
1/1/1/1	I don‚Äôt want to say miracle, as seems to devalue the science, but the fact we are about to have two highly effective vaccines to choose from is amazing. I hope the scientists who developed these vaccines go down in history and are never forgotten.

0/0	I don‚Äôt worry about getting sick. I don‚Äôt smoke, I don‚Äôt drink, I try to run each day, stay healthy, eat good.
1/0	I don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt have to. The numbers just show that all vaccines are at least 100 times safer than not being vaccinated. More than a billion people were vaccinated. Nearly 8 times the number who had CoVID. 3.5 million dead of the disease at most 5000 of the vaccine. (5000 is an extreme overestimate overestimate.) 5 in a milllion is much better (smaller) odds than 2 in hundred. I took my chances with the vaccine not the disease.
0/0	I don‚Äôt. It has not proven effective. There is much evidence on the other side of the coin. Check out India. Check out Israel. Sorry, the vax has been politicized and weaponized. Just follow the money $$$$. Natural immunity has been ignored. Home meds disallowed. Ivermectin unavailable. This is a ruse! Some are just too stupid to accept it or two proud to admit it.
0/0	I doubt the vaccines will stop infections and deaths now. To late, to many infected. And even if vaccine does work. China and Russia will invent another virus. The world is doomed....
1/-1	I drink diet coke so‚Ä¶shoot me up too. Stay safe everyone!
1/1	I encourage anyone who is not vaccinated to #GetVaccinatedNow
1/1	I encourage my elder parents to take the vaccine.
0/0	I ended up in the ER after my first vaccine. The symptoms slowly continued to mount up until I couldn't move and was unresponsive.I had to go by ambulance. I really don't think the ER knew how to react. After I started to come around after 12 hours and some sort of treatment, the doctor said he believes it was a reaction from the injection. Still waiting to feel back to speed
1/1	I enjoyed Pfizer vaccine
1/1	I envy you! Congratulations! I wish I had already received this vaccine. By the way, this vaccine was developed by Germany's Biontech, not by Pfizer. Pfizer distributes it and was responsible for the Phase III testing.

1/1	I feel a little safer again myself and protect the people around me.
1/1	I feel a lot better now knowing we are paying top dollar for vaccines arriving long after other Nations have moved on
1/1	I feel bad for a lot of these people that think the vaccine is a hoax. If they had only taken 1 college level biology course they would completely understand how it works and why it was able to be produced so fast.
1/1	I feel bad for doctors and scientists. Imagine spending 4-13 years studying and training and learning only for Stacy from Virginia or Sara from Coventry to call you a "paid fraud"
1/0	I feel bad for the students who complied and risked their health, there now wasn‚Äôt any reason to do so
1/1	I feel bad for those that can‚Äôt take the vaccination. I am sure they are being shamed daily.

0/0	I feel it is safer just to get the virus and move nature run its course, rather than this satanic plan that is going on.
1/1	I feel like Darwin's becoming more and more relevant with all those conspiracy theorists regarding the vaccines.
1	I feel like I've been hit by a truckS√∂mnig #BoosterDose
1/0	I feel like a karen is gunna use the risks of vaccines segment as evidence
1/1	I feel like anyone who is perfectly able to get vaccines should be required to get them unless they have an allergic reaction or disease.
0/0	I feel like it's not safe yet. There hasn't been enough testing done on this vaccine and I don't think that it's a one size fits all.
1/1	I feel like so many of y‚Äôall on here have no idea how vaccines actually work ü§¶üèº‚ôÄÔ∏èPfizer team here!
1/1	I feel like the people that say vaccines work, but choose to not get them are even more insane than people who think vaccines don‚Äôt work at all. Even if the chances are 1/3000 or something similar, the comfort of myself is less important than the lives of the vulnerable (immuno-compromised). This goes along with masks with COVID-19. Even if there was an extremely small chance of it to prevent the spread, I would value that small chance to save a life over my comfort. I personally believe that people who go against this philosophy are morally bad people.
1/-1	I feel like the vaccine gonna slowly pick us off one by one over time so it seems normal
0/0	I feel like they‚Äôre experimenting on us. Like everyone‚Äôs waiting to see what‚Äôs going to happen in the next several months. #LabRats
1/1	I feel like this video is as vital as ever right now. Highlights the absolute importance of vaccines perfectly.
1/1	I feel like this video should be on the evening news everyday to reduce fears of the vaccine and educate the public.
1/1	I feel like vaccines should become mandatory rather than optional (with doctor approved exceptions). Does anyone else agree?
1/1	I feel lucky to be in a group eligible for the vaccine before the general population. The reward greatly outshines the risk. I don‚Äôt think we have to have the vaccine to work in my state, but it‚Äôs irrelevant to me because I want it. I want the protection for myself and my family. But I believe in science. This is the most epic gift science will give the world in my lifetime.
1/-1	I feel no pity for anyone who dies when a treatment was available and they refused it
0/0	I feel sad for anybody who gets the ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù ü§£ü§£ü§£ they putting the disease into u
1/1	I feel sad for people who lacks knowledge about biology lmao. They ain‚Äôt putting diseases in you (lol) they are putting weakened forms of virus and sometimes parts of the virus hull with the glycoprotein so that there will be a proper immune response to produce the antibodies for the virus. Shut up, your lack of intellect is appalling...
1/1	I feel safer knowing that I‚Äôve gotten both vaccinations. But we‚Äôre not yet out of the woods; there is a long way to go before we can expect to return to pre-pandemic life ‚Äî or some of it, at least.
0/0/0/0/0/0	I feel so bad for all the people who are being duped into taking this
1/1	I feel so bad for the hospital staff. To me this is annoying and frustrating but they have to face the consequences of this ignorance and stupidity every day, I don't. I can not begin to imagine how they must be feeling
1/1	I feel so bad for women in the first interview, despite her not getting it, it‚Äôs sad seeing people be in a situation like that, everyone please get the vaccine!!
1/1	I feel so blessed that our community has access to the vaccine & that with each shot given we are able to further protect ourselves and our loved ones.
1/1	I feel so fortunate. I got my 2nd vaccine yesterday Red heart So far, no reaction, not even soreness at the injection site Red heart #vaccine #grateful
1/1	I feel so free being fully vaccinated since 2 weeks ago.
1/1	I feel so grateful for all the scientists and researchers out there doing what they do. I just wish we would spend more of our society's money on research of all kinds so even more could get accomplished.
1/1	I feel so lucky to work in a district that is making vaccinations readily available to teachers and staff! Vaccine 1 done!
0/0	I feel so sorry for anyone tricked into taking part in this experiment
0/0	I feel so vindicated. No jab, healthy living.
0/1	I feel sorry for all young people that have been vaccinated since it is now obvious from the Israel case that it's useless.. but the most important is that pharma and test makers made a lot of money...
1/1	I feel sorry for the kids of anti vaxxers. Other than that, let the anti vaxxers themselves suffer. They're only hurting themselves
1/1	I feel very fortunate that i received my first shot last week. Its been a hard year wondering if the next patient you interact with might have Covid. A good year of wearing an N95 for 10 hours a day, pay reductions and a 6 month partial furlough. At least once a day a patient I have dealt with is positive that either wasn't wearing a mask or was not thought to have Covid (asymptomatic). It was a significant/emotional/happy moment that I know many of my fellow co-workers experienced this week when we got that first jab.
0/0	I feel very uncomfortable in the vaccine becoming mandatory.
1/1	I feel you. Very excited to get vaccinated as soon as I can. We‚Äôve survived this for a year now, I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll get through a few more months
1/1/1	I feel you. Very excited to get vaccinated as soon as I can. We‚Äôve survived this for a year now, I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll get through a few more months :)
1/1	I felt confident that doing so was the right choice, getting the vaccine.
1/1	I felt faint after my first dose yesterday. But ok after a nights sleep.
1/1	I felt flu like after my first pfizer but nothing too bad, just took a lazy day. I'm sure the second one will be worse but I'm still really fucking excited for it.
1/-1	I felt like I learned so much, and cleared up a lot of confusion. Also, the immunology animations were amazing!
1/1	I felt mildly nervous but there‚Äôs lots of conspiracy theories out there, and they‚Äôre designed to sound scary. The vaccines available are safe. I went in there, closed my eyes, and it was over in a flash. And at that point, nothing left to be done but wait.
1/1	I felt perfectly fine afterwards, all three times
1/1	I felt pretty rough but took it as a positive sign that my body was fighting back. I‚Äôd rather feel ill than die, or risk passing it onto someone else who dies. I‚Äôd quite like to get out and about a bit without having to worry about that.
1/1/1/1	I felt rough for a few days after the vaccine, but I'd take it all day long before having Covid. My friend who fell ill with Covid before he could get the vaccine is going through hell. In his words he's existing in between coughing.
0/0	I felt shit before vaccine I feel shit after vaccine. What's the difference, does it even matter? Been ill 20 years.
0/1	I figure humanity has been doing vaccines for a long time already, we have a pretty good idea what works and how to make it safe. Covid killed half a million people in about a year, so I'm definitely more worried about that than a vaccine.
1/1	I finally got COVID this week. I got Pfizer shots in April 2021 and a Pfizer booster in November 2021. This virus is really hitting me hard. Severe nasal congestion, fever, body aches, fatigue. I‚Äôm throwing the covers off because I‚Äôm too hot, then a short while later I‚Äôm shivering. Coughing and sneezing with sandpaper in my throat is miserable. This is the first time I‚Äôve been sick since getting an Apple Watch and it has been interesting to see how my heart rate has been all over the place. I can‚Äôt imagine how sick I‚Äôd be without the shots. It was comforting to see the headlines yesterday that Pfizer and Moderna boosters are 90% effective at preventing hospitalization.
1/1	I finally got my dad who's been a smoker of 50 years to get his first shot last week... He only did it because we haven't been talking much since I moved and he realized I only asked because i loved him.
0/1	I finally got my first dose of the vaccine! It feels really bittersweet to be getting vaccinated‚Äîmy Mamaw got COVID & passed away right before she was supposed to get vaccinated. But I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm able to help protect others.
1/1	I finally had my vaccine this morning! A great system and lovely staff members and volunteers
1/1	I finally had my vaccine this morning! A great system and lovely staff members and volunteers down at Redwood Education Centre
0/1	I finally received my needle today...YES!! It was eezy peezy....I'm just curious though...when does the bleeding from my ears stop...and how big is this tumor supposed to get? Oh well...im sure its just a temporary side effect...the next shot will probably cure that right up
1/1	I finally was able to schedule a covid 19 vaccination for this Thursday.
0/-1	I find it amazing that as soon as the alleged pandemic began, conflicts of interest ended.
1/1	I find it amazing that people are willing to put the lives of doctors and nurses at risk, because they are too cowardly to get the vaccine. You read social media and believe the idiots spreading false information as your uneducated and have low IQ. You anti vaxxers have put the lives of the most vulnerable at risk...... You're ignoring professors at the expense of others lives. I feel ashamed of you all.
0/0	I find it disturbing the "vaccine" ads are the only pharmaceutical ads in U.S. history with *no* side effects warnings. That tells you everything you need to know about how "honest" they are.
1/1	I find it funny that my mother is so concerned with the vaccine being safe, but she has had more nips, tucks, and fillers than a turkey on Thanksgiving. The bleach must be eating at her brain.
0	I find it hard to believe that Covid19 is evolving as rapidly as it is, without having some kind of manipulations. It seems like the moment we are almost done with the pandemic, another variant shows up.
0/0	I find it hilarious that the first ad during this video was a Pfizer commercial lying to us about how many people they're vaccinating.
1/1	I find it horrifying that this video needs to exist. Get a vaccine. It‚Äôs not rocket science. Cry about getting a fever, but deep down realize that a fever is kinda nothing compared to dying with a ventilator down your throat
0/0	I find it interesting that Baseball Legend Hank Aaron died more than 2 weeks after taking the Coronavirus vaccine. #NoVaccineforme
0/0	I find it interesting that people don't give you a hard time about being skeptical about a new drug on the market, but vaccines are somehow completely safe and shouldn't even be questioned. I mean the exact same drug companies that kill hundreds of thousands with prescription drugs are also producing the holy vaccines. This is all common knowledge!
0/-1	I find it odd that our government is extremely generous when it comes to vaccines, but not antibody tests
0/0	I find it odd that our government is extremely generous when it comes to vaccines, but not antibody tests.
0/0/0/0	I find it odd there are no videos of anyone talking about there bad experience...true or untrue???thinking there being blocked
1/1	I find it quite sad when patients give their reasoning as to why they are not getting the vaccine, I hear it everyday. Suddenly everyone is an expert like they‚Äôve studied the virus for years. I will trust the experts who have dedicated their whole life in the field.
1/1	I find it strange how little trust there is in research that has had virtually unlimited funding and support worldwide.
1/1	I find it strange how little trust there is in research that has had virtually unlimited funding and support worldwide. But being anti-science is so hot right now. I guess I shouldn't be surprised. Seems the influencing activities on social media have been a resounding success to disrupt critical systems in our country. Or is it mass-scale Dunning-Kruger effect at play? Sad times.
0/0	I find it very amusing at the fact in every picture of health care workers getting vaccinated, we do not see the actual needle nor it going in. It has been revealed on numerous occasions, with the exact same discrepancies as this example. Propaganda at its finest. all you want with those paid smiles, but you cannot deny nor hide the truth
0/0	I find myself in disbelief how people would even consider this. This is not about health. It‚Äôs about compliance, money and control.
1/1	I find that people who doubt vaccines have no historical knowledge of just how devastating disease has been to humanity throughout the centuries.
1/1	I find the antivax nutters on this sub highly entertaining
0/0	I find the people most angry about those that haven't taken the shots, are those that feel remorse for taking said shots, they want us to join in the fun of any potential long-term side effects.
1/1	I follow a lot of doctors on Twitter they have already gotten their second dose said they had more side effects but nothing major, they said they felt like they do after a flu shot. This was from the Pfizer vaccine. Still can't wait to get mine
1/1	I for one am incredibly happy to have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine!
0/0	I for one will not be taking it. I can't trust this scam. I will wait to see what happens to everyone that took one.
1	I for one will take any vaccine. I dont care if its moderna, phizer of astra.
0/1	I forgot to add that the vaccine is today the best way to spread the Covid
1/1	I fought for months with the antivax and now, when I see their hospitalizations, it doesn't make me hot or cold. I just feel sorry for the nursing staff and give them all my support and love. The others, let them eat shit.
0/0	I found a box of covid-22 Pfizer vaccins from 1998. Absurd
1/0	I found an anti vax shirt for kids, and I wondered if there were any in adult sizes, but I realized it would be pointless
0/0	I found myself an integrative doctor. She is fantastic! She even said the Covid vaccine is bad and she wouldn‚Äôt be giving it.
1/1	I fully support of the vaccine I we always against those people that says bad thing about the vaccime
0/-1	I gave you a like for your positive efforts and your scientific showmanship....other then that, I‚Äôm not taking that shit.
1/1	I genuinely wonder if this anti-vaxx shit will morph into more mainstream anti-healthcare shit, and more conservatives will turn to prayer.
1/1	I get J&J and none symptoms at all
1/1	I get My Covid-19 Shot Tomorrow morning at 9:45
1	I get a flu vaccine every year. I have no problem with getting a booster every year against whatever coronavirus variety is prevalent.
1/1	I get asked this question a lot. The vaccine helps our bodies develop immunity without having to be sick with the virus
1/1	I get first dose vaccines vaccine is compulsory for every people
1/1	I get it to stay alive as I like living and to protect my loved ones and society in general.
1/1	I get mine on Friday!!! I LOVE SCIENE.

1/1	I get my first Moderna tomorrow. I'm a little nervous, but I also just want to get it done ASAP. Glad to hear you had a very mild reaction!
1/1	I get my second Moderna jab tomorrow. The first one made my shoulder swell and I had a pretty big bruise. It went away about 4 days later. I hope my second one goes better.ü§û
1/1	I get my second dose today. With over half a million dead, many more severely injured, and another spike in cases on the way, with hospital beds already full, I am so excited to get vaccinated, thank you very much! I love my life.
1/1	I get my second dose tomorrow! I believe and trust the science and I feel so lucky that I was even able to get it! I‚Äôm in healthcare and I have high risk family members, so it brings me peace of mind
1/1	I get my second jab tomorrow. Pretty excited about it.
1/1	I get my second shot tomorrow!
1/1	I get my second shot tomorrow! Also, the 5G signal has gotten really strong in my city! Thanks everyone
1/1	I get my vaccines on schedule and whenever needed. I don't want to catch death or be spreading it.
1/1	I get really emotional thinking about how much we are capable of solving huge problems if we really put our minds to it. Very grateful to all the scientists, researchers, health workers, and so many more people, who have put in such a tremendous amount of hard work into developing and distributing vaccines in record time.
1/1	I get round one in about 7 hours of the pfizer shot. This makes me really happy
0/0	I get that they want to calm the public and all, but the way I see it, I know what to expect if I get Corona virus: two weeks of suffering that I'll live through. What I DON'T know are the long-term effects of this rushed to market vaccine. No ty, I'll pass.
1/1	I get vaccinated not just for myself but for those who can't get vaccinated
1/1	I get vaccinated. But it is already the third stitch. I don't really care how many are needed. Anything better than a severe corona course.
1/1	I giot the vaccine, no side effects!
0/0/0/-1/0/0	I give my dose to the World Health Organization
0/0	I give my permission now the next person in line can take mine.

1/1	I go tomorrow for my first shot!

1/1	I got 2 booster shots, it works
1	I got 2 covid shots already
1/1	I got 2 doses. I'm not afraid of needles.
1/1	I got 2 shots of the vaccine. Hopefully I will be fine. I pray for everyone to get vaccinated and stop the resistance against the vaccine.
1/1	I got AZ + Moderna for my first two doses and I was secretly hoping to get Pfizer as my booster to complete the set and unlock some kind of achievement/trophy. But practicality won out - I took what was being offered to get a shot sooner rather than later.
1/1	I got COVID last January when I was 5 months pregnant. Landed in the ER after 8 days with shortness of breath. Gave birth two weeks early. Ended up being okay, and baby was fine, and mine was still considered a mild case. Still have taste and smell issues. I wish there had been a vaccine available to me back then. I realize this is somewhat of an echo chamber, but please. Vaccination‚Äîjust consider it.
0	I got Covid ; my relatives and friends70; 80; 60 50 years old with diabetics obese high pressure survived by healing at home just herbal teas and honey. We all eat mostly natural food home cooked or years. We walk 1 h a day Go natural!! Simplify your life .

1/-1	I got Covid, was down for 2 months, recovered well. No long term effects. Loving life.
0/0	I got Covid-19 in May 2020. Never took the jab and don‚Äôt plan too. Been fine ever since. And so has my wife and 3 boys
0/0	I got Covid. I survived. Didn‚Äôt even need a government shot to do so. Almost like our bodies are finely crafted machines that are capable of caring for themselves.
0/1	I got Hep A, C vaccines and yearly Flu shots, there is NO WAY im going to get a Covid vaccine.
1/1	I got Johnson & Johnson vaccine two days ago. I am feeling better today! Two night ago and yesterday I had muscle pain, chills, fiver and very bad headache! I am glad today I am feeling good!

1/1/1/1	I got Pfeizer in March. Every physician I know took it and that‚Äôs good enough for me.
1/1	I got Pfizer a week ago and feel fine, make sure to move your arm around after to avoid soreness
1/1	I got Pfizer and I‚Äôm doing just fine!! I‚Äôll do my part to protect my self and other people around me ‚ù§Ô∏èlet natural selection take it‚Äôs course. RIP
1/1	I got Pfizer and have had no side effects.
1/1	I got Pfizer with no reaction. Scheduled for 2nd shot.
1/1	I got a COVID-19 booster as soon as it was available where I live. This is because I am a responsible adult and do not want to get sick or get other people sick
1/1	I got a really bad fear of needles but I STILL go donate blood (yes I have a PA every time but I donating saves lives so..) and will get the vaccine
1/1	I got a sore arms for a few days and that was it. All of this wailing for nothing. I would still never tell my mum I had it done though, don't want to deal with that conversation!!
1/1	I got a vaccine at the Javits Center in Manhattan 2 days ago, and they gave out 8000 vaccines that day. From entry into the building to shot in arm was 11 minutes. Incredible.
1/1	I got all three of my shots as soon as I could & helped several family members get theirs, not only to protect our health & livelihoods, but the wider community & the healthcare system, and because it's the only chance we have of returning to normalcy.
1/1	I got all three of my vaccines. I'm a senior and the effects were very mild.
1/1	I got boosted and had absolutely no side effects. Its the same as the first two vaccines, you can still get sick for a day. If you‚Äôre scared of one day of bad side effects you should be more scared of covid itself.
1/1	I got both Moderna vaccine doses. I am fine.
1/0	I got both Pfizer vaccines and I never had a single problem other than a sore arm the next day. This was about 3 months ago now. My entire family except my grandpa (who got moderna‚Äôs instead) got Pfizer and was perfectly fine.
1/1/1/1/1/0/1/1/1	I got both doses last year. For the first shot, my arm was just sore for a day. The second dose was a little bit unpleasant. Had a slight fever and runny nose for a day, but after that I was alright again. Till now I haven‚Äôt gotten sick, so that‚Äôs good! Stay safe everyone!
1/-1	I got both doses last year. Till now I haven‚Äôt gotten sick, so that‚Äôs good!
1/1	I got both doses of the pfizer vaccine.
1/1	I got both doses of the pfizer vaccine. I'm doing fine. I'm so happy they're going to do this for kids. They need to be protected too.
1/1	I got both my jabs and I was fine and Covid scares me and I had a friend who was anti vaccine and kept saying I‚Äôll be fine and that I‚Äôm not putting strange toxic things into my body back in August she got Covid and sadly passed
1/1	I got both my shots because I work in a hospital and I'm perfectly fine. Don't be frightened. Trust in science. Thank you President Biden!
1/1	I got both of my doses and my parents are gettkng their first one vaccine. The year is going in the right direction
1/1	I got both of my shots. I hope everyone get theirs. Stay safe.
1/1	I got both of my vaccines. The first covid shot was a piece of cake. The second shot made me feel drained and fatigued for 2 days. I have no regrets about getting my covid shots. It has given me a sense of relief. Although its not 100% it is 95% and I would rather have that than 0%.
1/1	I got both shots back in April. and I'm fine. You're all paranoid...
1/1	I got both shots for pfiezer. Arm was sore for a day or two. Literally the only side effect. My siblings got sick when the got it, but they laid down for a day and were fine. Y‚Äôall would rather get a life changing and destroying disease then have a sore arm or have to take a sick day?
1/1	I got both shots last Spring, and the booster in October. If a fourth is called for, by science, I'll get that, too. The mandatory use of masks on public transportation ends on March 18th. I'll still bring it along if the places I'm going extend beyond then.
1/1	I got both shots one and two this past month and I only had slight body pain for a few hours
1/1	I got both vaccines, the worst side effect I got was 1 night of a slight fever. I wish everyone would just take the vaccine so we can live normally and safely again
0/0	I got covid and I know lots of people who got it. It wasn't bad. Flu is worst. Won't taking any vaccines. Good health is the best protection no vaccines can beat it.
0/0	I got covid and so did my family. Non vaccinated, all alive and healthy. Vaccine doesn't make a difference. It's an individual thing.
1/1	I got covid in February but I was perfectly fine because I‚Äôm typically healthy, but I‚Äôm not gonna think for a second everyone will be as lucky, humanity is lacking with the one ‚Äúanti vaxxer‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt even care.
1/1	I got covid last July/August and I lost all ability to taste/smell & about 2 weeks ago I FINALLY was able to taste/smell. Pleading face it was the absolute worst experience ever! It‚Äôs not 100% bt something is somethin #FckCovid #Vaccinate
0/0	I got covid while unvaxxed, still unvaxxed and will remain that way!
1/1	I got covid19 last week, I had weak syntoms! thanks to the vaccine, i will take my booster shot in 2 weeks
1/1/1/1	I got dibs on the first vaccines. You dumfucking boomers have never taken a biology class in your life that‚Äôs why you guys are so paranoid that the government is out to get you
1/1	I got dose 2 of my Pfizer Covid vaccine yesterday yeah.
1/-1	I got first dose vaccinated and the side effects was a very light fever and headache
0/-1	I got infected while vaccinated, I know
1/1	I got it because I don't want to get covid. Just like I got a lot of other vaccinations because I didn't want to get the disease.
1/1	I got it done despite my trypophobia
1/0	I got it on Monday. Now I'm dead.
1/1	I got it today, I'm very hopeful this is the best vaccine so far
1/1	I got mine (Pfizer) last Wednesday. No sore arm or side effects. I expect the 2nd one will include side effects.
1/1/-1/1	I got mine (Pfizer). Went to work like normal afterwards. Just hung out in bed all day the following day, felt no worse than had I gone to the gym. Dose 1 my arm was immediately sore, but I didn't even feel dose 2 until the constitutional symptoms began. By day 3 after the 2nd dose, I was perfect. If you're lucky enough to have the vaccine available, GET IT!
1/1	I got mine feel great. Been 2 weeks
1/1	I got mine right away with no hesitation. For myself and to protect family also others.
1/1	I got mine today at the local volunteer fire department. I made an appointment online and got the shot in my car. Took about 15 minutes.
1/1	I got mine today at the local volunteer fire department. I made an appointment online and got the shot in my car. Took about 15 minutes. Then they had you queue up in a parallel line of three cars and advanced the queue every 5 minutes. That gave a 15 minute review time and people were walking down the lines to check if you were OK. No cost at all. The shot was free and the VFD administered the shot for free. And it was J&J, so one and done.
0/-1	I got mine yesterday My arm hurts and I feel like I have the flu.

1/1	I got my 1st jab today,with sinopharm vax.I can say that it goes pretty well without having pain the moment doctor inserted the needle,a little bit numbness after few hours and that's normal side effects of any vaccine...
1/1/0	I got my 1st moderna shot last month. Getting my 2nd shot this month. Can't wait to get the micro chip with my 2nd shot. Will Bill Gates talk directly to me through the micro chip???? Hm. I wonder how he's going to control my every move???
1/-1	I got my 2nd Moderna shot yesterday. I have taken the day off of work and have been in bed all day with extreme body aches, headaches and fatigue. I experienced the same symptoms from the first shot
1/1	I got my 2nd covid vaccine dose 2 days ago. I got chest pain & sharp lung pain the following day. Have had body pain, mainly lower pack pain since. No fever no chills. A lot of body soreness and currently a sore throat. Hopefully this is it and nothing worse comes.

1/1	I got my first Pfizer shot on Monday. Tuesday evening I started feeling the effects. Stomach ache, headache, general blah. I feel much better now. Not looking forward to the side effects of the second shot, but definitely better than the alternative.
1	I got my first Pfizer shot today, and it is such a relief! The emotional responses I've been feeling are greater than I imagined they would be, which I suppose is a symptom of the latent stress from the past year. My second shot is already scheduled, and if you've read this far, you should get your shot, too! We're all in this together.

1/1	I got my first Pfizer vaccine yesterday. So happy to be among the first!!

1/1	I got my first covid shot two days ago, it didn't really hurt. It's like if you pinch yourself with your fingernail.
1/1	I got my first covid shot two days ago, it didn't really hurt. It's like if you pinch yourself with your fingernail. Sure they do it fast, but it's better than slow when having a needle being sticked into you. Also, here is a tip: when getting a shot, try not to tense up your arm or wherever it is supposed to go, it will make the pain worse. (Basically saying, that don't move the specific area or put to much work into it)
1/1	I got my first covid-19 vaccine today, and like all ‚Äúlate to the party‚Äù instances in my life, I‚Äôm alone in my excitement.

1/1	I got my first dose yesterday. I'm so glad to have some protection from the Pandemic. I look forward to completing the cycle so I can be fully protected.
1/1	I got my first dose yesterday. I'm so incredibly grateful to live in a time and place where this is possible. I recognize my privilege and I'm simultaneously saddened that others will have to wait so long for theirs. In my community, vast amounts of vaccines have been (and are being) dumped because so few people are willing to take the risk of a new vaccine.

1	I got my first shot 3 weeks ago. A few hours later my arm was a little sore. It lasted about a day and a half. Moderna
1/1	I got my first shot ALREADY, just a sore arm. It's too new is the reason. You understand all vaccines are new at one point right!? Don't get the polio vaccine either, have fun with THAT
1/1	I got my first shot DEC 23. Saturday my coworker tested positive, my boss test positive Tuesday and my other coworker test positive Thursday. I tested negative Wednesday! I think it works and we should push as much to have it.
1/1	I got my first shot Feb. 17th. They still had 5 doses left at the end of the day if someone wanted a walk in. By that evening my arm was good and sore but went away rapidly the next day. I even had a little bit of a sore throat, but only 24 hours, then gone. I have lots of energy and continued to feel good overall after the vax. I will continue to wear a mask, but I can't wait to eat in restaurants again. Payday Monday!
1/1	I got my first shot a week ago, and I am waiting for the second. I would advise everyone who has not, sign up for yours asap. Many states have open vaccination to all adults.
1/1	I got my first shot of anti-covid juice the other day, and I just want all the anti vaxxers out there to know: I'm fine. And I had autism BEFORE I got the vaccine.
1/1	I got my first shot of the COVID Vaccine Smiling face with heart-shaped eyes #CovidVaccine #vaccine
1/1	I got my first shot on January 3rd. I felt every side effect except for the swollen lymph nodes from day 2-6. It‚Äôs day 7 now and I‚Äôm feeling back to normal. I get my second shot on the 25th This is way better of an option than catching Covid-19

1/1	I got my first shot today (Pfizer). I am a doctor and work in long term care homes so I was higher on the priority lists where I live and work. Other than soreness in the arm, no side effects. Feeling very relieved and hopeful.
1/1	I got my first shot yesterday and this video was very interesting. My dad spoke to me and told me that it could also possibly end like a virus in Singapore. When he was in 6th grade, everyone had to get a vaccine. Slowly, when everyone had, the virus died out! Also, thank you for your videos, they‚Äôre very interesting and helpful. You got me into science and explain things in simple ways for people who are just starting as well! :)
1/1	I got my first shot yesterday. I believe in science also! Thanks for being part of the solution, JR.
1/1	I got my first vaccine shot yesterday. I will get the second dose in February! So happy I got it!
1/1	I got my first vaccine today and I‚Äôm relieved!üßø As always, we will have the people who are hesitant (which is completely understandable), then we have the ranting fools who think they know it all and are constantly spewing negativity and false information. This country cannot move forward if we take 3 steps backüòí
1/1	I got my first yesterday and other than my arm being sore it was no big deal so far.
1/1	I got my fist one a week ago. Why? Because 1. I don‚Äôt want to get covid and die. 2. I don‚Äôt want to have covid and be sick. 3. I don‚Äôt want to give anyone covid and they die or be sick. 4. The more people who are vaccinated, the fewer hosts are available for it to mutate into something that the vaccine can‚Äôt protect against, of us more contagious or deadly. And 5. It protects against covid and I don‚Äôt want covid.
1	I got my fist vaccine shot yesterday. Was in and out, no problem. Only a sore arm this morning. I‚Äôm good with that. I would much rather be sick from the shot for a couple of days, than in a hospital with COVID for weeks.
1/1	I got my moderna vaccine today!
1/1	I got my my second shot 3 days ago. I've had no problems. Rock on, Doc!!!
1/1	I got my one-dose Johnson and Johnson vaccine today!

1/1	I got my second 2 days ago. Thank you
1/1	I got my second Covid vaccination this morning (5 hours ago) . So far I haven't had any side effects, not even a sore arm. Now I can be part of the solution not the problem.
1/1	I got my second Moderna shot last week!! I felt like total trash for a few days, and I have some pre existing issues in my nervous/immune systems. Almost a week later I feel pretty much back to normal. Please get your vaccines so we can get back to living!! ‚úåüèªüíï üòÉ
1/1	I got my second Moderna shot today. Not much of a line for the drive through and only a short wait. I just hope that means everyone is getting the vaccine and not refusing to get one.
1/1	I got my second Moderna shot yesterday. I‚Äôve never been so happy to feel like such shit. Looking forward to a booster in the fall, side effects be damned.
1/1	I got my second Moderna shot, I have a sore arm. I am stocked up on spicy ramen for the week. Nothing compared to what actual Covid-19 was like (pure hell).
1/1	I got my second Pfizer Covid vaccination this morning (5 hours ago) . So far I haven't had any side effects, not even a sore arm. Now I can be part of the solution not the problem
1/1	I got my second Pfizer dose on the 28th and today I can eat at all the restaurants in Portugal and be less scared for my family‚Äôs well being
1/1	I got my second Pfizer dose on the 28th and today I can eat at all the restaurants in Portugal üáµüáπ and be less scared for my family‚Äôs well being. All of us got vaccinated with Pfizer, Moderna and Jensen and we are all ok
1/1	I got my second dose Friday and am 9 weeks pregnant. Without question the best decision for me. I know it is minimal, but I do want first trimester mamas to know that pregnancy fatigue + vaccine fatigue is absolutely incapacitating for about 2 days. It is worth knowing so you can prepare.
1/1	I got my second dose four days ago in the Cayman Islands. I am 60 years old. Other than a slight discomfort on my deltoid the second day I had absolutely zero side effect from the first or second dose. Few people I spoke way around my age claimed weakness for a few days, slight headaches and obvious but tolerable pain on their shoulder after vaccination. I also spoke with a few people who were cancer survivors with no threatening side effects after vaccination. We have vaccinated over 20.000 people here in Cayman and there has not been any threatening situations whatsoever.
1/1	I got my second dose of Moderna yesterday morning and I feel like I've been hit by a bus. My whole body is aching and I have the chills. The first shot didn't affect me at all. UPDATE: I'm still alive lol I feel perfectly fine now, the body aches lasted for only a day
1	I got my second dose of Moderna yesterday morning and I feel perfectly fine
1/1	I got my second dose of Pfizer 12 days ago. Little symptoms just slight body aches and one night of bad sleep. I am very happy to get a vaccine and to not risk getting Covid and having to quarantine for 10 days.
1/1/1	I got my second dose of the Pfizer Vaccine this past Monday, I hope this video helps others to make an informed decision to get vaccinated, stay safe everyone & lets stop the spread together.
1/1	I got my second dose on the 7th of this month. My work place asked about vaccinations on sight, and some people are scared about it. But low and behold the CDC passed the no mask for fully vaccinated people and next week I am able to go mask free at work. Overall I didn't get the vaccine because of not wearing a mask, didn't do it because of family because they got vaccinated. I did it for me, yes I am more scared of the long term side effects of covid then the vaccine.
1/1	I got my second dose today. I‚Äôm relieved
1/1	I got my second shot 2 days ago, I hope everyone follows the health recommendations.
0/0	I got my second shot. I‚Äôm sick af and very very very upset about it and wish I didn‚Äôt get it. My immune system wasn‚Äôt ever weak. I got H1N1 and I felt worse than I feel now, but I never needed a vaccine for it.

1/1/1/1/1/1	I got my vaccine 2 days ago!!!
1/1	I got my vaccine already good to see everyone coming together to encourage people to get vaccinated.
1/1	I got my vaccine and I advocate for other to get vaccinated but this seems like we re headed down a path you can t come back from by forcing people to get vaccinated. Idk but this doesn t seem like cause for celebration
1/1	I got my vaccine and didn‚Äôt get anything. They are good.
1/1	I got my vaccine at Fry's on my way home from work, a 30 pack of beer. I was in and out pain free.
1/1	I got my vaccine booster yesterday, and it works great!!!!
1/1	I got my vaccine last week myself. I hope I don't get sick any time I the future
1/1	I got my vaccine last year on November. And then I was fully Vaccinated. Yes I did got somewhat sick but it got better again. Same with the second one. But it sucks that I end up getting covid because of my brother who got it from work. but he didn't get vaccine.. he had it worse.. and am surprised he still alive.. me and my daughter is fully Vaccinated. But we end up getting covid. Ya I didn't get sick I did get medication and my daughter got slight sick but not dangerous. it's been hard for the both of us.. but we are staying home. People should be Vaccinated.. it well save your life.

1/1/1/1	I got my very first shot of modera today. Nothing. Just a headache. But, working Two Jobs, always around the public, That's just everyday life for me. I am however, Not against people who don't want it. It took me everything I had in me to get this. I did my research, I understand the risk. I understand it's not approved, I research. It's a personal choice. People need to stop spreading lies & fearing people as well.
1/1	I got one last Thursday I had zero side effects.

0/0	I got sick with flu shot so I‚Äôm considered if I would get sick when so many have gotten sick my husband is Democrat and republican and both don‚Äôt want it it‚Äôs not about trust at all it‚Äôs the long term affects a lot of people prefer the natural way
0/-1	I got side effects from watching a bit of this. Found the cure. Bye !

1/1	I got the #JohnsonandJohnson vaccine the first week in March and I felt rotten the first few days but there was nothing else out of the ordinary. Since I had COVID in December I haven't felt the same either, though, but that's another story altogether.
1/1	I got the 1st of the two doses so far. Grateful.
1/1	I got the AZ Vaccine today. I'm glad I got these side-effects. It means the vaccine is working!
1	I got the COVID vaccine and felt really ill after the second shot. I‚Äôd hate to know what would‚Äôve happened if I had been sick for real.
1/1	I got the COVID vaccine. I had some side effects, which included fevers, chills, muscle aches, and a headache. It went away after Tylenol. It is important to note that you should take Tylenol after the vaccine and not before, as this may interfere with the immune response. The COVID vaccine is safe and effective.

1/1	I got the first dose from the pfizer vaccine, the only thing i feel is tiredness
1/0	I got the first dose of astrazenica and that evening I was not in a good way. I expected to feel a little flu-ish and had been warned as such. Mild headaches, some aching joints, maybe some mild nausea. Instead I ended up shivering so badly the bed was shaking and my back felt like someone had clubbed me with a metal pole repeatedly. Thankfully it passed once I managed to get the fever down and go to sleep. but yikes. I suppose though, knowing my body reacted that badly to a bit of protein shell, how bad might it have reacted to a real live virus? Not worth the risk thanks. I'll be having my second shot in May and hopefully it won't be as bad.
1/1	I got the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine along with my mom and I go back on March 28. The only side effect I had was a headache and a little soreness where the injection went. Otherwise I'm fine.
1/1	I got the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine yesterday. My arm is a little sore but that's about it. Also, I was a little fatigued a few hours after the shot but that might be due to the fact that I'm an old man.
1/1	I got the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine yesterday. My arm is a little sore but that's about it. Also, I was a little fatigued a few hours after the shot but that might be due to the fact that I'm an old man. Oh! One more thing ... the 5G microchips in it have really improved my cell reception.
1/1	I got the first dose, I have sore arm, slight fever and chills but I know the benefits outweigh the pain. I don`t know if the scientists read this but please stop torturing those poor animals in the lab by injecting them with this painful vaccin, sticking a swab in their nose to see if they have covid! I know as a human is gonna do me good but animals don`t know, for them is torture. Aren`t we humans cruel, to save our species we inflict so much pain to others :( I just want to say a big thank you to all those poor lab animals and hopefully they didn`t die in vain and this vaccine will work and they are done with testing more trials on animals.
1/1	I got the first shot of the vaccine guys !
1/1	I got the first shot yesterday and feel fineüôèüôèüôèüôè
1	I got the first vaccine to protect myself, but I'm not crazy about the idea of yearly booster shots like we have with flu. If we can get to a point where the virus turns into essentially another "flu" that mostly just older and immunocompromised people need to get vaccinated against, I can live with that.
1/1	I got the flu shot today and cannot wait for the covid vaccination. Thank you so much for this vid! Take care, stay safe, and have a happy new year! With lots of love:)
1/1/1/1	I got the flu shot. I‚Äôm still alive. How is this any different? I‚Äôll take the vaccine.
1/1	I got the jab(s) to protect the ones I love and to protect myself. A lot of people rely on me to be healthy and to be there for them. If I get sick or worse, I‚Äôve let them down. I want this all to end but it won‚Äôt by turning back; we have to go through it and come out stronger.
1/1	I got the moderna shot about 10 days ago and have been doing fine since thankfully!
1/1	I got the moderna vaccine and feel fine. I hope people continue to get vaccinated
1/1	I got the moderna vaccine and i have pre existing medical conditions i remember i had to wait in line for 2 hours to get vaccinated. Once I got in I tried to explain to this lady about my hormonal disorder. She didn't understand, so then i said that I also have asthma and then she said well why didn't you just say that!! So then I went to another station and they told me that I would be getting the moderna vaccine. Then after I got the vaccine they had everyone wait outside for 15 minutes in case of an allergic reaction. I went home and started feeling weird I got aches and pain a over I got a headache. Next day woke up with a headache and sweating a lot. After just pain in my arm and swelling because I have a crapy immune system. If you have a good immune system you'll be fine. My mother got it the same day as me and she felt nothing
1/1	I got the pfizer vaccine 8 days ago. Im feeling abit down but nothing else tho.
1/1	I got the pfizer!
1/1	I got the second dose two days ago. Yesterday, had to call off from work because I was so extremely tired and had a bad headache, spent most of the day sleeping. Today, woke up fresh as a daisy. Isn't that better than two weeks in isolation with Covid, or possibly having to go to the hospital?
1/1	I got the second shot of the vaccine yesterday. Surprisingly, I feel as good as, if not better than normal. Totally not what I was expecting. #allvaxxedup #strongerthanall
1/1/1/1	I got the vaccine
1/0	I got the vaccine I had a mild headache sore injection sight (mild) like someone punching you in the arm during the game "slug bug" lol I got a back ache (mild to medium depending on your pain tolerance) my girlfriend got the same symptoms we are smokers idk if that causes anything different... I feel so much safer now tho I recommend it all the residents at my group home were vaccinated today as well it was 2 weeks to late though a cook who didn't wear her mask properly every ( with chronic allergies was infected and spread it to 19/20 residents 70 and up.... 4 of which passed away in one week from covid at its worst 15 of the 20 residents went to the hospital for 2+ days or so defending. I say all this because if your scared of the vaccine do it for someone you care about and not for yourself because covid and mask if no big deal UNTIL one person doesn't follow the protocols and now u have a a wildfire spread throughout your work or family home. I was scared at to get vaccinated but I had to be the first at my job to show othersThat its safe.
0/-1	I got the vaccine after I heard of the Delta variant and how bad it was. That was my choice. But I support all the people who don't want it. And it really makes me mad they are trying to force something like this on people.
1/1	I got the vaccine and I am not afraid! I am doing it also for my child
0/0	I got the vaccine and I didn‚Äôt want it. I didn‚Äôt want it because despite what people say it IS EXPERIMENTAL. IT ISN‚ÄôT ESTABLISHED. IT IS NOT FDA APPROVED. PEOPLE DO NOT OWE ANYONE A BLOOD CLOT. NO ONE OWES ANY ONE HEART SWELLING. No one deserves to have their privacy intruded upon.
0/1/1	I got the vaccine and felt tired for a few days. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s been a week and I feel fine.
1/1	I got the vaccine and nothing happened to me.

1/1	I got the vaccine as a front line worker. I'm fine now.
1/0	I got the vaccine as a front line worker. Initially it didn't hurt but the 2nd day to 4th day my arm was sore but nothing intolerable. However I did suffer from extreme fatigue and irritability the 2nd and 3rd day
1/1	I got the vaccine as a team effort for the world.
1/1	I got the vaccine because I couldn‚Äôt carelessly cause someone harm. Whether it was a friend, family, or someone I disagree with or even dislike. Getting vaccinated shows a cohesion as Canadians to do the right thing.
0/0	I got the vaccine because I didn't want to lose my job and now I have heart problem( myocarditis and pericarditis) after the first dose with Pfizer- I lost my job and for the next 3-6 months no job. Government is playing with people's life.
1/1	I got the vaccine because I don‚Äôt want to die from covid-19. Even if I catch it but don‚Äôt die from it
1/1	I got the vaccine because I'm not a fucking retard that thinks pandemics can't happen in my lifetime and that those things are for history books.
1/1	I got the vaccine because I‚Äôve multiple co-morbidities that will make Covid 19 a death sentence.
1/1	I got the vaccine but I don't believe they should force people to get it.
0	I got the vaccine card and QR code for I and my family with some friends without been vaccinated. We need Freedom

1/1	I got the vaccine myself on the 5th of January and I feel great
1/1	I got the vaccine there's nothing wrong with it
1/1	I got the vaccine to protect the people around me and you should too.
1/1	I got the vaccine today and didn‚Äôt look at it. Now that I‚Äôm watching this video I can‚Äôt believe how long the needle is LOL. Good thing I didn‚Äôt look at the needle when I got my vaccine. I would‚Äôve freaked out. It honestly felt like a small pinch, no pain at all and super fast!
1/1	I got the vaccine too and shared my journey, on my yt just now!!
1/1	I got the vaccine two days ago... I'm fine. I felt like I was getting a cold for about an hour. It takes me longer to recover from a Flu shot. My arm hurt for about 24 hours. That's it....
1/1	I got the vaccine without any symptoms whatsoever. Not even discomfort at the injection site
0/-1	I got the vaccine yesterday and not even 6 hours later I was getting all of those side effects, chills, cold sweats, vomiting, migraine, fever, muscle aches it‚Äôs been absolutely terrible especially at night because I kept puking, this morning I feel more better but I still have the migraine and my muscles are still aching
0/0	I got the vaccine yesterday n it kicked me in the butt. Be Careful !
1/1	I got the vaccine, I'm protected. People have lost their damn minds.
1/1	I got the vaccine, and hope all who did , are ok. I also take garlic ,anticoagulant.
1/1	I got the vaccine, both doses, as soon as I possibly could. Why? My dad died four years ago at the age of 83. I got it because I want to live as long as possible (a selfish notion, I know).
1/1	I got the vaccine, but I understand why people are like "why should we get a rushed vaccine. And covid has a really high survival rate anyways". Even though it was made pretty quick, it has been thoroughly tested and its safe. The covid 19 vaccine also prevents yo from spreading it. But it is your body so your choice.
1/1	I got the vaccine, moderna one, and I was just very sleepy lol
1/1	I got the vaccine, moderna one, and I was just very sleepy lol. And that's common for every vaccine.
1/1/1/1/1/1	I got the vaccine, still alive and haven't grown a tail
1/1	I got the vaccine. It works great.
1/1	I got the vaccine... no issues lol
1/1	I got the vaccines, because I was so afraid of getting and passing the virus on to someone older or weaker than me. I would feel so bad if someone else died because of my carelessness. I did whatever it took. And so did my husband and all my children. And we were still taking other precautions.
0/0	I got thru 2020 without getting covid so ill be fine without the dumb vaccine
1/1	I got to get out of this place.. Ugg can't live another year with this hate. Has anyone else lost friends because you and your family got vaccinated? I just don't know how to keep living around people so stupid.
1/1	I got two already I trust them
1/1	I got vaccinated 6 months ago with Moderna, had shoulder pain for a day after 2nd dose and that was it.
1/1/1	I got vaccinated a few days ago, didn‚Äôt pay a dime. They told me when to come and I was in and out within 20 minutes, 15 of those minutes spent waiting to make sure no allergic reaction or weakness occurs. The shot didn‚Äôt even hurt, and I‚Äôm someone who is horrible with getting shots. Worst symptom was my arm hurt for a day or two.
1/1	I got vaccinated against corona virus
1/1	I got vaccinated against covid-19 today and I will get the second vaccine in the beginning of June. I already feel a little bit more safe
1/1	I got vaccinated and boosted and I wear a mask because I want fewer people to get sick and die. It's pretty simple. If those things are too much of a personal sacrifice for you and if 850,000 funerals don't move you enough to care about people, that's on you.
0/-1	I got vaccinated and it cured my life. Now I'm dead and I couldn't be happier!
1/1	I got vaccinated as soon as I could to protect myself and my wife and friends. She did for the same reason. My friends and their families did likewise.
1/1	I got vaccinated because no one likes wearing a mask. No one likes social distancing. No one likes restaurants being closed for dine in service. No one likes being away from loved ones. No one likes covid. The more I can do now the sooner this can be reduced as much as possible!
1/1	I got vaccinated for corona. Got the first dose of #Covishield at Tathagat hospital at Crecent road, Bengaluru
1/1	I got vaccinated for my loved ones

1/1	I got vaccinated to keep every Albertan, every Canadian safe.
1/1	I got vaccinated to protect my family & because it aligns with my values to contribute to society in a positive & collaborative way, protect our weakest & because its the only way this becomes an endemic. It takes a village of empathetic citizens.

1/1	I got vaccinated! I only had a sore arm for a day or two. No issues otherwise!!
1/1	I got vaccinated. Nothing happened. Did not get magnetic, still only surveyed by Google and Facebook, no less freedom. Just no covid. More freedom. That was the point. Mission accomplished. Thank you, science and healthcare workers.
1/1	I got vaccination a day before yesterday and got fever body pain and coughing. Dr prescribed me only paracetamol 2 time a day. Now I feel very better. Stay blessed Go get your vaccine today.

1/1	I got vaxxed to protect myself.
0/0	I graduated the D.A.R.E program in 1986. I wont bow to peer pressure. Just Say No
0/0	I guarantee you..... the people who drop dead shortly After taking the Vaccines.... Would Still be Alive & Well if they did NOT take them .
0/0	I guess 4 year olds can‚Äôt riot..This is disgusting to have them vacinated
1/1	I guess I‚Äôll be the only one in the comments to say I‚Äôm looking forward to getting my vaccine as soon as we have good evidence of safety from late stage trials.
1/0	I guess a study of 11 million people isn't good enough... which is a typical response from a zealot anti-vaxxer. Facts don't matter.
0/-1	I guess it's called herd immunity when you're considered cattle. üêÆüêÆüêÆüêÆ
1/-1/-1	I guess there some vaccines that could increase people's intelligence
0/0	I had 2 Pfizer Vaccines and I can feel the heart beat difference when I am running or biking. I can‚Äôt running or biking like before. My heart is like 10 years older than before after I took the vaccine shots.
1/1	I had 2 doses of Pfizer, other than arm pain, I had NO side effects
1/1	I had 2 doses of Pfizer, other than arm pain, I had NO side effects.
1/1	I had AstraZeneca's vaccine in a trial. The side effects weren't fun after the initial dose. I felt like I had the flu for 2 days. No side effects after the second dose. That said, the side effects were a small price to pay for covid immunity.
0/0	I had COVID and haven't gotten a "vaccine". Why would I want to get a vaccine that doesn't work and hasn't had years of research when having COVID in my experience wasn't that bad (in fact lots of other common illnesses I've had were far worse than 'Rona)
1/1	I had COVID took the vaccine. I feel great!
1/1	I had COVID, and after a stay in the hospital I am 41 and on oxygen until my lungs heal...when and if I can get it..I will!!!! I absolutely do not want this again!!!!
0/0/0/0	I had COVID-19 last month. The side effects for the vaccine sound like they are worse than what I had with the actual virus.
1/0	I had COVID. It is not the flu. The vaccines protected me or I would have ended up in hospital.
1/1	I had Covid at the beginning of the year. I had my first Pfizer shot Tuesday. I can tell you now that you'd rather have the jab a thousand times over than the real thing!
1/1	I had Covid in December, and had the vaccine in January only side effect I had was my arm was achy from the jab.
1/1	I had Covid in January and it's no joke, I still have chest pain three month later... chest pains! Don't listen to the bots, get vaccinated
1/1	I had Covid in November 2020 and I received my first Pfizer dose almost a week ago. I felt fatigue, whole body muscle aches, and my arm felt like someone hit it with a baseball bat. I‚Äôd rather deal with those symptoms then Covid any day.
0/0	I had Covid in beginning. 5 days only. Then i got delta variant 2 months ago. Was sick for 2 weeks... I never sweated so much in my life until my amazing immune system fought like hell to combat a synthetic modified man made virus.. I drink, smoke, and I am overweight. I also don't live on pharmaceutical meds. I recovered...
1/1	I had Covid in early December. Today, April 5th, I got my first Psizer vaccine.
1/1/1	I had Covid. Nothing is worse than that. Take the vaccine.
0/1	I had Delta in 2020. Double vaccination of moderna from then . Than got omicron in 2021. I stuck with skin problems for all the two years. Still have skin problems. I believe is my immune system over acted
1/1	I had Johnson one and booster no side effect feel great
0/0	I had a bad reaction to my first Moderna vaccine . Doctors were not only unhelpful but could care less. I went through 6 weeks of physical therapy due to intense dizzy spells. Then said I should go ahead and get the second shot . No thanks.
0/0	I had a bad reaction to the only flu shot that I got. Even though I am in and out of hospitals all day, I‚Äôm waiting to get vaccinated until more information comes out about it.
0/0	I had a bad reaction to the swine flu vaccine four years ago. We were told it was safe so i wont be taking this vaccine.
0/0	I had a bad reaction to the vaccine that I m only just now getting over. I had to get antibiotics. Every other week it seems like a type of the vaccine is coming out with new deadly reactions. This vaccine happened too fast and we do not have enough data to say that it is safe to make it a requirement for things just yet.
0/0	I had a blood clot and that's why I won't ever have another one .. And none of us can be sure it stops people dying .I know of people having had 3 jabs who have been very ill as the Jab has brought on illness and they have died
1/1	I had a dream last night that I was getting my vaccine. Too bad it was only a dream. I have to wait a lot because I am 34 . So I don‚Äôt know when I will get it .
1/1	I had a fever and fatigue with both doses :/ I was not expecting that for BOTH doses for a whole day. I felt pretty bummy not gonna lie lol. But I'm glad I did it just so I can be part of the herd immunity community so we can go back to normal as fast as possible.
1/-1	I had a few friends waiting for this - and now they are getting the Pfizer vaccine! Honestly, found many of those who were unsure were opting for the J&J, but you don‚Äôt hear a lot about that vaccine anymore. I know Pfizer is all about marketing, but it seems odd
0/0	I had a flu shot years ago and I have a permanent side effect. So, unless they are 100 percent sure, no vaccine till then!
0/0/0/0/0	I had a flu shot years ago and I have a permanent side effect. Tendentious in my right ankle. But never again for me.
0/-1	I had a high fever from jab definitely not placebo
0/0	I had a man come to my house yeterday to do some work, and was chatting away, then he said, " will you be having the jab?", i said no, how can you know whats in that then, he just said " well, we dont really know, do we, but yes , i'll be having it", nice bloke, and probobly in his thirties, he told me he was married and had three children, but he has accepted the narrative without question, i said he really ought to do some research into what is going into these vaccines, " oh well," he said and then moved off into another room, and i fear that is the sort of attitude of many, what a great shame.
1/1	I had a nasty experience of covid last year my self and went to get my covid vaccine and yes had a little breakdown emotionally as I stood and said thank you to the lord for showing some light and thank you to all the staff that was actually vaccinating us all one by one
1/1	I had a pretty miserable reaction to both shots - the second was definitely worse. I had fever, chills, fatigue, headache, stomach and abdominal cramping, and barely slept that night. Got the shot on a Friday, and by Sunday I was back to normal. I'd do it again even knowing how miserable it made me feel, because now I'm back to life as it was pre-covid.
0/-1	I had a professor in med school who said ‚Äú Don‚Äôt ever be the first or the last to try a medication‚Äù. I‚Äôm planning on doing exactly that.
1/1	I had a relative die from covid recently. They weren't vaccinated. I wish they were.
0/0	I had a stroke at 40, I‚Äôm 44 now and there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm getting vaccinated. I don‚Äôt need anymore health problems. The government has gone too far with the mandates.
0	I had a very bad experience with just the flu shot . Theres no way they're putting this experimental crap in me .
0/0	I had already decided not to take the vaccine long ago. I don't trust the government or the pharms. I trust God. Thank you for the article.
1/1	I had an adverse reaction as a kid and my parents were advised to not continue my vaccination plan. I had 2/3 sets of vaccinations. My reaction was honestly very minor. I had a full body rash that lasted a couple weeks. The doctors were worried about more severe allergic reactions though. That being said, I've realized as an adult that I wish they would have finished them. I have literally met people who had several family members get polio from not being vaccinated. One of the three people in their family died who got it. Yet their entire family is still stingintly anti-vaxx. I literally have to keep my self from screaming what are you doing at them? I'm not a medical professional but have a science background and the amount of disinformation boggles my mind. Did no one ever teach you to vet sources at any point in your life? Apparently not, which is a complete failure of our school system.
0/-1	I had an appointment this morning. They called and cancelled my appointment citing the FDA and CDC recommended halting the vaccine.
1/1	I had astra zeneca, I‚Äôm mid 60‚Äôs and nothing happened, so perhaps people shouldn‚Äôt generalize
1/1	I had been fully vaccinated since September and will be getting my booster on Sunday and no I‚Äôm not dead or magnetic or whatever people will eat up on from social media. The vaccine is safe
1/1	I had both Moderna shots. Only had a sore arm. No regrets.
1/1	I had both of my vaccines and didn't have any side effects, only with the first dose my arm was very little sore the day of, that's it! No sore arm with the second one, no side effects, my boyfriend the same as me. Yay!
1/1	I had both of the Pfizer doses and no side effects besides a sore arm where I received the injection. So grateful for science!
1/1/1/1	I had both shots ..nada zip zero side effects..well..probably nothing but is it normal to eat raw carrots a lot more now?
1/1	I had both shots already both felt exactly the same to me they were both no big deal no fever no chills, nothing. Aside from a little arm soreness. But it is based on your immune system. If you are the type of person who gets a Cold or sick from people who are sick just by being around them then you are going to have a much worse flu like symptoms to each shot More so the second one. My body is a modern marvel in that it is extremely rare that I can get sick I can sleep and live with people who are sick and I will not show even the slightest sign of it so I wasn't surprised by not having any negative side effects. My body is it's own walking bubble. Perhaps from already having gseveral diseases that My body is like a stone fortress (Graves, moyamoya, gerd.). Hence why I got early access to the vaccine because of "vulnerability".
1/1	I had both shots and only had very mild fatigue and slightly swollen lymph nodes. Nothing that slowed me down though. Much better than all the patient's I've had who were sick with covid.
1/1	I had chills and fever, aching from head to toe, extreme tiredness and headache, as well as dead arm, generally feeling Absolutely crap. Side effects lasted for 48 hours, so far. Absolutely worth it , better than covid complications any day.
1/1/1/1	I had covid 19 and beat it......and still got the shot just in case. I don't wish this for anyone. Until you have it and realize what it does to you, You really appreciate the little things in life.
0/0	I had covid and I had the vaccine. The vaccine was far worse.
1/1	I had covid and got my first dose of the vaccine yesterday. I got sick for 24 hours but am fine. This is just anti-science stupidity.
1/-1	I had covid and it almost killed me. All kinds of crazy and unpleasant symptoms. I still to this day, cannot fully smell. Mofos keep saying, "oh don't worry you'll get your sense of smell back." Meanwhile, 8 months later I'm still waiting for it to come back. What the heck is up with that?
0/0	I had covid and was fine after, I had 1 dose of Pfizer and am still having adverse reactions 3 months + later
0/0	I had covid even before it was an epidemic, then l had the vaccine and now the booster , and my heart doesn‚Äôt feel the same , the air capacity in my lungs has dropped dramatically the pains l get round my heart and in both arms when walking is so bad üíîüò≠
1/1	I had covid in 2020 once. It was like cold I lost my taste but it returned after like a week. I've been healthy throughout my entire life. I'm not vaccinated however I was thinking of getting vaccinated soon as I want to travel.
1/1	I had covid in November. I got the 1st Moderna, sore arm and joints with lots of fatigue. I'm having the 2nd next week.
0/1/0/0/0	I had covid last April... My body took care of it... Naturally vaccinated
0/-1	I had covid with no symptoms at all. My only proof being i looked after my husband for three weeks having covid. My feeling is that I had natural immunity . I never get colds or flhi. This leads me to believe that natural immunity to covid can last years and years.
0/0	I had covid- 19 three months ago so I have the antibodies so why do i need more antibodies from a jab? it doesn't make sense as I've allready been vaccinated naturally.
0	I had covid19 a year ago but my body overcame it and I refused to get vaccinated

1/1	I had h1n1 aka swine flu and pneumonia in 2014 I got vaccinated after my age group was able to, I lost my uncle earlier this year to COVID-19 and I am saying get vaccinated, don't just do it for you, do it for your kids and your family

1/1	I had my 1st Astra Zeneca jab a couple of weeks ago. I felt really tired and had a heavy / foggy head for about 48 hours- I can only liken it to a hangover or jet lag. But the alternative is much worse isn‚Äôt it? I am so happy and relieved I had it.
0/0	I had my 1st shot yesterday and the side effects are killing me rn. I have a fever, headache, tiredness, muscle pain, chills. What‚Äôs worse is I have a scapula fracture on my right and i had the vaccine on my left.
1/1	I had my Pfizer vaccine and did not feel any side effects. I believe it works well with me
1/1	I had my Pfizer vaccine and did not feel any side effects. I believe it works well with me ‚Äòalhamdullilah‚Äô
1/1	I had my Pfizer vaccine shot. I just hope for the best
1/1	I had my Pfizer vaccine yesterday and I am 20 years old! I have chronic lung disease, asthma and I was born 13 weeks premature. The only side effect I've had is gratefulness <3 Keep safe everyone!
1/1	I had my booster a few days ago!!! I feel great!! A layer of protection for myself and others. I encourage everyone to get vaccinated when it's their turn.
1/1	I had my booster last year in October. I caught the virus last week and had diarrhea, a scratchy throat in the mornings, and a racing heartbeat the previous weekend. No fever. My close family members tested positive, so I assume I also had it. This past Tuesday, I felt normal again and feel great now. Of course, I caught the initial stain back in 2020, but please get the booster, and when you get exposed, you‚Äôll probably not feel a thing.
1/1/1	I had my covid 'jab' last Sunday morning at Ysbyty Efnys, Rainbow Hospital, Llandudno. I cannot praise highly enough the staff, volunteers, two RAF blokes on gate and the man in the parking lot for the work they were doing. So well organised, no waiting outside in the cold, all of them helpful,smiling and jolly. It was a very pleasant experience.
1	I had my first Moderna shot, they are doing people over 65 along with frontline workers nursing home residents
1/1	I had my first Oxford AstraZeneca shot over 3wks ago and I'm 52 & no complications - due in June for the second. It seems to me like they should be aspirating, just to be on the safe side, seems silly not to. Thanks for the update, you've made sense of all that, it's much clearer than I could sifting through all that data!
1/1	I had my first Pfizer last Thursday. Looking forward to my second one.
1/1	I had my first almost 4 weeks ago and I'm looking forward to my second.
1/1/1/1	I had my first covid vaccine today, one more to go
1/1	I had my first dose of Moderna vaccine Jan. 11th; I felt good the next day, only a slight soreness on the arm. On Jan. 26th I received my 2nd dose of Moderna and as the evening progressed I felt unwell, no fever just whole body fatigue. By the morning I fully recovered and only had extra soreness on the arm. Otherwise I currently feel great!
1/1	I had my first dose of a vaccine (Oxford) today and I am grateful
1/1	I had my first dose of vaccine .. Looking for 2nd dose
1/1	I had my first jab of SinoVac and it's all great, nothing to worry. However, those who don't want to get vaccinated, natural immune booster should be Vit C with zinc, Vit D(sunshine) and healthy lifestyle. Be safe and healthy y'all!
0/0	I had my first short of Pfizer two weeks ago and had really bad side effects chills, excessive sweating , tingle on my lips and left side of my body , brain zaps and elevated Bp ‚Ä¶ ended up in emergency twice ‚Ä¶all my blood test and CT scans are clear going for an MRI I googled and found that there are a lot of people having similar symptoms but feel like doctors are scared to link these symptoms with Pfizer vaccination
1/1	I had my first shot a few days ago. The only side effect I had was a mild headache and a slight tender arm. Only lasted a few hours.
1/1	I had my first shot of Modena 2 weeks ago and had a possible side effect of drowsiness 2 days after the shot. Otherwise, for an 88 year-old I seem to doing okay.
1/1	I had my first shot recently. I got sore arms the next day which lasted about half day and I was back to normal. Yet to take my second dose.
1/1	I had my first vaccine injection on Friday at River Lodge surgery. I would like to thank you for the speed of the date given, the very efficient way it was carried out and the friendly and courteous way that I was treated by all the staff, it was most appreciated
1/1	I had my jab today, I was a bit scared but I‚Äôm even more scared to think what COVID-19 could do to me.
1/1	I had my moderna two doses and I'm so glad I did. My county recently had a bigger outbreak of covid (6 times the cases) and I feel so much better knowing that I'm protected and so is my family. In fact it's helped my mental health alot. I spent over a year very scared of my family getting sick so I avoided any contact with people outside my family and that led me into a form of depression. Being able to go out (with mask and distance) and feel safe has been a game changer. Oh and for anyone curious heres my side effects, 1st shot: sore arm lasted 2 days. 2nd shot: muscle ache, headache, lasted 1.5 days
0/0	I had my second AstraZeneca vaccination over three weeks ago and I haven‚Äôt been right since. I just feel weak and want to sleep all the time. I won‚Äôt be having a booster.
1/1	I had my second dose yesterday. I was in and out within 10 minuets. I feel like pure garbage today but I‚Äôm so happy to be vaccinated!
1/1	I had my second shot 3 days ago and so far no side effects except for a sore arm!
1/1	I had my second shot of pfizer 3 weeks ago. I feel amazing.
1/1	I had my second shot of pfizer 3 weeks ago. I felt rough for about a week, I have also seen the horror stories surrounding these vaccines. Thank you so much for this video brilliantly explained and reassuring.
1/1	I had my second vaccine yesterday! Had a sore arm and feeling a bit tired today but feeling completely fine other than that
1/-1	I had my suspicions that many adults weren't smart, but I had no idea the situation was this dire.
1/1	I had my third dose in August. I‚Äôll take a fourth one as soon as it is offered here in the US.
1/1	I had my vaccine a few days ago now and I had a slight headache after and a very sore arm , but within a day back to normal ... just have the bloody vaccine and life can start to rebuild
1/0	I had my vaccine a week ago and now I am feeling morning sickness and nausea.
1/1	I had my vaccine last Thursday! I had a really sore arm on Friday easing on Saturday not even a twinge on Sunday. Rather that than lying at deaths door with Covid 19. Have your vaccination PLEASE!
1/1	I had my vaccine on Monday. I'm so grateful to get it. I've had some side effects but main one is the extreme tiredness.
1/1	I had my vax yesterday and have aall the side effects but getting over it now.
1/1	I had no side effects with Pfize
1/1	I had no symptoms after first one. Got second one yesterday. So far so good.
0/0	I had offered to me but I think I'm going to bide my time. I don't know if I want to risk the possible side effects.
1/1	I had one dose of Pfizer so far. Good to see actual explanation of what the vaccine does.
1	I had seizures for years due to the DPT shot as a kid. So I was hesitant when my daughter was born thankfully we have a great family doctor who acknowledged that the old DPT vaccines were not great but then explained to me how they changed since I was a kid. Also he was willing to work with me so my daughter only got one vaccine at a time (not multiple like most vaccine schedules) this made me much more comfortable so I didn‚Äôt feel like her body was getting overwhelmed and gave me insurance that if there was a reaction I would know to what and we would not do the boosters to it. Thankfully she has had no reaction to any of them. I could have easily been turned into an anti vaxer if I would have not had a great doctor to sit talk with me and work it out so I was comfortable with the process.....Great Doctors Save Lives.
1/1/1/1	I had side effects, from nausea to fever to aches. The nights were the worst. On the 4th day I slept it off. I never worried knowing my body was doing its job. I missed a day of work. I hope my 2nd shot is smoother, but if it's not, I'm still celebrating.
1/1	I had side-effects. The usual side-effects you get when the antigens in a vaccine have stimulated the body's defence mechanisms. Tired, a bit under the weather for a few hours, very mild headache, etc. Nothing to worry about; in fact the reverse; they are a sign that my body's immune response will be producing antibodies which will be lying in wait for any Covid-19 viruses which dare to try and invade. Side-effects are welcome, as was the vaccine.
1/1	I had some covid vaccine side effects that were very mild. They improved with Tylenol. I don't regret getting the vaccine, since now I am immune to COVID!
0/0	I had terrible side effects, After a couple of days I had horrible Tiredness , Malaise, Terrible Itching of the my skin All over I had to call the Emergencency Very high Blood pressure. , I had an MRI Thank god No sign of a stroke, However I will never get a shot In any vaccine Specially ASTRAZENECA For my SKIN ITCH THEY PRESCRIBED A MEDICATION , However I'm still taking it for my Itchy skin Which I think Is the RE-_ACTION for me I'm 77 yrs old, Not for the elderly PLEASE TAKE A WARNING For if you have Immune deficiency.Problems with you health, Be very careful, and ask your doctor before Undergo an Unnecessary Pain & suffering I also had covid, So I didn't want to take the Shot, Because I thought I was in a{ former Health care profession} Your Immune System Should Be able to take over So You no longer need the the Covid injection Unfortunately The Government and THE WHO organization pushing the vaccine !!
1/1/1	I had the J & J. Slept for 11 hours. That was great. I never get enough sleep...lol A little tender at injection site. That's it. Feel great
1/1	I had the Johnson and Johnson April 6th and had every reaction from 7:00PM the evening of shot to early morning, then took Tylenol with small breakfast, slept, woke up 2 to 3 hours later and fine ever since. Relaxed and saw a couple movies on Epix and drank a lot of water and took Vitamins and walked a little, made Keto dinner. Ready now for vacation, gardening in May and getting in more walks and getting my malt that I promised myself for job well done. Oh, remembered what my Mom told me: "It has to get worse before it gets better and she was right.
1/1	I had the Oxford vaccine, my arm ached for about 2 days and then for about a week after it hurt around the injection site. I carried on working as usual and didn't care much for the side effects as it means that I'm one step closer to being able to hug my grandad, which I haven't been able to do in over a year
1/1	I had the Pfizer Vaccine, and I had a slight headache, runny nose, and felt tired, for about 3 days. But after that I felt fine, hey, it's better than dying!
1/1	I had the Pfizer biotech jab, wonderful protection with no side effects.
1/0	I had the Pfizer vaccine last monday and i still feel terrible
1/1	I had the Pfizer vaccine, apart from an achy arm, I was fine ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëç get vaccinated folks, when it is offered to you, take it!
1/1	I had the Pfizer's Vaccine shot in April. Got the chills 12 hours after my first shot. Gave me hay fever for a day. Weeks later after the first dose, my second shot was good. I never had the COVID-19, but I think it's better to have hay fever from the vaccine than being vulnerable to the virus.
1/1	I had the chinese vaccine
0/0	I had the covid , no problem , two weeks of flu symptoms and then ok , would I take a vaccine for the covid ? No chance ,.
0/1	I had the covid vaccine yesterday and it‚Äôs knocked me out. Been in bed all day and had to call in sick at work. Think I‚Äôve had every side effect since last night
0/1	I had the first dose of the vaccine on Friday & I am fine besides a sore arm were the injection site is like the flu jab
0/1	I had the first of the Phizer covid vaccine and have suffered no ill effects. Age 69
1/1	I had the first ‚Äî and lived. I can hardly wait for the 2nd in 2 weeks.
1/1	I had the flu and pneumonia shots a couple weeks ago. 3 degree fever and major body aches for about 2 days. I've never reacted that hard before to a flu shot before. I would rather be on my ass for 2-3 days with the vaccine than two plus weeks and the possibility of needing a vent.
0/0	I had the flu vax 3 times in my life. All 3 times I got seriously ill. I'll pass on this sh!t thank you
1/1	I had the fourth Covid vaccine in January, and would have a fifth too if needed.
1/1	I had the jab yesterday. See you on the other side üòÅ
1/1	I had the jhonson and Jhonson one time shot and feel better than i have in many years
1/1	I had the pfizer vaccination today. Feel so lucky to be given one, wasn't expecting to have it this early
0/-1	I had the same reaction to last years flu vaccine. Something triggered my central nervous system so i had tingling in my legs, arms and head. Nope. Never again.
1/1	I had the shingles vaccine. Felt like I‚Äôd been hit by a truck for a few days (achy...I have RA. Maybe that‚Äôs why?). Better than getting shingle though!!
0/1	I had the two that was required, Thats me done, Everyone I know that had the booster caught covid, So thats a big no from me. Live with it. Wash your hands. Thats it.
1/1	I had the vaccine 2 weeks ago with zero side effects. Zero
0/0	I had the vaccine 3 days ago, i started to have a really strong cough recently and also i vomited 2 times, also i could not play football as i used befoe cus i kinda feel weakness, tbh i should not have had it. Its almost one week and im not feeling okay
1/0	I had the vaccine 3 days ago, i started to have a really strong cough recently and also i vomited 2 times, also i could not play football as i used befoe cus i kinda feel weakness, tbh i should not have had it. Its almost one week and im not feeling okay, sorry for my bad english, god bless you and bless all your loved ones.
1/1	I had the vaccine and I am pro vaccine but I‚Äôm against forced vaccination. I believe everyone has the fundamental right to decide what goes into their body.
1	I had the vaccine to save my life for been an elderly person my lungs might not be up to strength to fight off the covid 19.
1/1	I had the vaccine when I was pregnant and I was terrified. It I don‚Äôt regret it for a moment. All the risks with the vaccine are super rare. They will probably just have a day where they feel off but much better than what the virus could do
1/1	I had the vaccine yesterday... IM ALIVE ü•≥
1/1	I had this shot and had no issue
1/1	I had this vaccine and I'm just recovering from being what if feels like, being hit by a bus! I told my wife and baby boy, I loved them so much...thinking the worse! But if it gives me a chance to see my boy grow have a future, it was worth the pain!
1/1	I had this vaccine in the trials. Side effects were minor.
1/1	I had three full doses (the third one only five months after the second) and I‚Äôm so glad I did! The booster gives the extra protection needed.
0/0	I had to care for a patient who died from taking this vaccine, and now they are trying to force us to take it, we worked for over a year with no adequate ppe which we still do not have, and no compensation...please protect us.
1	I had to have this vaccine as I am allergic to penicillin do cannot have the Pfizer. Any vaccine is better than none. Maybe by the time I have my top up it will be improved but whatever I'd had I will continue to observe the basic guidelines for a long time yet.
1/1	I had to turn away my dentist because he and most of his staff are not vaccinated. I get it‚Äôs not exactly the same but ugh.
1/1	I had two doses . Little effects in a few days. Sore arm. I am alive !!! Vaccine is safe !
1/1	I had zero side effects
1/1	I hardly can't wait to get vaccinated! Well done
1/-1	I hate anti vaccers with my whole heart
1/1	I hate anti vaxxers
1/1	I hate needles more than anything in the entire world (including bees), and I pass out every time I‚Äôm near one. That said, I will be getting the vaccine as soon as it‚Äôs available to me.
0/0	I hate science and vaccine
0/0	I hate that I was forced to do the vaccine and threatened to be fired from work. We don‚Äôt even have a say on our own health, forget about this thing is good or bad, your forced to do it, I got the vaccine this morning and now I feel sick also breastfeeding so worried I am. I was already naturally immune and my Covid experience was just like the normal viral sickness we usually get- I pray to God as I and all of us are in his hands, and I leave myself In God‚Äôs hands but those who made it mandatory will pay for this in the day of judgment
1/1	I hate that we have come to a time when we shut up a Doctor and tell them they are wrong because we have "investigated"
1/1	I hate the SEC you can't just say you have the best vaccine ever but thanks for the tips. Please end this pandemic! :)
0/0	I hate to be an anti vax Karen but i don‚Äôt trust Pfizer
0/0	I hate to say it but this is starting to look like natural selection on a vast scale. Thousands of cars formed queues miles long and waited for hours to get vaccinated at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles. Hundreds of people tried to hand them leaflets with information about the "vaccine", it's ingredients and it's dangers. The sheep kept their car windows tightly closed. Just like little children sticking their fingers in their ears and yelling "Na-na-na-na". Those pamphlets could have saved their lives.
1/1/0	I hate to tell you this, but everyone being vaccinated will not make Americans normal.
1/1/1/1	I hate when people just say "research". What research? When I researched vaccines as a parent I looked at tons of peer reviewed studies and came to the conclusion that the benefits of vaccinating greatly outweighed any risks. I have trouble believing anyone could look at what I did with an open mind and come to any other conclusion. So what "research" are people who are anti-vaccine looking at? Anecdotal evidence is not good evidence!
0/0	I have 2 siblings that both have 2 kids ages 20 and 22. The unvaccinated 2 are brilliantly intelligent and very healthy. The 2 vaccinated have Autisim.
1/1	I have 3 more weeks to go. My dad has lung cancer so I'm currently staying with them... but he goes out to restaurants and crowded places while I try my hardest not to catch covid even more than before. Being at home also drives me fucking insane so I really need this vaccine and hopefully I can at least get the fuck out of the house.
0/0	I have 99.97 reasons why I‚Äôm not putting that shit into my body
0/-1	I have Blood Clots, since June 2021. I'm double jabbed. Also suffer from Sarcoidosis Pulmonary Fibrosis. The Blood Thinners are protecting me. Azra Zenica jabbed.
1/1	I have CHF, Type 2 Diabeties, Hashimotos. I had J&;J my first shot and Pfizer my second shot, ZERO ISSUES with the vaccine. Unvaxxed people I work with are getting covid and 1 person has died from covid, I haven't got covid, vaccines work.
1/1	I have Covid, glad I've had the vaccines because even with them this thing is not good.
1	I have Crohns and UC. I got the Maderna and I'm glad that I got the vaccine. I have lost family and friends who didn't vaccinated
0/0	I have God, i will not put that poison in my body
1/-1	I have Tinnitus since last August as a side effect from a prescribed medicine, I'm getting better and healing.. I'd definitely like to get vaccinated but the reactions from vaccine aggrevating T keeps bothering me and that is delaying my decision to take the jab. Thanks sandhya!
1/1	I have ZERO sympathy for the anti-masker / anti-vaxxer that die from COVID
1	I have a 20 something colleague who got Covid June last year. They were very fit - into martial arts and MMA. They now struggle to get upstairs without wheezing. They weren't hospitalised at the time. They felt a bit "ick" for few days (their own words "like I had a bad cold"), got "better" but some effects have still lingered. I got my second dose of (Pfizer) vaccine on Monday (30 something yo health professional). Yesterday (Tues) it was like I'd been hit by a wrecking ball - high temperature (over 38 degrees), aching everywhere, chills. Really not a fun 24 hours, and even today I still have a bit of a fever, a stiff neck, and a headache, but I'm functional. Would I trade that "feeling absolute rubbish for 48 hours but then being fine and protected" for "I'll take the chance I'll only get something mild, but it could disable me for months, if not permanently"? Not on your nelly.
0/0	I have a 99.5% chance of surviving without the vaccine
1/1/1/1	I have a Rammstein concert in September so y'all better get your vaccination.
0/0	I have a better chance of dying from the vaccine than from Covid. Risk assessment tells me I don‚Äôt need a vaccine. Logic tells me I survived a ‚Äúdeadly‚Äù pandemic without a vaccine so I don‚Äôt need it.
1/1	I have a cancer, the vaccine is the safest way for me to protect my self
0/0/0	I have a child with autism and I began to see a change im my son just hours after his MMR vaccine. This documentary holds absolute truth on this government/vaccine conspiracy
1/1	I have a compromised immune system. Hyperthyroidism, arthritis, tendonitis, and I am over weight. I got my first shot in Feb day after my b-day and my second one last month. Having an allergic reaction I do believe the CDC said it is less than 1%. To me vaccination is very important to myself and for my child. I have food allergies and a material allergy. So I had a small fear but onve I got it they monitor you for 15 minutes. Those who are monitoring are medical professionals.
0/0/0/0/0	I have a cousin and his wife, who do vaccine research, and collectively have 40 years experience in this field .They told me never to take a vaccine....I'll listen to them.
0/-1	I have a family member in hospital with nerve damage from the astrazeneca. I'm not going to tell people to have this jab or not but please look into it before you decide.
1/1	I have a fear of needles and have had many over the years . This was the easiest & by far. Done & dusted so quickly.
0/0/0	I have a friend who has a child that got autistic after a vaccine.
1/1/1	I have a friend whose continuing shortness of breath, almost a year post-COVID, improved immensely after the vaccine.
0/-1	I have a fully functioning immune system which I've had all my life and has never let me down. Thank you God.
1	I have a good feeling that over the next few months we'll start to see actually good rollout. Even things like the soft power of the presidency being able to give good guidance and best practices would be helpful. Like..."oh hey guys, north Dakota did really well with this practice for rural folks"
0/0	I have a healthy young body and i do not want random fast tested vaccine in my body
1/1	I have a history of anaphylaxis. I refilled my epipens, got the vaccine, and have been totally fine since, aside from a sore arm for a day or two
1/-1	I have a lot of friends who didn't want me to get that shot. All these reasons where brought up. I didn't have the best response. Now I do.
1/1	I have a lot of respect for you doc üòá I getting my second Moderna vaccine üíâ shot tomorrow üôèüèΩ
1/1	I have a lot of respect for you doc, I getting my second Moderna vaccine shot tomorrow
0/0	I have a question -if vaccines work then why are the vaccinated so threatened by those who don‚Äôt want it. They will be protected ... right? I smell a bigger agenda going on.
0/0	I have a question ?? after getting vaccinated ,after 2 years we will die or not
0/0	I have a question about why you think the human body has somehow become unable to utilize its own innate defense system to combat a respiratory virus and now requires external pharmaceutical chemicals in order to stay healthy.
0/-1	I have a question if I had COVID and got it a second time with milder symptoms that would mean I have immunity right ? The first time I really thought I was going to drown in my own lungs from mucus and I could not breathe eat or make it to the bathroom but I did manage as best as I could and I kept my finger on 911 (I was afraid to go to the hospital because if I had it I didn't want to give it - if not I didn't want it) I went to Ergentcare and stayed outside I got an inhaler and cough medicine w/cod. I have never had a cold or flu like that before .. it's no joke ! But I still have some immunity from this monster right ... ? My choice is to skip the shot .. !
0	I have a question, since 1933 when Influenza was discovered; in the US an average of 55,000 to 95,000/year die from Influenza. So roughly 6-8million have died and yet no vaccine that has ever worked? 89 yrs not 8.9 months like your vaccine. And you trust it?
0/0	I have a question. Why do so many of my vaccinated friends appear to have no natural immune system anymore ?
0/0	I have a serious question, why isn't there ANY talk of alternative treatments to Covid-19?
0/0	I have a simple question why can't they spend money on the Cure instead of the vaccine I already know the answer but I would like to know from you to answer me if is the same logical explanation of what i already know
0/0	I have a strong immune system that NEVER gets infected and never has to obtain an immune response. I have never gotten nor will I ever get COVID because I am healthy and strong. I will decline vaccination because I am not frail and unhealthy. Only frail people proselytize vaccines because they are very weak and very unhealthy and are on their way out; they need vaccines in order to survive.
0/0/0/0	I have a tent, i know where the woods are. Good luck making me put your toxins in me.
1/-1	I have all the basics and more, I travelled to Ethiopia a few years ago for work so had boosters
1/-1	I have all the vaccinations I'm supposed to have.
1/1	I have already been vaccinated so I encourage people to do the same like I myself
1/1	I have already gotten both shots. To anyone who is skeptical I ask what are you afraid of?
0/0	I have always been armed with th cure just incase my fam or i gets it. I dont need the jab at all.
1/1	I have always gotten a flu shot every year. I will continue to get one, so what the heck, I‚Äôll get a Covid booster, too.
1/1	I have always said I am not in a rush to get it but as it grows closer, I definitely look forward to getting it.
1/1	I have an active blood clot (developed before I got the AZ vaccine so not linked) - haemotologist advised me that most issues occurred in first 7 days after first jab. He‚Äôs happy for me to have second jab as I had no reaction to first bar mild flu like symptoms.
1/1	I have an appointment for it on 23 rd. And if they allow I‚Äôll get it
0/0	I have an autoimmune disease and will refuse to take it. I have immunity to COVID after having the Hong Kong flu in 1968. My young children were with me during the long 2 weeks my mom was there to help take care of them. I was exposed to COVID 6 times by family and a friend and did NOT get the virus My children, mom and I have never had any flu since 1968!
0/0	I have an autoimmune disorder (psoriasis) that has a high potential of becoming extremely bad if I receive the flu vaccine. And that is only a newly discovered adverse effect of THAT vaccine. I won't be rushing out for a Covid-19 vaccine because of the possibility of the same problem.
1/1/1	I have an elderly father in one country and an elderly mother-in-law in another, my wife and I have not seen them for a long time, so yeah, we will get vaccinated as soon as we can to be able to travel and visit them without infecting them.
0/0	I have an immune system that works pretty damn good. I will just eat right and skip all the experiments with the vaccine.
0/0	I have an immune system!! It works great!! Peace!!
1/1	I have autism and I HATE it when others say 'OoOo VaCcInEs CaUsE aUtIsM oOoO'
1/0	I have autism and I was not vaccinated as a kid. Because my mum was worried about it causing autism.
1/1	I have autism myself, and no. Vaccines do NOT give autism, autism is a disorder that some people get permanently upon birth.
0/-1	I have back pain
0/0	I have bad reactions to the Flu vaccine. I haven't taken the flu shot for years. I'm not going to risk the adverse reactions of the Covid19 vaccine.
0/0	I have been a Christian for 26 years. I still won't let anyone put anything in my body, that also means the chip of the BEAST, I WILL GO TO MY DEATH.
1/1	I have been dying to get vaccinated but starting his vaccination sequence at a lower dose with the hope the data will show a 3rd dose elicits a sufficient immune response
1/1	I have been fighting with mine since the beginning of the year. I thought I had them convinced, but then they would back out. They were concerned about potential side effects. Well, they both ended up getting Covid about a month ago and my dad spent a week in the hospital. Now they are both planning on getting their shots as soon as their doctor gives them the green light.
1/1	I have been fortunate enough to get the covid vaccine.
1/1	I have been fully vaccinated as i have a compromised immune system and COPD among other things
1/1	I have been getting flu shots for the past 40 years, so ‚Äòyes‚Äô I will consider getting a vaccine for COVID 19 when it becomes available.
0/0	I have been highly skeptical of the vaccine and Pfizer in particular. This interview hasn't changed my view at all.
1/1	I have been jabbed with Astra Zeneca no problems with side effects so far.
1/1	I have been offered an appointment for a COVID vaccine tomorrow. Which obviously will mean I will lie awake tonight panicking that it won't happen and feeling bad that I'm getting it when others haven't yet
0/-1	I have been offered an appointment for the vaccine, but I feel it is too early for me to evaluate the safety. I know we are in the middle of the deep blue sea with this.. as they maybe a rick not to take. However, my of is about feeling me up to do a job that I am not dependent on and only a few hours a month! A dilemma
1/0	I have been offered the vaccine, but I don't want to take it at this time. This is new technology never before tested on humans. What can possibly go wrong? I am not an anti-vaccer either. I have taken plenty of vaccinations (except for the flu vaccine), as I love to travel to really remote areas. What do you think of Ivermectin? Thank you.
1/1	I have been on the fence...worried about long term effects. I scheduled my vaccine after watching this video...Thank you for explaining everything so well.
1/1	I have been pro vax my entire life and I have only had the flu once and that was when I was a 6 year old who didnt care about getting sick after that I got more serious I nearly never got sick and when I did it was just some cold that lasted a day and all I had to do was to just not touch stuff and if you want to say "well you cant say anti vax dosent work since you have always been vaccinated" I knew a person that was not vaccinated because his parents wouldn't let them get vaccinated (we were 14) and they got the flu every 2 months and had to miss about 3 days of school everytime sometimes they would get it twice in a months during flu season so obviously anti vax doesn't work TLDR; I'm pro vax and I've only gotten the flu once while an old friend has gotten it many times
0/0	I have been safe since covid and I'll remain safe without any vaccine in Jesus name.
0/0	I have been screaming it to everyone. The COVID vaccine is going kill people. Everything about it is hinky! How can a vaccine be produced so quickly and why do they not have a vaccine for kids?!
1/1	I have been skeptical of all medications and vaccines in the past...but in this case I will take the vaccine and be THANKFUL for it! Covid has cost us too much.
0/0	I have been told by many people that after having the vaccine they are having problems with their eyes in the light
1/1	I have been trying to get an appointment for over 65 but I get a response in northern CA out of vaccines. I hope you push to get more vaccines available. Thank you.
1/1/1/1	I have been vaccinated and the only risk for me is the pain of the needle when it's injected into me ;-;
1/1	I have been vaccinated so has my husband feel much safer!
0/0	I have been vaxxed (no booster) and am on the tail end of Covid. My husband and kids have it (not vaxxed). Guess who felt the worst?! Yup‚Ä¶ me :(
1/-1	I have been waiting for this
1/-1	I have been waiting so long to see NY rangers play!!
0/-1	I have been working since this virus started and I have not gotten sick.
0/1	I have blood cancer, I need it to be 100%
1/1	I have both shots of Pfizer. All good no problems.
1/1	I have c19 I need that vaccine
0/0	I have cancer, my cancer drug already ramps my immune system up... I don't feel comfortable mixing it with the covid vaccine... I'll pass....
1/1	I have cancer. If I get Covid, I have a less than 20% chance of living. So yes, the vaccine is 100% necessary, and I will continue to wear a mask in public until we reach the 70% vaccinated mark. If you don't get vaccinated, seriously, do NOT go to your local hospital looking for help. You can help yourself NOW by getting vaccinated.
0/0	I have carefully studied the development of the covid vaccines and many things about them are very concerning to me
1/-1	I have children who need me.
0/0	I have concerns about how quickly the vaccine was developed and the lack of long term testing. I have serious concerns about the vaccine permanently altering my own natural immunity in a way that will weaken it. I have concerns that because of that I will be left vulnerable to not only new Covid strains....but any other viruses as well. I feel there are more effective and safe ways of boosting my natural immunity, than to take a very questionable unproven vaccine.
1/1	I have concluded that there is no way that the vaccine is harmful IN ANY way.
0/0	I have covid right now. I don‚Äôt have vaccine and I don‚Äôt have any symptoms. Why would I be getting a vaccine?
0/0	I have decided against the vaccine and because of this I will soon be losing my job in a care home, but thank you so much for this
1/1	I have done my part, I chose to vaccinate. What about you? #vaccinated #Choosetovaccinate
1/1	I have enough science education that it got me some contract jobs as a medical writer in pharma. There I got to see just how elaborate and painstaking clinical trials actually are, especially with regard to participant (and by extension, patient) safety. The mRNA vaccines involved over 70,000 participants in the Phase III trials. That‚Äôs a very large trial, and there were no deaths from covid or the vaccine in the trials in the participants receiving the vaccine. There have been over 348 million vaccinations since vaccination started over a year ago. There is a figure oft-cited (pulled out-of-context from the VAERS database) of 4000 deaths of vaccinated persons: that‚Äôs 0.00115%. On the other hand you have between a 1-in-60 and a 1-in-100 chance of dying of covid with out the vaccine, and about a 1-in-12 chance of developing disabling after-effects of covid if you survive. With the vaccine, you have virtually zero chance of dying of covid or having sequelae; the worst you‚Äôll experience will be like a bad cold that lasts a couple of days. I‚Äôll take my chances with the vaccine.
1/-1	I have epilepsy. How would the vaccine make my epilepsy react ??
0/-1	I have faith in Jesus Christ
1/1	I have friends in DC, and I know it‚Äôs been difficult to get an appointment there. When you sign up at a pharmacy you cannot choose the vaccine you get either. But please still try to get the vaccine!
1/1	I have friends that are antivax sorta. I just say. Cool I‚Äôll wave to you from the beach, the bar or sporting event and music festival, you can stay paranoid. They change their view pretty quick
1/1	I have friends who are nurses and doctors - they, along with the rest of the world are sick and tired of these loud mouth people who preach anti vaccines
1/1	I have friends who participated in trials starting last spring, all doing fine. My husband and I just completed our Pfizer series yesterday, with no side effects. AND I will continue to mask when I'm out among those whose vaccine status is unknown because I believe in caring for my fellow humans.
1/1	I have full confidence this vaccine will work and get rid of this horrible pandemic and we can get things back to normal living seeing our family and friends again
1/1	I have got both covid - 19 vaccin. It is safe. Anyone who is eligible to get vaccinated must take the vaccine.
1/1	I have got two vaccines,and side effects only for three days(a bit tired).After that, everything is fine. I am a regular blood donors(28 donation), and have declared in the blood donation declaration form.There is no problems in my blood cells.
1/1	I have gotten mad over and over again over the past year at people who are endangering the lives of my family by not wearing masks, not social distancing, not staying home, and now refusing to get vaccinated. Too many people have died. So, so many.
0/0	I have gotten several nudges to take the vaccine and I'm flat out refusing. No thank you, give it to someone who wants to risk their health.
1/1	I have gotten to the point where I don‚Äôt have any sympathy for anybody that spreads misinformation about the vaccine at all. I am very tired of them continuing this pandemic.
1/1	I have had 2 Covid jabs and I get my booster shot tomorrow morning. I am still here and I am still healthy, my genetics have not changed, big shoutout and Thank you's to the scientists and health care professionals and all those working to keep us all safe from this awful disease.
1/1	I have had 2 doses Covishield
1/1/-1	I have had 2 doses Covishield. My doctor colleagues has all had Covishield. My doctor relatives have had 2 doses Covishield. And about 40 or 50 million Indians have had Covishield. My colleagues tell me admissions of elderly with COVID has fallen
1/1	I have had 3 Pfizer vaccines now, no complaints at all. Happy Christmas
1/1	I have had 3 Pfizer vaccines now, no complaints at all. Happy Christmas!
1/1	I have had 5 family members die from COVID-19. I don‚Äôt want to be next. The vaccine is very important to me .
1/1	I have had NO symptoms after taking both doses of the covid vaccine.
1/1	I have had Rona once already and still want to get the vaccine
0/0	I have had SERIOUS menstrual issues since my Pfizer covid vaccine. I had my full 2 doses. 2 months after my second dose, I had the worst menstrual cycle of my life and I've been having a period for 24 years. I was bleeding twice as much, while passing blood clots the size of my fist. I've talked to other vaccinated women who had the same exact issues..or they stopped having a period altogether.
1/1	I have had a bad reaction to a vaccine before but thankfully I was able to get better. I have Multiple Sclerosis, I was diagnosed with it when I was 11 an I'm unable to have Live vaccinations I guess, i was told this when i was very young. I'm not a Anti Vaxxer I'm for Vaccines.
0/0	I have had a severe reaction to flu shots in the past. I am allergic to nickel and Sulfa and these were ingredients in these shots which made me horribly ill for as long as 2 months and having to spend nights at the bathroom because crawling to the bathroom once took everything I had to get there. I have not taken any flu shots since the last time it caused devastating reactions for me in the late 90s. I never regretted it because I have not suffered from the flu since that horrible shot. How do I know that this shot does not contain these ingredients? I am reluctant to take the vaccine because I never fair well with secondary effects. I am allergic to opiates (such as Vicodin, morphine, and Norco), also statins, and can only tolerate a smaller dosage of lesser than 50% of Percocet without going under...as in induced into a comma I can't get out of for days. I avoid pharmaceuticals if there is a naturopathic alternative.
0/0	I have had an allergic reaction to a vaccine in the past. I‚Äôve already had COVID. I‚Äôve been told I should wait to get the vaccine. I‚Äôm very hesitant due to my allergies.
1/1	I have had asthma since childhood, breathing is such an important part of staying alive. I am also hypopituitary since 2003 so I finally elected to receive the Pfizer due to myths vs. facts from my leading endocrinologist. Absolutely no side effects. My brother passed away June 26, 2021 at age 66. He developed pneumonia covid and it scarred his lungs and his kidneys failed. He was listening to the myths of the vaccine.
1/-1	I have had bad results from the 65 and over flu shot but the chance of getting a serious illness without it is a much greater risk! I will keep getting it!
1/1	I have had both vaccinations. After the first I felt like I had a slight hangover and a sore arm, after the second only a tender arm and nothing else. It is sooo worth getting if it means we can get back to some semblance of normality sooner rather than later.
1/1/1/1/1/1	I have had both vaccines thank you to the scientists
1/1	I have had both vaccines, caught COVID and had no symptom which is unusual because my breathing and immune system gets bad with a cold.
1/1	I have had my covid19 vaccine. I have done it to protect myself , my partner and our daughter. It is worth it compared to catching covid
1/1	I have had my third shot, I love it
1/1/1/1/1	I have had my vaccine and am very grateful looking forward to the second one now. Starting to feel safer. Thankyou.
1/1	I have had my vaccine thanks. Looking forward having the second one.
1/1/1/1/1	I have had my vaccine. Thank you researchers for your ingenuity! Lifesaving work.
1/1	I have had the AZ vaccine with no problem and I am more than happy to have it again as a booster. Yes there have been issues although serious issues are minimal. Without AZ we would all still be in a lockdown with little to look forward to.
1/1	I have had the covid vaccine, I had the Oxford/astrazenecer and I have had no symptoms other than some mild aching in my legs and arms the day after I had it. I hope it is as effective as they say and fingers crossed the covid figures start to go down!
1/1/1/1	I have had the first dose. Can't wait for the second. My question for the anti vaccine brigade. Why would any government want to harm, track individual people. What is their objective you give all these horror scenarios, but WHY would every government in the world be doing this. My heartfelt love goes out to all the brilliant minds that have developed this vaccine for as I believe the GOOD for mankind.
1/1	I have had the first shot. No problems. Getting second shot 2/13. Very thankful.
1/1	I have had the first vaccine and looking forward to the second one this week. Two of my family members were hit with covid and I never want to go through the pain and suffering they went through. We need to kill this virus and I really believe that the vaccine is the only thing that will do it. To the people who are against the vaccine, I'd rather take my chance with the vaccine than taking my chance of catching the virus. We know and see what the after effects of the virus leaves you with so I will take my chance that the vaccine is had no after effects. And if it does surely it can't be any worse than the virus
1/1	I have had three Pfizer vaccinations and one influenza vaccination and yet I still haven‚Äôt turned into a magnet! Is that because I‚Äôm not American?
1/-1	I have heard testimonies from people who have had Covid from all over the world, and it's really hard to predict how a particular person's body will react to the virus. For some, it's no more than a minor cold. They get over it in about a week, and everything is just fine. However, there are others who contract the virus, and become dangerously ill... excruciating pain, gasping for air, clinging to life on their ventilators... You get my point. Just please, please be responsible people.
0/0	I have high inflammation in my stomach And is fearful of taking vaccine.
1/1	I have little hope of getting the vaccine this month but maybe in March.
0/0	I have lived 30 years with multiple auto-immunity, more than one, I just feel that that the immune system is very complicated. I would not take a vaccine unless you can prove that it's 100% safe to take one for CoVid.
1/-1	I have lost faith in humanity....
0/0	I have lost my job and ‚Äòretired‚Äô now because I am not vaccinated. I am a teacher and above 6o and I had been to all the busy places and I don‚Äôt have any symptoms or Covid (2 years now)
1/1	I have made an appointment for Sinovac vaccine
0/0	I have many friend unvaccinated that got COVID and are well in their homes and working. they were not vaccinated and do not need a vaccine. it doesn't help much. I think we were misinformed and misguided. Dos COVID exist? I think the cure may be worse then the sickness
1/1	I have many friends who used to claim that they would never get the vaccine then later I found out they were first in line to get it!
0/0	I have massive respect for this Doctor and I will say if she was my Doctor id have no problem seeing her as my Doctor. I respect her choice not to have an EXPERIMENTAL VACCINE in her body
1/1	I have missed gping to work so much, happy that things might return to normal
0/0	I have mixed feelings about all of the vaccines especially this one
0/0	I have multiple friends who never got sick prior to their first dose aswell, now they get sick often like you
1/1	I have my appointment Wednesday. I work in healthcare so I'm the only one in my family eligible. It will reduce the risk to all of us, but I really wish they could do it on a household basis. If my wife were to get sick, knowing I'm vaccinated I'll spiral into guilt. God forbid if she were to die what it'd do to me. Sure, I'll be healthy enough to take care of her, but there's not a whole hell of a lot you can do against a virus other than treat symptoms and I don't have a ventilation or ECMO laying around.
1/1	I have my appointment for Pfizer vaccine today
1/1	I have my appointment scheduled to receive the Phizer booster!
0/-1	I have my essential oils so I'm good.
1/-1/1	I have my first one booked tomorrow. I wonder if we can make this go the way of smallpox or if this will keep coming back like the flu does.
1/1	I have my flu vaccine every year because work pay for it and I don't get sick as often if I have it.
0/-1	I have my ice coffee in the mornings, I'm all set
0/0	I have my sea moss, elderberry, and vitamin c. No need for vaccine.
1/1	I have my three doses and I can honestly say that it has helped prevent me from getting sick. I used to get sick often but after getting vaccinated I‚Äôve gone from getting sick four times a year to only once.
0/0	I have myocarditis from the vaccine.
0/0	I have never been anti vaxx in my life........until now
0/0	I have never gotten a vaccine in my life and I am perfectly healthyüôèüèº
0/-1/0	I have never had a flu jab either. I haven't had flu for 12 years. I live in London. Says it all.
0/0	I have never had a flu shot! Never had the flu! Co-workers get flu shots out sick for weeks?
0/0	I have never had a vaccine and at 66 years old I m not starting now
1/0	I have never had any concerns about the safety of effectiveness of vaccines, but even if I did have legitimate concerns, I would view taking the COVID-19 vaccine as a way of protecting my loved ones from being infected by this horrible virus by me. I feel that failing to accept the COVID-19 vaccine for any reason other than legitimate medical reasons is a betrayal of their loved ones and a betrayal of our personal responsibility to keep our community safe.
0/0	I have never had any vaccines, my retarded brother had some vaccines they made him retarded
1/1	I have never heard of anyone who wouldn't get Covid 19 vaccination, even anti-vaccine idiots said they would do it so they don't have to wear masks.
0/1	I have never met a smart antivaxxer and that's the honest truth
0/1/-1	I have never n all my life, not even n polio days, seen such HYSTERIA BY SO MANY CHICKEN LITTLES---and nearly all of the CHICK LITTLES R GULLIBLE dimwitted democrats!!!
0/0	I have never seen a vaccine can protect from any type of illness so why this fusss about vaccines? Why doctors or scientists don't get busy in investing discovering cures about existent illness like cancer, heart, liver and other internal or external body illnesses?
0/0	I have never seen a vaccine developed this quickly
0/0	I have never signed up for any experimental treatment and don't plan to start because of a 0.whatever mortality rate.
0/0	I have never taken the FLU vaccines and I won't be taken any Coronavirus vaccines because I would like to die natural death. So people work with the WORLD health organisation can take all mine Coronavirus vaccines I don't want NO POISONS goinig into my my body
0/0	I have never trusted the COVID -19 vaccine since it seems sketchy.
0/0	I have news for these tyrants: I will NEVER take their RNA-destroying "vaccine" under ANY circumstances! They attempt to rape me with a needle I'll protect myself with hot high-velocity lead!
1/1	I have no problem with vaccine where can I get 2 doses asap want to get back to living
1/1	I have no sympathy for anti-vaxers who die of covid.
1/1	I have no sympathy for these people they are the same people that are causing children who can't have a vaccine to get covid
0/0	I have no sympathy towards anyone who voluntarily took those lethal jabs. The truth is out there for all to read.
0	I have not and will not take the Covid shot and I feel great. The only time I start feeling sick at my stomach is when I see that so called expert Dr. Falsey on the news.
0	I have not been vaccinated because it was developed so quickly. Vaccines usually take close to 10 years to develop. At the beginning they said 1 shot, now it's 3
1/1	I have not had Covid this entire pandemic and I‚Äôm getting my vaccine in 106 hours, so freakin lucky like wow
1/0	I have not had a vaccine since the early 80s when I was in the navy . I got my first covid19 shot yesterday . I was not an anti vaxxer thinking vaccines are dangerous . I just thought I did not need them . The last true symptomatic flu experience was in the late 80s . The last 20 years I have had few experiences with colds and intestinal viruses . I figured my immune system was pretty good but being in this pandemic it may have been more about not being around sick people as I dont work in an office and dont normally go to mass gatherings . Even going out to dinner is rare . So in a way I may have mitigated contagions without making a conscious effort .doing so . Now why get the covid Vaccine ? I think the big factor is my body has no immunity to it so its a crap shoot on how it will react . I have grandkids now going back to school and playing little league which makes me more vulnerable as kids are the mosquitoes of contagion spread . I will be abit more aware of the grandkids in the future if they appear to be symptomatic with an illness and may avoid them until they are well . Just getting a cold sucks and if I can avoid that I will .Mitigation does work as they have not been sick this hole pandemic . Not even a runny nose .
1/1	I have not noticed any side effects at all, except a little sore arm.
1/1	I have not seen ANY headlines of covid vaccine creating an allergic reaction
1/1	I have noticed there is a marked increase in anti vaccine rhetoric under the guise of Christian belief. It is scary.They believe it‚Äôs a Scam,everything apparently.I really think they oppose what ever is being discussed. And they are all experts they can‚Äôt spell it,but they know!
0/0	I have one primary reason: There is no way of knowing, now, if there will be long term negative health effects caused by vaccination.
0/1	I have paperwork that shows I have the antibodies. Form my doctor/virologist. Works just fine.
0/0	I have permanent brain damage from the MMR immunization. I used to be very, very, very supportive of vaccines.
1/0	I have plenty of health issues right now so I will probably wait until they resolve before taking the vaccine.
0/0	I have problems concentrating - Effects from other vaccines that were injected into me without my permission when I was an Infant. So I couldn't get past 35 seconds of this video
1/1	I have read a lot of article's and watched a lot of different news programs and I believe the science in the vaccines. I do believe they will help and be a big benefit to all of us. I will do the humane and responsible thing to do and get the vaccine..
0/0	I have read reports of those who have had an terrible reaction and some deaths, after receiving the vaccine. Why are these reports being heard of? Why are the seemingly being hushed?
0/0	I have read that the vaccine permanently changes DNA and cells detrimentally. It may be fine now but in a year or next infection natural immunity is impaired forever. Want to understand what is being injected before I agree.
1/-1	I have read vaccine hesitant folks tend to be moved more by personal anecdotes, something to consider.
1/1/1/1	I have received both of my Covid-19 shorts and my entire family as well! If we don't all take this dead serious it will never end, so everyone please jump on board and get yours please!
1/1	I have received both vaccines shots. No problem. A little arm soreness, but a hot shower fixed that. Not sure why people are hesitant. I was around during the polio and small pox vaccines. I remember when all the scare tactics being spread back then. Here we are today no polio and no small pox.
1/1	I have received my first dose of COVID-19 awaits second dose of COVID-19 in June
1/1	I have recieved both doses of the biontech vaccine and I'm fine. Do you want this pandemic to go on forever? Get woke people
1/1	I have registered for Pfizer ( but Lack of availability) I got Moderna. Is that okay?
1/1	I have run out of f**ks to give about people who do not wear masks, claim it's a conspiracy, refuse to take vaccines once proven safe, etc. It's their right to foolishly harm themselves I guess.
0/0	I have saved my children from vaccinations because of a stranger at a business seminar that has informed me of his opinion about vax, 4yrs before I had my 1st kid. There are people that listen.
1/-1	I have seen many people who got vaccinated with covidshield are totally fine and some of them just had fever and took a paracetamol and got good again. You don't have any other option either get vaccinated and be safe or survive without vaccination and boost up your immunity
0/0	I have seen more people get the virus after being vaccinated than ever before.
0/-1	I have seen people talking about how healthcare has stopped vaccination and a alien race is ready to replace us cause we're getting vaccinated
0/0	I have seen so much dishonesty through this pandemic why should i trust this vaccine
0/0	I have seen videos of side effects.
1/1	I have several diseases from epilepsy to autoimmune dysfunction and cannot receive vaccines due to adverse reactions in the past. But I would never force others to not get vaccines because I know that they wouldn‚Äôt have a reaction like I have.
0/0	I have severe allergies and I was hospitalized for anaflaxia. There's no way I'm risking my life with this vaccine.
0/0/0/0	I have sickle cell anemia. I'm not taking the vaccine until they do study on people like me. I'm on vitamin D3 and liquid vitamin A - zink. My diet is all organic I don't eat fast food, I cook my meals.
0/0	I have so much pressure to have this vaccine but my gut tells me no.
1/1	I have sore arm today but feeling grateful to have gotten my first dose of the vaccine. Have a happy hump day ya‚Äôll!!
1/1	I have tachycardia and other health issues and I wasn't worried about the vaccine at all. COVID is so much more dangerous to your heart.
1/1	I have taken all Covid vaccination recommended by the CDC & FDA including the booster. I have had NO adverse reactions from them, and neither has the rest of my family.
1/1	I have taken all the vaccines except the mmr vaccine because of allergy and I'm thankful to every person who takes that vaccine.
1/1	I have taken all vaccine dose including boostor dose too so I'm feeling much more safe but i always stay safe and follow the covid protocol, thank you
1/1	I have taken both the dose of Covishield our Indian vaccine in association with Oxford I didn't get fever everything is ok till now & I m below 35 so I think the vaccine is safe
1/1	I have taken dose 1 and dose 2 vaccines I recommend others to take
0/0/0/0	I have taken every vaccines of various dieseases as prescribed age wise since childhood. But looking at numerous unreported side effects after vaccination in India, I am feeling tensed and skeptical about this one.
1/1	I have taken mine too and I can say it's fully safe and their is no magnetic field anywhere
1/1	I have taken the vaccine, never felt healthier and stronger
1/1	I have taken three pfizer shots üòÅ Feeling good.
1/1	I have them all!
1/1	I have three more weeks until I get my second Moderna. So excited! Not for the day after, of course.
1/1	I have to admit I'm selfish and mostly did it for myself but hopefully one day I'll be able to visit my out of province elderly parents and other at risk relatives.
0/0	I have to admit, I am more afraid of the vaccine than I am of covid 19.
1/1	I have to agree with what has been said. Getting the COVID vaccine is beneficial not only for yourself, but for everyone around you. I believe that getting vaccinated is a way for me to do my part in combating this pandemic. I also agree with what others have said about the procedure of making the vaccine. The vaccine was expedited, as is understandable given the circumstances, but it still went through all the necessary steps that any other vaccine goes through. The number of health care workers and individuals in science fields who have received the vaccine also speaks to its reliability. If they had doubts about the vaccine they wouldn't be getting it in the first place.
1	I have to be protected. But I don‚Äôt want to take something that‚Äôs going to be useless and potentially causes me harm.
1/1/1/1	I have to say I am relieved to see how many people want the vaccine. I was worried about the anti vax population but all I‚Äôve seen so far is people begging to get it
1/1	I have to say I want take it
1/1	I have to wait until September before the vaccines will become available to my age group.
1/1	I have to wonder if Jenner received as much push back when he developed a small pox vaccine. This was the world's first vaccine. Now small pox is a thing of the past. Did Dr. Salk get a lot of anti vax push back for his polio vaccine? Polio is almost wiped out now.
1/1	I have two little girls getting the shots as soon as they are available. And seeing as how we live in Oklahoma there shouldn't be any lines waiting to get them. We can probably just walk right up to the pharmacy and get them within minutes.
0/0	I have two vaccine due to government regulation. Now I get flu almost each month while before I was getting flu once in two year. I feel my immunity got weak.
0	I have under lined health conditions and I will not be having this vaccine
0/0	I have under lined health conditions and I will not be having this vaccine.
0/0	I have under lined health conditions and I will not be having this vaccine. The day my family are aloud one then I may have it
1/-1	I have underlying conditions an contracting covid will kill me.
1/1	I have underlying medical issues so I will be getting the Covid-19 vaccine when it's my turn and when my doctor tell me it's time. . . I am excited to get the shot
1/-1/1	I have very little hope. I work in the construction industry and 3/4 of the guys I work with refuse to get the vaccine.
0/0	I have zero desire to get the vaccine. Zero.
0/0	I have zero desire to take the vaccine
1/1	I have zero issue in taking a Covid19 vaccine when it's made available.
1/1	I have zero issue in taking a Covid19 vaccine when it's made available. Having nearly every top research facility working on a vaccine should show how many eyes are on the various approaches used. I do believe those researchers have the very best intentions in mind for vaccines, yet you don't know the adverse effects of something that large until years after its deployed.
0/0	I have zero plans to ever get vaccinated for covid since it does not effect me. The only reason why I know that I had covid in the first place was due to serological testing.
0/0	I have zero trust in big pharma. Zero trust in the government. Fuck a vaccine. The mrna stuff arent even vaccines. lts a brand new technology. And they are lying about what it is.
0/-1	I haven t taken a shot yet. Why wouldn t I wait for the next vaccine?
0/0	I haven't been ill for many years and I'm simply extremely afraid that I'll ruin my immune system, which always works perfectly, or that my body will become dependent on the active ingredients in the injection.
0/-1	I haven't changed anything with how I live since covid. I don't use a mask. I don't distance. I have felt completely fine. I'm not living in fear.
1/1	I haven't gotten a vaccine since I was a baby, probably. But I will certainly get this one
0/0/0/0/0/0	I haven't gotten the flu shot, I don't get the flu. I'm not getting this either. "But it's free." Nothing is free, everything has a price.
1/1	I haven't had a covid vaccine, not because of conspiracy theories etc but because I've had covid at least twice and am awash with antibodies. However, I am not antivax and have had every other vaccine. This is very different so please think again.
0/0	I haven't had a flu shot since I was 8.my dad took me both of us were sick two days later neither have had it since üôÉ

1	I haven‚Äôt heard about any side effects, Even if we don‚Äôt trust it [will protect us], it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to get vaccinated.‚Äù
0/0	I hear #Novavax has been approved in Australia. Still not getting #vaccinated. Ironically, if the government hadn't pushed the #CovidVaccine so violently, I wouldn't have done so much research into #vaccines. I don't think I'll ever take a #vaccine again.
1/1	I hear Utah hopefully doesn't have any rules around who they vaccinate (in state vs out of state). Everyone should get it
0/0	I hear first hand from a medic , the vaccine destroys your immune system
0/0	I hear of all the side-effects people experience from covid and I'm turned off by a potential reduced chance of getting sick compared to a more likely chance of me getting side-effects from vaccines.
0/-1	I hear the vaccine gives you penis spiders with perfect 5G LTE reception.
1/1	I hear you. I had a severe case of anaphylactic shock which almost killed me - but I wouldn't try to put others off having the vaccine because this reaction is rare and as a country we need to move on and get on with life.
1/1	I hear your concern about the rushed timeline, but I am a part of the Moderna trial and (very likely) received the vaccine and can say that it is safe with only minor side effects for ~12-14 hours after injections.
1/1	I heard a lot of "I'll let other people take it first to see how it goes" turn into I want to get it asap. So far so good
0/0	I heard it alters the person's DNA ??? Not in my body
1/-1	I heard it claimed the COVID vaccine didn't fall under the legal definition of a vaccine. Is there any truth to this?
1/1	I heard many of our people in UK, reject to take Vaccines.We in Somaliland are knocking every door and searching any favouritism at any cost to have one.Please don't lose this chance.Yes death is at he hands of Allah, but to give yourself due care, is Allah's order.

0/0	I heard over a radio call in that the vaccine has a permanent sterilization effect. If so, would that be permanent sterilization for this USA and worldwide. If this is true what is the "ingredient" in the vaccine that would cause the sterilization????

0/0	I honestly don‚Äôt know any sane person that is planning on getting it
1/1	I honestly found middle ground with this but im more on vaccine side.
1/1	I honestly had no side effects, not even really any soreness after the shot, I was really surprised,
1/0	I honestly wish I could have volunteered for the vaccine trials. I'm a full time mother of three, though, and couldn't take the risk. I'll be, masked, in that line with you.
1/1	I hope COVID kills them all
0/0	I hope I get COVID so I can prove to people that I've had bouts of food poisoning that are more serious and life threatening than a hyped up virus. Have you ever eaten bad fajitas? That will kill you faster than COVID.
1/1	I hope Pfizer can match the expected production. Would be nice to have 100 million doses per month.
1/1	I hope Pfizer reaches the expectations of people and manufacture as many as possible quickly
1/0	I hope after all the wealthy countries get finished, they band together and get the rest of us vaccines! Unless we vaccinate a high enough percentage of the world... it will all be wasted

1/1	I hope everyone just freakin gets vaccinated! Come on people!
0/0	I hope everyone that does get a vaccine ends up being well, but I can't say I'm comfortable getting a medicine that doesn't have 5-10 years of rigorous real world testing to various, unforeseen consequences and interactions.
0/0	I hope everyone that does get a vaccine ends up being well, but I can't say I'm comfortable getting a medicine that doesn't have 5-10 years of rigorous real world testing to various, unforeseen consequences and interactions. It seems like an overreaction to get humans en mass to test these new medicines. We have animal trials for a reason.
1/1	I hope everyone will be safer and happier and healthy now
0/0	I hope for once the jews are not involved in this hate crime against america. Do we have some names of people to blame yet?
0/0	I hope none of y'all take that vaccine and why would people need to take it if they're not even sick??
1/1	I hope others countries follow suit and help provide vaccines üíâ to other places . This is a WORLD üåé issue!
1/1	I hope people realize that the pro-vaccine people are all doctors, and experts while the anti-vaxxers are uneducated people.

1/1	I hope this pandemic has convinced some of the anti vax commuinty that the world without vaccines would not be a good place
1/1	I hope this pandemic teaches anti-vaccine people to get their children a vaccine. They don't cause autism or brain damaage. If you are anti-vaccine and reading this, your precious child/children could die because of you. If you truly loved them then get them their shots.
1/1	I hope this vaccine has success and can be available
1/1	I hope this vaccine will work for all of us
1/-1	I hope this will open some minds. I don't generally listen to anyone medical except my dr. but I am bombarded by all the misinformation so needed to do some research on my own. Thank you for clarity.

1/1	I hope to get the booster this weekend.
1/1	I hope we adopt Israel‚Äôs strategy and just vaccinate everyone who wants a shot.
0/1	I hope we do that in the Philippines too. Here they don't let us go inside the malls, they don't let us use public transportation, can't get a job without vaccination, they don't let us go out even though we don't have symptoms. They are really looking for ways for us to choose to be vaccinated.

1/1	I hope you all are getting vaccinated! It will save so many!!
0/0	I hope you are against all Covid 19 vaccine mandates-not just boosters!FDA tricked y‚Äôall into thinking they approved. Comirnaty does not exist. 22076 dead per cdc/Vaers.son kicked out of college. I‚Äôm thrilled he doesn‚Äôt have that shit in his body.don‚Äôt be sheep!digital id coming!
1/-1	I hope you post this on Facebook as a video. Its the place where people make assumptions from half of the data and spread false information.
1	I hope your vaccine will be available soon for children in Hungary too!
1/1	I hugged my mama‚Äôs neck for the first time in 13 mos today. Vaccines made that possible. I‚Äôm so grateful.
1/1	I intend to do this as well ASAP. My family lives in New York and they're all vaccinated.
1	I joined the #CovidVaccine club today. Thank you Israel. Feels good, like making progress towards better times.
1/1	I joined this sub early March when we all seemed to be doomed for unforeseeable years to come. Less than a year later, and two vaccines are being submitted to the FDA. Science is amazing. We‚Äôve come a long way.
1/1	I jumped on my chance to get the vaccine as soon as the opportunity presented itself. These people are so ungrateful for their chance to beat this.
0/-1	I just Love a good propaganda campaign
1/1	I just booked my COVID vaccine appt for tomorrow!!!! Yay!
1/1/1	I just bought my ticket to NY. I leave Greece on May 5th. I've given up getting a vaccine here, so off to The US I go.
1/1	I just can't feel sorry for anyone who gets the virus and isn't vaccinated!
1/1	I just cant believe how science became a sensitive topic.
1/-1	I just crossed 6 months since I got my 2 shots and also the 3rd shot booster. I am at a loss if I need another. I ve called the COVID hotline, pharmacies, and the Dept of Health. Only reply from all of them is that is a good question .
1/-1	I just don't get it. Why do these anti-vaccine feel the need to stop others from getting a vaccine? If you don't want one that's fine by me.
1/1	I just don't know where to put my face after so many people using god as a foundation of anti vaccination, like can't you just shut up you embarrassing me in front of the atheist
0/0	I just don't take vaccines that I don't need. There's plenty vaccines I haven't got and I won't get a vaccine cause it's the in risk now.
0/0	I just don't trust it
1/1	I just don't understand these people. I personally knew 3 people who died of Covid. I have an Indian friend who lost 8 relatives during the Delta wave. Between a few other friends there is 4. Grand total is now 15. Go online and look up the over dozen of conservative radio/podcasters who've died from it. WHAT will it take?
0/0	I just don't understand why the Covid 19 vacation is being pushed so hard
0/0	I just don't want to do it. I'm young and healthy. I hate how I'm basically being forced to do it because I won't be admitted to certain areas
1/1	I just don‚Äôt know how people can not consider others when choosing not getting the vaccine. For me, obviously was trying to protect myself and my husband, but another huge factor was protecting others in my community. I have elderly neighbors, immunocompromised neighbors, neighbors with small children‚Ä¶ what about them? Don‚Äôt they matter? Shouldn‚Äôt we do what we can to keep each other safe during this pandemic? Isn‚Äôt it the least we can do for one another?
0/0	I just don‚Äôt like being the very first person to try anything brand new.
0/0	I just don‚Äôt want it because I don‚Äôt want it. Do I really need a reason other than that?
0/0	I just don‚Äôt want to take a shot that was made in 9 months
1/1	I just feel bad for small percentage people who can't get the vaccine or doesn't work for them. I had a teacher who got the chicken pox vaccine but her body doesn't make the right antibody's for it. She relies on everyone else being vaccinated for her safety.
1/1	I just feel bad for the doctors, i could not care less about the patients that refuse to get vaccinated after getting covid.
0/0	I just feel sad about the whole thing. A friend told me the other day that one of the vaccines made him sicker than when he got covid (after getting the vaccine).
0/0	I just feel so sorry for those people that can't wake up and see the BS being pushed.
0/-1	I just find it odd that for years they don't have a vaccine for hepatitis C, diabetes, aids or for the common colds but in 12 months they got one for covid. Is it safe for all people even with serious conditions?
1/1	I just finished listening to an Interview about vaccines where @LukwesaBurak was speaking with @melindagates , who praised Nigeria's efforts to end Polio and containing Ebola. Hoping that same efforts could be used on the #CovidVaccine to end this pandemic. NaijaFisted hand
1/1	I just finished my 2nd fully vaccinated just before today, thank you for your explanation! Now I'm waiting the side effects in Japan. I'm young, so I hope my side effects will not be severe.
1/1	I just got 1st dose (Pfizer) because of being scared, confused and concerned about underlying issues conflicting with it and truthfully did feel slightly ill after and still fearful of side effects but at same time I felt it more important and safer to take the bet* of LIVING and being able to see and enjoy LIFE.
1/1	I just got JJ today at my VA It's been 10hrs and not even a sore arm... all's good !!!

1/1	I just got my first dose! I'm so glad to see others participating, too.
1/1	I just got my first of the two Moderna shots. No side effects other than a little soreness around the injection spot. Now, please note that I'm over 50, fat, lazy, stupid, and American. So the majority of people in the comments below should expect no more side effects than I had.
1/1	I just got my first shot (pfizer).

1/1/1/1	I just got my second dose and no reaction to any dose whatsoever.
1/1	I just got my second dose of Moderna Thursday!! 8 out of 9 of my coworkers who also got the second dose (either moderna or pfizer) had fever, chills, brain fog, muscle aches, and some intense sweating that lasted 24-48 hours. All in all it's better than putting ourselves and our elderly patients at risk! If anything I feel more confident in my protection against covid because I had such an immune reaction.
1/1	I just got my second dose today!!
1/1	I just got my second dose yesterday, so that's me right now with the ibuprofen. The first one took me out for a day too, so thankfully I warned my boss ahead of time that I'd probably be taking a day off. Now I'm worried I'll be out for two.
1/1	I just got my second dose. Super happy I did , but I feel like shit. Body chills like I've never had before.
1/1	I just got my third dose as an immunocompromised person! At the hospital I work at, 1/3 of our patient population has Covid. Most are aged 40-50 and only 2 of the 68 Covid patients had both of their vaccinations. You‚Äôre not invincible!!! People are on 100% oxygen with saturation‚Äôs in the 80s. Delta is scary as hell.

1/1	I just got the J&J Saturday. No side effects so far. Barely a sore arm.
1/1	I just got the Pfizer vaccine and weas feeling a little under the weather before I got it I don't think it was covid so I didnt get tested for it, am I going to be okay or should I be worried that I got the vaccine while feeling tha way ?
0/0	I just got the covid vax and I've been experiencing many symptoms. Some of which are too embarrassing to list BUT I will any way. The day after I got the vaccine I got an intense urge to strip down my clothes and piss in my neighbor's garden, the vaccine also made my urine more acidic than it usually is and it burnt through her flowers, I ran around my neighborhood like a crazy man and had explosive diarrhea. DONT GET THE VACCINE

1/1	I just had my first shot Monday, second one is in a few weeks! Have been seeing a bunch of friends also getting theirs the past week or so. None of us are elderly or front line workers or anything (all roughly mid-late 30s), so seems like it‚Äôs finally getting distributed to average-risk people, at least in VA.
1/1	I just had my first shot of AstraZeneca vaccine last March 22nd.
1/1	I just had my second Pfizer Covid jab yesterday. I am a 73 year old male living in the UK. In both experiences the only thing I noted was a very slight soreness of the arm, very mild cold like symptoms, runny nose and feeling a tiny bit off colour. Otherwise great. I would recommend the jabs to anyone. In my opinion not to get them (Unless you have valid underlying health issues) is misguided. Keep well folks
0/1	I just had my second shot my teeth turned blue and hair fell out every time I turn on the microwave oven I fart the theme song to Jeopardy bark like a dog and poop my pants. Other than that I feel great I've never felt so woff ! woff ! woff ! Alive
1/1	I just had the vaccine. I feel totally fine. Don? worry too much people.
1/1	I just had the vaccine. I feel totally fine. Don‚Äôt worry too much people
1/1	I just had the vaccine. I feel totally fine. Don‚Äôt worry too much people.
0/1/-1	I just hope all the thousands who rushed right in, pushed their way in line, couldn't wait to get the double shot whammy, did not make a really big mistake and live to regret it.
1/1/1/1	I just hope that a lot of people do trust the vaccine despite it being made that fast.
0/0	I just hope this whole sorry charade stops before they start vaccinating children...
0/1	I just know there's something in there that is going to negatively affect black people.
0/0	I just learned that air we breathe and water are full of bacteria everything is so scary üò± is there a vaccine to stop me breathing and drinking?? maybe if we all wear plastic bags around our heads we won't catch a coldüò≥
0/0	I just learned you can‚Äôt sue the vaccine maker for side effects. Long term effects of mRNA vaccine is unknown. I personally know people who would rather take a conventional inactive vaccine instead of mRNA. We should change the current law.
1/1	I just ordered the Sputnik vaccine on eBay. It recommends 2 doses so I got 4 just to be sure. Only ¬£18.95 free postage
1/1/1	I just received my 2nd shot last night at Ford Field and between my 1st shot and now, I have experienced ZERO SIDE EFFECTS, not even a sore arm, "ZERO SIDE EFFECTS"
1/1	I just received my first dose (12/20) but still feel optimistic until 1/10 when I receive my second dose.
1/1	I just received my first dose of the vaccine! I hope you all are being safe and everyone can get it soon.
1/1	I just received my first dose today. So far so good. Only a minor headache few a few hours and some groggy feeling although I will say my injection site feels like I got kicked by a horse.
1/1	I just received the 2nd vacinne 2days ago. I am now very good condition.
1/1	I just received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine yesterday. The only side effect that I experienced is "soreness" plus I also noticed that I am starting to talk and act like these two dudes. That's not cool, so don't call me culo!
1/1	I just recovered from Covid and I plan to get the vaccine as soon as I am allowed to do so.
1/1	I just signed up to see if they will take me in a phase 3 trial ü§ô
1/1	I just started my vaccine and I am disappointed. I mean these antivaxxers aid that this would make you magnetic which it hasn't. I am very disappointed with the anti-axis cuz it's ruins my plans to walk to a bank and Rob it and when the police show up with guns drawn to arrest me I could stop their bullets with my new magnetic powers or take the guns out of their hands with my magnetic powers again very disappointed
0	I just took the second vaccine and I feel like I‚Äôm getting a heart attack right now
0/0	I just took the vaccine cuz it‚Äôs required by my college, otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt have taken it.
0/0	I just trust my immune system....this jab is like the ice bucket challenge
1/1	I just want a vaccine
1/1	I just want the people to play with rust equipment if they believe vaccines don't work
1/1	I just want this to end this pandemic
1/1	I just want to as that if Covid vaccine is safe because other vaccines were being made for years
1/1/1	I just want to be vaccinated...
1/1	I just want to get vaccinated
1/1	I just want to get vaccinated so I can go out and meet my girlfriend
0/0	I just want to know why we have to wear masks if the vaccine works?
1/1	I just want to let you know that this video helped me and other friends decide to take the vaccine. I was hesitant but after looking at all the phases, I felt like it was pretty safe to take. Thank you for this! Now I even have my booster
0/0	I just want to say to EVERYONE pushing the Jab. Good luck at Nuremberg 2.0
0/1	I just want to see it be used a bit more and see the effects it has before I take it.
1/1/1/1	I just want to thank you and all of the people who worked so hard to develop the Covid vaccine. I got my first dose on Friday. My only reaction was a slightly sore arm at the injection site. THANK YOU !!!
0/0	I just want to wait...I'm not against vaccines but I'm skeptical of the covid vaccines.
0	I just wanted normal life back and I, stupidly, overlooked potential issues. Last spring when they became readily available the narrative was take this and have your life back. Thats a powerful message and I fell for it. Now I see that it was all complete bullshit and they have been lying to us more than I knew. Won't be taking a single booster or listening to anything they say from now on.
1/1	I just wanted to say that I have recently gotten the Covid vaccine as a 16 year old so I can protect, my family, friends, and I from Covid. I also got it because my grandpa was in the hospital not related to Covid and after he was in the hospital for a little while, he got Covid and died from it. If his nurses were vaccinated at that time or even himself, he probably would have survived and would still be alive today. That‚Äôs another reason why I got the vaccine, so no one has to go through what I went through with my grandpa.
0/-1	I just wonder why does the whole world needs to be vaccinated?
0/0	I keep hearing people who are not nurses and doctors say trust the science and get the vaccine. If real nurses and doctors with years of training and experience are willing to lose their jobs by not taking the vaccine.. I WILL TRUST THAT SCIENCE.
1/1	I keep reading that mixing vaccinations is good! The mRNA vaccinations seem to be better.
1/1	I keep seeing really stupid memes on my feeds saying "if it doesn't prevent Covid-19, why are we getting vaccinated". This is why. It prevents death, it works.
0/0	I keep seeing too many people talking about someone they know dropping dead 2-3 weeks after the booster shots from a heart attack. Why the hell would I wanna go get vaccinated?
1/1	I keep telling everyone I know to go read up on why this new medical tech is so awesome. It's going to change the world and help develop treatments and cures for other fatal diseases.
1/1	I keep thinking how my grandmother told me about whooping cough and measles, both of which she went through as a child, and polio, which spared the family; she wouldn‚Äôt let my mom go to the pool one year because the polio had been around. I was able to get vaccinated for all of these ailments, and my generation never worried about them. But viruses are always looking for a chance, so we have another one sweeping the world with millions dead. And there‚Äôs a vaccine for it now. In many countries people would jump at a privilege being offered Americans free. They know that running the infectious disease treadmill isn‚Äôt much fun. Please get your Covid shots
1/1	I keep thinking that this pandemic is planet Earth trying to save itself. The people who don't believe in science and vaccines also tend to not believe in climate change or the need to protect our natural resources. Perhaps the virus (including likely new, possibly worse, ones) is our planet's attempt to get rid of those who are destroying it.
1/1	I keep waking up hoping the positive energy I put out there and good karma will finally come back my way and I can get a vaccine!
0/0	I kind of follow along what my daughter says. She‚Äôs a school nurse at a high school, just to the south of us. She doesn‚Äôt believe in it.
1/-1	I knew my nieces had autism since they were newborns. There was something off about them. They were always crying for no reason. I told my sisters And they didnt believe me. Grew up and then diagnosed. I knew before they ever got vaccinated
1/-1	I knew the cheese slice model so far only from aviation, because also there it explains very well that a catastrophe occurs only by the failure of several components. And every time a plane crashes, a new "cheese slice" is added by the appropriate authorities. But regarding vaccination, this should get much more coverage.
0/0	I knew the vaccine wasn't ready when I heard about it the first time. Why did I know this?? Because all the other vaccines out there took years to be made while this one is made as as fast as they announce that the coronavirus is spreading. I told some people that they shouldn't get the rushed vaccine cause I was scared for their health but they brushed it off and said that I was just another Karen trying to prevent them from being safe :(
0/0	I knew this Vaccine was not safe,, people are dying that has been fully vaccinated and still get sick
1/1	I knew this from other sources but Vox has done an awesome job with illustrations explaining it in layman's terms. It should be linked at public health websites.
0/0	I knew two people that took the vaccine and guess what? The both dead and didn't even have the virus!
0/0	I know 2 people personally (close to me) that died of covid-19. I know 4 people personally (also close to me) that died within 30 days of receiving the vaccine. I had covid, but to me symptoms were mild. I'm worried about this vaccine
0/0	I know 2 people personally who've had bad side affects from the poison jabs. They're not vaccines they're experimental gene therapy
1/1	I know 3 people already got J&J ,all doing well and this happened about month ago.these people who got sick or reactions they are sick from sitting home not working üòÉü§£ üè†üè†
1/1	I know 3 people now who have died after contracting covid! It‚Äôs so upsetting that people don‚Äôt want to get the vaccine! It‚Äôs not just an insult to those who have died, it‚Äôs an insult to those who have developed the vaccine and have studied these sciences for years!
1/1	I know 6 unvaccinated people dead of covid. None of my vaccinated friends have had a rough time with it. Congratulations on your luck. 900,000 people in the US are not that lucky.
1/1	I know I looked away from the needle And yes, I know I need a tan But I am so confident that the #Covid19 vaccine is safe & effective that I decided to take it myself
1/-1	I know I might die, but the vaccine is worth the risk, right?
1/1	I know I should not be on the internet but I‚Äôm literally twelve and I have fully vaccinated since July, and I never had any side affects it may be different for others but it wasn‚Äôt bad at all.
0/0	I know MANY vaccinated people who have had covid.
0/0	I know a guy that's strong as an ox and got his 3rd and right after he was being rushed to the hospital in ambulance and a two day stay for heart attack symptoms.
1/1	I know a guy who was vaccinated once, next day - hit by a bus, killed instantly, coincidence? BaN VAcCinATIonS!
0/0	I know a lot of unvaccinated people that have gotten COVID and were fine after a week. Two family members fully vaccinated, no previous health conditions are not doing well at all. ü§îü§î
0/0	I know a perfectly healthy man under 40 that had a heart attack within 15 days of being given his first jab. No thanks
0/0	I know a person that become autistic after get a vaccine
1/1	I know a woman who is 95 and had both MODERNA vaccines already ,she is doing fine afterwards
0/0	I know all doctors who try to earn the people not to take these vaccines lost there licence and their videos taken down...So when you hear a doctor telling you it's safe to take the vaccine I sure would not believe them..
0/0	I know already many people who have issues with the vaccination. Much more that people who got sick by covid-19.
0/0	I know few people who died after a vaccine! This is a propoganda video!
0/0	I know for sure I'm never getting it! God Bless
0/0	I know how I'll end. up if I take that vaccine. exactly like the aliens in my videos. they're called J-rods and they're humans from the future. so no, thanks, I ain't taking the vaccine
1	I know how you feel jimmy. I got my vaccinations and I got Covid on Christmas Eve. My wife was negative. So we had to stay home. We had everything packed ready to go to the family and then I got the call. It was a great Christmas though. Hope everyone had a great Christmas!
0/0	I know it was the vaccine that changed my baby cousin forever no one can tell me different
0/0	I know its crazy and scary at the same time but it seems they are very focused on getting the mRNA into everyones body and really pushing the other 2. They are all bad but it seems there is a HIT out for this one especially.
0/0	I know many people who got vaxed and still got covid this is pathetic
0/-1	I know more people in hospital from the vaccine than covid.
0/0	I know more vaccinated ppl who have caught covid MULTIPLE TIMES, vs unvaccinated ppl i know who have NEVER gotten covid and have the antibodies their own bodies made and from monoclonal therapy. STOP pushing your vaccines and start pushing these therapies so we can get thru this!
0/0	I know my bodys immune system has a 98% chance of dealing with it, why would I want or need a vaccine?
0/0	I know of 6 different people having liver problems within a month of taking the shot. There must be a Tylenol epidemic
0/0	I know of other people that have died after receiving the vaccine as well but this is not being posted on the news...When was an elderly patient that had blotches all over the body within 24 hours receiving receiving the vaccine and died three days later
1	I know of some other sites that weren't as efficient but the majority of those bugs have been worked out. So if anyone is worrying about going to a mass vaccine site, please don't hesitate.
0/0	I know one thing: I certainly don‚Äôt plan on going anywhere. I refuse to take this vaccine.
0/0	I know our technology has evolved tremendously but Nah....m
0/0	I know people that had the 3rd shot and died from covid19
0/0	I know people that have had heart attacks weeks after having their booster, why do you think the right to sue these pharmaceutical company‚Äôs were taken away?
0/0	I know people who have gotten the shot twice, and they still got the Coronavirus again. So the shot doesn't protect you.
1/1	I know people who have had covid 3x and they still refuse to get the vaccine but complain on how sick they are. ???? Like bro just get it
0/0	I know people who know people who died after taking the vax. I don‚Äôt know anyone personally that has died of Covid, but a lot that have had it.
0	I know people who struggle to sleep, have had constant headaches , 2 strokes and one death after being vaccinated.
0/0	I know ppl who got their shots and then got Covid, question is: would they got Covid if they wouldnt got shots?
1/1	I know right........99.9% of the people who have taken the vaccines already are doing perfectly fine.......That 0.01% experiencing side effects just isn't worth the risk. Lmao.
0/0	I know several people who have had both COVID and the vaccine. Every one said they felt worse after the vaccine than they did when they had COVID.
1/1	I know some folks are against the vaccine, but some people I work with who had Covid have long-term fatigue and exhaustion. I got the vaccine. I hope you shake it shortly!
1/1	I know some people even had to call out from work because of this. Personally, having nothing to do makes me focus on the symptoms more so I would rather just go on with my days like normal.
1/1	I know someone whose mother died of covid last year and she refuses to get vaccinated. For the life of me I do not understand it.
1/1	I know that it's a long while before we know the effect of the vaccine. I was responding to my being allergic to egg, the jab did not cause an immediate reaction like other medications do.
1/1	I know that there are some black people who aren't trusting the safety of the COVID vaccine. As a black RN I encourage all African American's to get the vaccine. They aren't injecting you with COVID That's lie. If you're offered the vaccine take it and save your life!
1/1	I know that there is more work to do to repair the frustration and fatigue in our country as a result of the pandemic, but we have come a long way in one year. Life-saving vaccines and an increase in our supply of tests are helping us get on track to moving beyond the pandemic.
1/1	I know that this still means wearing a mask, taking precautions, social distancing where possible, and doing my part to help our country develop herd immunity to this awful virus so I'll do it!
1/1	I know the history of vaccine since how the variolation had born so i believe vaccine very much.
1/1	I know there are massive COVID vaccination deficits in the US and across the world. I hope that for all of those for whom the vaccine is available, that they choose to get vaccinated. Wear a mask, get vaccinated when you can, save a life.
0/0	I know this is a tough pill to swallow for a lot of people. But all you have to do is look at the outcomes in the highly vaccinated states and countries. Things there are as bad or worse than when there was no vaccines.
1/1	I know this isn‚Äôt the kind of thing anyone else will really care about but my 82 yo parents just got their first Covid vaccinations. Crying happy tears because maybe I can see them again one day
0/0	I know too many people who have had serious issues with the vaccine.
0/0	I know two Doctors, one is a consultant surgeon, and neither of them are taking the vaccine until they know the long term side effects which will take years.
0/0	I know two people who took the Moderna vaccine 2 weeks after their 2nd dose, they got blood clots and died
1/1	I know vaccines may be scary because they‚Äôre not perfect but they do work and help. I also agree about why its important and how it can affect those who can‚Äôt get vaccinated.
1/1	I know vaccines work
0/0	I know who have been vaccinated still ended up getting the virus in the months following second shot and boasters.
0/-1/0	I know why I'm not getting an untested " vaccine"...
0/0	I know you don't want to be candid with us, but can you please at least stop the censorship? We know people who have been fully vaccinated are contracting Covid 19 and being hospitalized. Why cant you just be honest with us? The Vaccines don't work as being promoted.
1/1	I know, it's sad that a child can't get vaccinated because they have an ignorant as a parent.
1/0	I learned as a child that it is always better to learn from others mistakes, than to make them yourself.
0/1	I learned as a child that it is always better to learn from others mistakes, than to make them yourself. So always remember those interviews from antivaxers in hospitals!
0/-1	I leave my vaccine to somebody that really needs it.
1/1	I legitimately cannot wait. Pump me up. Gimme one of each for all I care. I cannot go on day to day like this any more.
0/0	I like and love my immune system. My choice. My belief. No COVID19 vaccine. Period.
1/-1	I like how all these Armchair Doctors are angry in the comments.
0/0	I like how people defend a vaccine that has a high failure rate for a virus that has a near 100% survival rate because big pharma has bought a lot of ads and lobbied a bunch of politicians.
0	I like how they make the vaccine sound like it's good
0/0	I like how this video supposed to make you feel like it‚Äôs no big deal get the vaccine but I‚Äôm like I didn‚Äôt want it before and now I don‚Äôt want it even more.
1/0	I like how you explained the anti vax community is mainly responsible for most of the misinformation out there. We didnt pay attention to them before COVID but all of a sudden they‚Äôve managed to scare a lot of us into not getting vaccinated including myself. After this video my mind is clear and I‚Äôm getting vaccinated. Good luck to me!
1/1	I like how you think 3900000 deaths is absolutely nothing....Like mate come on! Even with 0.05% chance of death 3900000 people will die and HUMANITY says even a single death is a TRAGEDY. Unless your non human, You should probably go pro vaccine. Maybe better researched ones but still Pro vaccine
1/1	I like making fun of anti vaxxxers
0/0	I like my DNA the way it is THANK YOU
0/-1	I like that she is doing her own research and coming to her own conclusions. Following the crowd is not a choice for everyone. We all do what we believe is best for our body. That is the foundation of freedom of choice.
0/0	I like that you know the vaccine is poison!
0	I like the 4th one, I won't be bloody taking anything, who's gonna make money out of this
1/1	I like the idea of a new vaccine that actually works
0/0	I like the lady who said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not just going to get on a bandwagon like the rest and just get the vaccine‚Äù. I feel the same.
0/0	I like these odds. I refuse to be part of a massive test of unknown side affects of rushed vaccine. I will take my chances with my own immune system. My body, my choice.
1/1/1/1	I like this presentation. Thanks for sharing this. I got my first Moderna vaccine about 10 days ago. I experienced a sore arm and a minor rash. Looking forward to getting my second one.
1/1	I like this, except please take whichever vaccine is available. They are all good, not just the mRNA ones.
1/-1	I like to think about it this way: If you have serious reaction from the vaccine, imagine what it was like getting the real disease... If you have small to none side effects, then great!
0/1	I listen to facts and science...you go with yer feelings bud. Do you want me to send a nurse or doctor to tell you that most of the unvaccinated are in the ICU now?
1/-1	I listened to a news story on my computer, and they said that vaccines should last for years. I hope they are right as I am so big on prayers. I believe prayers really work a lot of times.
0/0	I literally cannot see any benefit in getting the vaccine. But I do see a whole lot of risks . They still can‚Äôt prove that it gives you ANY kind of immunity. They might as well be injecting you with water.
1/1/1/1	I literally cried when I got my vaccine from utter happiness.
1/1	I literally cried when my parents got their shots. I‚Äôd spent the entire pandemic worried about them and knowing they had another layer of protection that‚Äôs at a 90% plus level made covid seem a lot less scary.
1/1	I literally despise needles with my whole entire body and soul, but you know imma be the first to get that vaccine
1/1	I literally got the vaccine 3 days ago and felt nothing but a sore arm
1/1	I literally had a dream the other night that I got the vaccine. That‚Äôs it, that‚Äôs the entire dream. And it was great.
1	I literally just got my first shot of the vaccine today and my arm hurts like fuck but its Worth every SECOND of pain. Edit 1 month later...I got my booster had a week long reaction of feeling like shit still worth it
0/0	I literally just heard someone yesterday saying her whole family got vaccinated and they all got covid again. But yeah sure
0/0	I literally juts had the rona for 3 days it seriously was no big freaking deal. No jabbed and now have natural immunity
0/0	I literally would never put anything in my body that has the branding, ‚ÄòWarp Speed.‚Äô I would not drive a car branded ‚ÄòAssembled in 48 hours.‚Äô I wouldn‚Äôt hire an accountant branded ‚ÄòBorn yesterday.‚Äô
0/0	I live healthy and avoid commercialized medicine!
1/1	I live in Arizona. I got vaccinated yesterday morning. Very slight sore arm/not a big deal at all. I did get feverish for just a few minutes two or three times yesterday. Took ibuprofen before bed and slept great last night and feel 100% today. Still very slight soreness in my arm.
0/0	I live in Florida & the vaccine rollout has been absolute shit.
0/0/0/0	I live in Florida and if someone is walking up to my door and ready to stab me with a needle, this is a stand your ground state they better be wearing bulletproof vest
1/1	I live in India and I am visiting the US right now - getting my vaccine in Indiana tomorrow morning. I didn‚Äôt come here specifically for it but I‚Äôm super glad to be getting it as India is months behind.
1/1	I live in London, and I‚Äôm wondering where you got your figures. Probably Fox News. Anyway, according to the Office of National Statistics, ‚Äúin England, between 2 January and 2 July 2021, there were 51,281 deaths involving coronavirus (COVID-19); 640 occurred in people who were fully vaccinated, which includes people who had been infected before they were vaccinated. The risk of death involving COVID-19 was consistently lower for people who had received two vaccinations compared to one or no vaccination, as shown by the weekly age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) for deaths involving COVID-19.‚Äù
1/1	I live in NYC and got my second Moderna shot yesterday. I feel like dog shit, the aches and pains are no joke, but I'm so relieved that my immunocompromised fiancee is safer now that the people around her are vaccinated.
0/0	I live in Tennessee and haven't met a single person who has, has had, or knows anybody that has died from it. Seems to be a very illusive virus.
1/1	I live in a 4 gen. household & I‚Äôm w/students in person so I jumped on the #COVID19Vaccine as soon as I could. Getting vaccinated means I can better protect my family and school community from the daily risks we‚Äôre all living with.
1/1	I live in a massive anti-vaxx society. I want to get involved in the trials just so to be even more alien to said society.
1/1	I live in urban and accept the COVID-19 vaccination.
1/1	I long for a society where we can all at least agree that science is one of the most amazing and important achievements of humanity. It is literally the reason human beings live so long these days. Science and medicine progress has given us prolonged life!
0/0	I look forward to being part of a proud elite group of unvacinated in years to come. We shall look down with contempt on the mass herd of sheep who allowed themselves to be cowed and bullied into submission. We shall be the new upper class.
1/1	I look forward to getting my vaccination
1/1	I look forward to having a vaccine
1/1	I look forward to receiving my second shot in about a week and then enjoying the freedoms that those of us with vax passports will have, that the unvaccinated won't. Sucks for them
1/1	I look forward to seeing american covid cases plummet once we are all vaccinated.
0/0	I looked up the study and it only talks about whether or not you CAN get pregnant. It‚Äôs not a study on long-term health effects of children born to parents who got the vaccine. We haven‚Äôt even had enough time to study that. That‚Äôs my concern
0/0	I lost a female family relative recently. I think vaccine effects are more severe than the covid itself.
0/1	I lost a female family relative recently. I think vaccine effects are more than 1 in a million.
1/1	I lost a love one to covid so get vaccinated before you regret it
0/0	I lost my job a week ago because I chose to not get the vaccine.
0/0	I lost my love one after taking the vaccine. The choice is yours, don't regret it like me .
0/1	I lost so much respect for you. Mass vaccination is not necessary for a virus with a 0.02% IFR. Let those who want/need it take it and leave the rest of us alone!
1/1	I love GMOS and Vaccines
0/0/0	I love all the people who just can't wait to be the latest guinea pig for big pharma. Will sure be interesting to see the long-term side effects from these drugs. No thank you. I'll do a hard pass on this one
1/1	I love going through the comments. Whenever someone tries to debunk the myths the comment section is full of people saying "paid by big pharma". Its hilarious. Big pharma must have the worlds biggest payroll. It must be exhausting getting every doctor to keep their mouths shut about the great reset.
1/1	I love how a person outside the medical field is trying to say a person inside the medical field knows less. She's trying to show the world that the vaccines don't work before they came out and said the vaccines aren't going to protect you from covid
1/1/1/1	I love how everyone is so fixated on the long term effects of the vaccine, when they don't even consider the long term effects of being infected with covid.
1/1	I love how for 6 months peopla have been begging for a vaccine to be made and when one comes out they say it's "sus" and refuse to take it
1/-1	I love how people that aren‚Äôt doctors disagree with real doctors because they ‚Äúdid their own research.‚Äù
1/1	I love how people think it‚Äôs going to hurt them. Do these same people not realize the amount of toxic crap they put in and on their bodies each day, and here you have a centralized commitment by the global medical community to eradicate a sickness and people politicize it?
1/1	I love how people will do steroids , heroine, drugs, drink alcohol and eat junk food but won‚Äôt get the vaccine
1/1	I love how people will say don't take the vaccine because "I don't want to be 1 in a million." Then go on to defend that with "99% don't die from covid" yeah because 1 in 100-700 are much better odds.... dumb till the end.
0/0/0/0/0/0	I love how the intention of this video totally flipped on him. Just made me more sure not to vac.
0/0	I love how the pretence by sky news reporting this is to assume that the pharmaceutical companies are pure souls with no bad intentions, as if large deals worth billions of pounds that go into the pockets of their bosses have no bearing on their 'work' lol Don't worry friends, obviously its all for the greater good! whatever that means..
1/0	I love how the unhinged unvaxxed maga lunatics think the fact that vaxxed people can still catch and spread covid is a gotcha moment to the left. In reality it is just showing how stupid and ignorant the maga crowd really is.
0/0	I love how there‚Äôs an entire marketing campaign to ‚Äúother‚Äù people just for being skeptical and erring on the side of caution with their HEALTH. Ironic.
0/0	I love how they are talking as if 2 doses is ineffective without the booster. Glad I don't have to worry about whether I should get a 3rd dose or not since I don't have any doses!
1/-1	I love how they keep mentioning "the risks of vaccine side effects" just to keep the anti-vax people watching.
0/0	I love how they narrate it like they're talking to a fucking child. Piss off and take yr vaccine with you.
0/0	I love how they never ever advise people to strengthen their immune systems. Too cheap and easy?
0/0	I love how they say we need to get vaccines INTO people ...
1/0	I love how they say ‚Äújust look at vaccines like the chickenpox‚Äù. Yeah, but the big difference is time. The vaccines for polio and chickenpox have been around for a LONG time and we know what the short and long term side effects are. These new COVID vaccines have NOT been around a long time.
1/-1	I love how they're still debating the doctors to death
1/0	I love how well all know the vacciness don't keep you from getting or spreading the virus, but reduce the risk of hospitalization; all the while, still demanding that everybody get one to protect others
1/-1	I love how when you present scientific evidence, people still don‚Äôt believe you and say you‚Äôre being paid for this and/or pushing an agenda. Believe your conspiracy theories all you want... I‚Äôm going to choose to not live in fear
1/1/1/1	I love how when you present scientific evidence, people still don‚Äôt believe you and say you‚Äôre being paid for this and/or pushing an agenda. Believe your conspiracy theories all you want... I‚Äôm going to choose to not live in fear.
1/-1	I love how you guys worded the title to attract anti-vaxxers

1/1	I love it. Everyone must be vaccinated
1/1	I love me jabs... Keep em coming!

0/0	I love myself just fine not stick in my arm no COVID infection
1/1	I love needles.
1/1	I love pfizer
1/1	I love pfizer I will always love,an amazing company working day and night to serve humanity
1/1	I love seeing all of you get vaccinated! But don't post your vaccination cards on social media! Posting your vaccination card on social media could lead to a scam or even identify theft.
1/1	I love seeing more and more posts of folks getting their first shot. Gives the rest of us hope that we will be able to get one too. Thank you for taking care of us!!
1/-1	I love that 36% of respondents said they would be LESS inclined to get the vaccine if Trump says it‚Äôs safe
1/1	I love that they are all about medical freedom and choice, but when we choose to get our kids vaccinated they jump down our throats. But nothing can bring me down! My high risk 6 year old is booked for this weekend to get her first dose! üéâit will be a celebration!
0/0	I love the Trumps but an this vaccine stuff was a bad idea...i get why it was rushed out to push the lockdowns out but I have a bad feeling its gonna backfire long term
1/1	I love the benefit of them.
1/-1	I love the line "do some research". Firstly, if I'm debating with you, I likely have a basic idea what I'm talking about, it's silly to automatically assume you just know more than people on a subject. Secondly, you know who's probably done the most research? The actual experts. The scientists, the researchers...and they tend to overwhelmingly say the same thing.
1/1/1/1	I love the part where daughter defies her parents to get vaccinated. She‚Äôs taking her health serious; non like her folks. They‚Äôre prob out of shape and don‚Äôt take their health too serious. Great job girl.
1/0	I love the serendipity of the whole thing. It makes so much more sense than the clap trap I hear from the anti-vax crowd that come across as angry cavemen waving a club and eating raw meat.
0/0	I love the term "vaccine hesitancy" It's not hesitancy. It's just a big fat HELL NO!
0/0	I love the way that it states we all have responsibilities to others but forgets to include that big pharmaceuticals have completely side stepped that responsibility themselves so rush this through.
1/1	I love this ! I'm going now to get vaccinated
1/1/1/1	I love this ! I'm going now to get vaccinated thank you so much
0/0	I love this doctor for standing up and giving his professional and honest opinion. We need more like him. People deserve to hear both sides and be able to make up their own minds. The ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù should be a choice and only a choice.
1/1	I love this so much. Let's get that vaxxed rate up!!!!! Just drive around and shoot people with the COVID-19 vaccine ü§£
1/1	I love to get vaccinated. Makes me feel powerful.
1/1	I love you pfizer
1/1	I love you.....you have giving me and my loved ones a new lease on life thank you to you and all your colleagues.....Pfizer Rocks...!!
0/0	I love your show and family but I will not get the vaccine. No long term effects done. Scientists don't even know if it's one and done, yearly boosters needed, nothing. Look what thalidomide did to babies in the 60's.
1/1	I loved this video. It seems like those unvaccinated people are causing lots of issues for the world when it comes to covid. People that can get vaccinated should, but then it‚Äôs their body and their choice. All this research with vaccines is really truly incredible and it seems that one day such diseases may not really hurt as much in the future.
1/1	I m all for vaccine use (already had my first shot) but I agree that nobody should be forced to take it. Encouraged, even incentivized, sure; forced no.
1/1	I m all in favor of the vaccine, Trump said Thursday. It s one of the great achievements, a true miracle, and not only for the United States. We re saving tens of millions of lives throughout the world. We re saving entire countries. The vaccine is a great thing and people should take advantage of it Trump said, before quickly adding that nobody should be forced, we have our freedoms. But I strongly recommend it because it s a real lifesaver.
1/0	I m fine with a vaccine as long as they don t force it on people. I personally don t want it either. But it should be available for anyone who does want to get it.
1/1	I m have 2 doses of Pfizer no booster and have been exposed maskless getting the text message 5 times. I tested negative 5 times. Getting the booster in a week, I think the vaccine works. May not prevent you from getting it but clearly reduces the chances or symptoms. I do wash my hands every time I touch a door so there is also that.
0/0	I made apt for Pfizer vaccine and CANCELLED IT! Why ? I walked in to work a coworkers best friend died right after their second dose !!! I said hell no !
1/1	I made my appointment in advance waiting for high risk health issues to be eligible in my state and have been so eager to get it and protect myself
1/1	I made the choice to get the COVID-19 vaccine because it's safe, it's effective, and because I want to protect my family and my community. That way, all of us together, can finally stop COVID-19, get our country back together and back to work.
0/0	I may be furry and fat but I‚Äôm not your jab lab rat!
1/1	I mean 2.97M is a lot of dead people. I can't imagine how many more would've died if we never shut down and created restrictions. And even if you don't die, having Covid isn't very fun so you should probably get a vaccine anyway.
1/1	I mean I've tried to sign up for almost every trial, so you could say I'm a bit impatient.
1	I mean if you want covid that‚Äôs cool.
1/-1	I mean is there anyone who is not sceptical about this vaccine? I will definetly get the vaccine but I would rather wait a few weeks before it gets public.
0/0	I mean isn‚Äôt it obvious why they are rushing it so much instead of the old way by us recovering by waiting until the COVID is gone?
1	I mean it is even free so why would you not take it?
0/0	I mean it is insufficient. It was a rushed vaccine under the Trump administration. You can't just make a vaccine kick out fast without cutting corners.
1/1/1/1	I mean it's the same with any vaccine so I'll take it right away
0/0	I mean most side effects are mild, the ones that aren‚Äôt are death by heart attack but it‚Äôs probably worth a gamble so you don‚Äôt get a snotty nose for a couple of days right?
1/1/1	I mean talking about side effects just look at the ones for paracetamol which is effectively used in most of the world as far as I know
1/1	I mean the USA population is around 320 million people, so if we multiply 320 million by .03 (survival rate) that's 9.2 million people who would die if we did nothing. Glad people are ok with literally millions of people dying.
1/1	I mean while I agree in getting the vaccine I don't agree with mandates. I found it funny how he tried to tell the lady oh ya get the vaccine so we can squash COVID. No that's not how this works. It won't squash it. It'll just reduce risk to the higher risk.
1/1/1	I mean, I'm certainly going to want the vaccine, I just might want to be part of the second batch, just to be sure it's safe.
1/1	I mean, good? Better than the bin - the more people vaccinated, the better for everyone.
0/0	I mean, the Aluminium3+ ion is used in vaccines. Though, several studies has shown it to have direct connection to alzheimers, diabetes athritis and so many more chronic diseases. Look it up.
1/1	I mean... I've had several shots and all my vaccines. and I'm still alive and healthy and living my best life..
1/1/1	I met an anti-vac kid who was also living the diet life of organic, gluten-free, etc all per the parent... kid looked sick as hell.... HOW IS THIS NOT CHILD NEGLECT?!?!?!
1/1	I met several health care workers in a CoViD_19 hospital, who refused vaccination ,citing reason that( Covishield) vaccine contains RNA! Neither RNA nor non- RNA vaccines are harmful .The eradication of Smallpox and Polio happened due to vaccines .
0/-1	I might consider it ten years from now
1/1/0/1	I might take the vaccine after maybe a year to see how people react. I just don't understand the vaccine panic and people sitting in lines for hours waiting for it which may put them at greater risk. If people relax and wait till it's all widely available things will go more smoothly.
0/0	I might trust the long term studies when they come out in a decade or so.
0/0	I miscarried after Astra Zeneca. If someone wants to explain to me how they are 100% sure that didn‚Äôt cause that I‚Äôm listening.
1/1	I miss the days when a vaccine was considered a miracle.
1/1	I miss when i would ride my bike outside for fun and shit was simpler, get your vaxx
1/1	I missed my life,get me the vaccine as fast as possible
0/0	I more scared about the vaccine then about the virus
1/1/1/1	I must admit that I don‚Äôt believe anything the media says anymore. Despite that, I hope the vaccines work.
1/1	I must say, most of the replies to this are uplifting. Being one of the early cases, left with severe respiratory damage from it, I hope this effort prevents a lot of people from having to suffer what I have.
1/1	I myself received Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine recently. The only side effect was a sore arm. Everyone with access to a COVID-19 vaccine should take it. And the world should help Africa secure a steady supply, where virus mortality rates have shown a concerning rise.
0/0	I need additional information about the vaccine.
1/1	I need covid shot, where I live I can't get one
1/1	I need covid shot, where I live I can't get one, I'm old and at high risk.

1/1	I need that now. Guinea pig on deck !!
1/1	I need this translated in spanish, wish I could confidently explain like the guys in the videos why it is important to be vaccinated, but I'm not and people in latin america are too superstitious when accepting something that will help them but they do not understand. Well that last part maybe its a global issue
1/1	I need to get this vaccine so that I can safely take a trip somewhere because every day I feel like I am closer to losing it
1/1	I need to get vaccine, so that I can get entry approval for Singapore. Please help me with this. I have been married for 1 year and unable to meet my husband, as my entry approval is rejected each time. Vaccine can help my chances for approval. Please help!

1/1	I needed to watch this video... I was hesitant about the vaccine at first but now that Dr. Seema explained it so well I will definitely be getting it. I think I just needed someone to tell me that I am overthinking it and she definitely got my head straight
0/0	I never HAD the covid never will so I‚Äôm not keen on getting it
1/1	I never considered not having the vaccine. In fact, I was looking forward to having it, I wanted to have it done. I‚Äôm anxious to get back to normal life as soon as possible.
0/1	I never even thought about hesitating! My husband and I knew it was the right thing to do for us! We have gotten both!
0/0	I never expected people to sleep on ALL those harmful effects from the so-called vaccines like it's nothing. I am so disappointed‚Ä¶
0/0	I never get a flu shot, why would I get one for this?

0/0	I never got it and I never will. Nothing they say or do will change my mind on that deadly "vaccine"
0/0	I never got sick. Why would I even think about taking a vaccine?
1/1	I never had any problems on all 3 times I was vaccinated. Just like flu shot. Have a wonderful evening and get vaccinated!
1/1	I never had any side affects from eigther one of my covid shots it was Pfizer is this good or bad that I never had any side affects I might had a sore arm from the 2nd one
0/0	I never had such a good reason to examine "vaccine medicine" until now. As I research more and more deeply, these words beg to be spoken: What a scam, a harmful mass scam.
0/0	I never heard a single report about blood clotting from Covid-19 before these medicines were given. Now we're expected to believe the manufacturer that the virus can do it and not the medicine. Riiight...
0/0	I never taking it

0/0	I not get vaccin I am vegan stay safe keep wear mask it not over yet.
0/0	I not taking vaccines during COVID-19
1/-1	I noticed that most of the people that are against this cannot spell or use proper grammar.
1/-1	I once almost chocked on food. Food nearly killed me. Therefore, I chose not to feed myself or my kids. Some may say that eating food supposedly ‚Äúprevents starvation‚Äù but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to ignore the risk. Choking. Bad taste. Food allergies. And so many other risks, that are so much worse than not eating food. If you choose to feed your kids potentially deadly food, that‚Äôs on you. But based on my 2 minutes of internet research, I will protect my kids, and not feed them. Anti vaxxers in a nutshell
1/1	I once dreamt that i have worms for fingers Now I'm anti sleep WAKE UP!!! (pun intended)

1/1	I overheard a conversation at Barry island today between two elderly people, commenting how brilliant their experience at West quay medical was at the Saturday vaccination clinic...." So efficient....straight in and out we were".
1/1	I overheard a guy at work say he won't get that government poison shot while smoking a cigarette.
0/0	I own a business, and meet hundreds of people every week. Still waiting to meet someone who actually had bad symptoms from COVID. Haven't met one yet. I've met a LOT of people who have had negative side effects form the vaccine, though.
0/0	I passed on the vaccine would rather take my chances on my natural immune system given to me by God.
0/0	I person i know died 6 days after getting the second does of a massive heart attack.He was 83 .Glad iam not taking it right now!
0/0	I personally am never getting the shot
1/1	I personally believe it‚Äôs my duty to get vaccinated to keep patients and my colleagues safe.
1/1	I personally chose to get the vaccine because this virus has killed younger people in great health like myself and I really don't want to take that risk or worry every time I go to the store about catching it.
0/0	I personally do not understand why anyone would get it but I‚Äôm not going to shit on people for getting it. Pro-covid vaccine people on the other hand will attempt to socially shame you into compliance.
0/0	I personally do not understand why anyone would get it but I‚Äôm not going to shit on people for getting it. Pro-covid vaccine people on the other hand will attempt to socially shame you into compliance. Want to get it? Go for it, it‚Äôs your choice. Leave me the fuck alone though.
0/-1	I personally do not want either of the shots however if it becomes necessary to work or travel I will get it. My choice. I had Covid already thoough.
1/-1	I personally don't expect COVID-19 to go away, I think it will just become the new seasonal flu for which you have to get vaccinated anually.
0/0	I personally don't trust the vax, nor have I ever trusted corporate media and the government.
0/0	I personally don‚Äôt trust it because we will never know what will happen 5 years into the future. It could start another sickness, kill some people, have no effect at all in the future protect us in the future, we don‚Äôt really know. This goes for all medicine and vaccines not just the COVID-19 vaccine. But since it is fairly new I want to wait it out just to be safe, you know?
1/1	I personally haven‚Äôt had any bad side effects of getting vaccines, so I don‚Äôt have any idea on the bad side of vaccines. I‚Äôm not saying that vaccines are 100% safe. I‚Äôm just saying that getting a vaccine is better than getting a deadly disease
1/1	I personally just got over having Covid and have pretty bad asthma and I am so thankful that I had the vaccine because I know it would‚Äôve been much more serious if I didn‚Äôt. I still had terrible effects and I‚Äôm still dealing with the aftermath but I know if I didn‚Äôt have the vaccine it would‚Äôve been even worse.
0	I personally know a person that was fully "vaccinated" and still got Covid-19, and nearly died twice in the hospital.
0/0	I personally know two people so far with crippling side affects from the vaccine after taking the second shot. I don't know which vaccine either of them had but both are now having to use a walker to get around. The vaccine wasn't tested long enough.
0/0	I personally know two people that had serious side effects after the second Jab. That's enough doing my own studies. One got a lung blood clot That was resolved with medicine thanks God. Both are still alive
1/1	I personally want to give a huge shout out to all the scientists, lab tech's and health care workers that have made this happen in less than a year.
0/0	I personally will not get the COVID vaccine
0/0	I personally will not risk and wait for the situation to develop, and in any compulsion, I will firmly say that I am afraid and in such a situation I do not have - unless by force of the right to force me to vaccinate
0/0	I personally will wait to get the vaccine. I don‚Äôt see why it should be mandatory, as in theory, if other people have the vaccine, they should be safe from me, no? They will have immunity from the virus, and so it can be a person choice for my body wether or not I am willing to risk getting the virus.
0/0	I personally won't get it right now. Its too new and I want to see how it goes before I decide, I think that's reasonable

0/0	I planned to get vaccine if US reached 1000 like Bulgaria on that chart but it won't so I won't!I go by the stats!I feel a sense of conspiracy because the primary non incidental hospitalizations for COVID are much much lower than official graph numbers üö®That's a conspiracy feel üö®

1/-1	I really don't get the people who are like "Who'd pay $1000 for a vaccine?" We are all paying vastly more than that for the lockdown? Obviously? I can only model this as "neurotypical doesn't money", which I worry is not a very empathetic or predictive model.
0/0	I really don't understand because people will still put on masks and social distance. I don't think if it Will help us

0/0	I really dont trust these people enough to get something like this from them if they are pushing this and making it free and it messes with your DNA in some way you got to be dumb if you take this.

0/0	I really don‚Äôt understand how the vaccine would be if any benefit for the very frail. I‚Äôve worked with hospice patients for 10 years and I didn‚Äôt even recommend the flu vaccine.
1/1	I really fucking hate that we have to waste resources on studies that are 100% unnecessary just because some people came up with an excuse to not get the jab. And then the icing on the shit cake is it won't change their minds anyway, they'll just find something else.
1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1	I really happy that vaccine will be made from COVID-19 i hope it come out soon because i really wanna for people‚Äôs life‚Äôs be saved from covid
1/1	I really hate how antivaxxers use autism as a fear mongering thing. especially since I'm autistic myself. it sucks to have a group of people use the way I naturally am as a "bad side effect", something that you don't want and should avoid. like, gee thanks, I love having the way I naturally am used as a fear tactic and portrayed as a malevolent disease /s
0	I really hope for the best that are getting 3 or 4 doses both mentally and physically. Especially for the children that don‚Äôt have a choice
1/1	I really hope that the COVID vaccine rollout helps illuminate just how ridiculous the anti-vaccine movement is to the point where it just sort of fades away into nothingness
0/-1	I really hope the death rate will start hitting a ceiling from end of January, with a much lower ceiling by March / April. If they throw Moderna and AZ/Oxford into the mix, they could accelerate the progress.
1/1	I really hope the mRNA vaccine scientists win the Nobel Prize. Never has a vaccine with such high efficacy been created so fast using RNA.
1/1	I really hope this vaccine keeps all from catching this terrible virus
1/1	I really love vaccines, especcialy now with covid
1/0	I really think that people should stop scare postings over the Vaccines...its frightening enough the whole situation without speculating and causing more angst
1/1	I really want the mRNA vaccines, although I'll take what I get. These sorts of vaccines from everything I've heard are revolutionary and may be the stepping stone to eliminating all sorts of ailments. NOVA had a show which talked about them very recently, and it's encouraging to say the least. Can we imagine a world where the flu is eliminated? Where, maybe, some cancers can be prevented? It's a brave new frontier for medicine, and I am hoping in our lifetimes we can see these vile diseases curtailed.
1/0/1	I really want to receive the Pfizer vaccine.
0/0	I really want to think there‚Äôs nothing wrong with the vaccine, I just can‚Äôt get there
1/1	I really wish my mom would vaccinate me; I'm okay for now, but I'm worried I'll get really sick one day.
1/-1	I really wish there were more informative articles like this in order to fight with facts against all that misinformation that has invaded the Internet and Social Networks.
0/0	I received 1shot & 2 shout of Moderna. No reaction from #1. #2 was a very bad reaction. Very dizzy, walking like a drunk, lasted 4+ weeks. I still have bad days after 6 weeks.
1/1	I received 2 injections 28 days apart. I chose to volunteer and participate in the Moderna Clinical trial because I want to help get the vaccine out so we can go back to our lives.
1/1	I received Moderna, my son and Mom who is 80 both had the 2 shots of Pfizer, no problems, I get my 2nd shot Thursday
0/0	I received an email from a doctor that there were many poisons in these vaccines
1/1/1	I received my 1st Moderna dose 2 days ago. The shot itself was very typical, similar to the flu or pneumonia. Not painful at all. But it is a needle in the muscle, so obviously my arm was sore that night & the next day, but by today has subsided to a minimal ache. I suggest getting it in your dominant arm, relaxing your body & exhaling right before injection & moving the arm around after. As for side effects? About 2 hours later, I became very sleepy & napped for 2-3 hrs. It made my body feel tired as well, but not in an unpleasant, sick fatigue way, but rather, the feeling your body gets after an intense workout or how you feel after taking a bunch of cold meds. Like tingly jello muscles. Don't be afraid. In total honesty, I felt worse after my flu & pneumonia vaccines. This one was much more tolerable. I know everyone is different but bottom line, if you can handle a flu shot, you can handle this.
1/1	I received my 2nd dose in April...no adverse reaction...no Covid-19. I understand that there will be those who are harmed by the effects of the vaccine. It's also clear that without the ability to immunize populations against contagious diseases, the tragedy increases exponentially.
1/1	I received my 2nd dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine yesterday (2/11) and the decision to get the vaccine was a no brainer. A great deal of the hesitation or concern that some people have about getting the vaccine is due to a lack of understanding and/or bad information spreading through the net.
1/1	I received my 2nd dose this week. I‚Äôm so thankful and looking forward ahead.
1/0	I received my COVID 19 vaccine I have gotten 3 different types of cancer but otherwise feeling fine
1/1	I received my J&J vaccination over a month ago. No issues. Just a little soreness in the arm for 2 days (lifting weights the next day). Same with multiple people who I know. Here we go again with the fearmongering.
1	I received my Pfizer #1 yesterday and I saw hundreds of happy people including myself. The clinic was run smoothly and professionally. Great job to the gang at Mid-Hudson Regional Hospital !!
1/1	I received my covid vaccine today! They are braving the cold & it went smoother than a chic-fil-a drive through. I‚Äôm so grateful to put covid behind me!
1/1	I received my first COVID-19 vaccine today. #COVID19 #WVStrong #MaskUpWV
1/1/1/1	I received my first Moderna vaccine yesterday. 19 hours later, I'm happy to report no problems.
1/1	I received my first Pfizer shot about 60 hours ago. NO fever; NO headache, NO lethargy.
1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1	I received my first Pfizer shot about 60 hours ago. NO fever; NO headache, NO lethargy. The injection site in my arm began to hurt about 6 hours after I had the shot. The pain was manageable without ibuprofen or aspirin. By the second day the pain began to fade and late in the afternoon it just disappeared. I worked out today and feel fine. From what I've read the second shot probably won't go as easily. However, at 70 years old I figure the reward far outweighs the risk.
1/1	I received my first dose and I'm a mother of a disabled, medically complex child. We have to do everything we can to protect our kids from this virus!
1/1	I received my first dose of the #CovidVaccine 24 hours ago @uihealthcare. It was a happy day, a triumph of science. It was also a sad day as hundreds of thousands of people around the globe are still getting infected every day.
1/1	I received my first dose of the Moderna Covid vaccine this afternoon. So far so good, zero side effects.
1/1	I received my first dose of the Pfizer about an hour ago and so far so good.
1/1/1/1	I received my first if two COVID-19 vaccines today. I was incredibly impressed with the efficient operation. Great job Howard County Health Dept!
1/1	I received my first one already (healthcare). Can't wait to get the second and be doing my part to get out of this mess. Yes, new vaccines are scary. The unpredictability of COVID and this crazy world we are living in seem even scarier to me.
1/1	I received my first shot about 3 weeks ago and will be going for the second soon. I had a mild reaction from the first one I got a headache and felt extreme fatigue the symptoms cleared up in 24 hours..my boss had both dose she did not react from the first one at all but the second one she had a reaction.. she had extreme fatigue, headache, joint pan, but in about 24 hours symptoms cleared up.. I would rather deal with the symptoms from the vaccine then the symptoms from the virus.. stay safe everyone..√∞≈∏‚Ñ¢¬è
1/1	I received my first shot of Moderna about 2 weeks ago. Had a stiffness in my arm for about 3-4 days and on the 5th day I felt absolutely no side effects.
1/1	I received my first vaccine today
1/1/1/1/1/1/1	I received my first vaccine today :)
1/1/1/1	I received my moderna vaccine 1 week ago, so far so good

1/1	I received my second dose yesterday! Can't wait till everyone can get it.
1/1	I received my second vaccine üíâ on Monday and I feel so comfortably Numb I wish I could get a third one, if for any reason I happen to croak someone please let me know ü•Äü•Äüßü
1/1	I received my shingles shot in November and had the same side affects as he described, had the 2nd shot 2 months later and the same miserable side affects twice. but it was worth it not to get shingles. most vaccines have reactions .
1/1	I received my vaccine today. I would simply like to thank you for this channel and it's fact and evidence based content during this past year. It has been a wonderfully insightful place to turn to and I am sure contributed to my mental well being. thank you.
1/1	I received the Astra Zenica vaccine a month ago at a pharmacy. No problems. I am looking forward to the second dose.
1/1	I received the Moderna vaccine 3 days ago. I feel fine so far
1/1/1/1	I received the Moderna vaccine 3 days ago. I feel fine so far.
1/1	I received the Pfizer vaccine today. I work at a post office and at least 10 of my customers are no longer alive due to Covid-19. One death is too many. One case is too many. I love my neighbors and customers as myself and will do all I can to protect them and keep them safe.
1/1	I received the Pfizer vaccine today. Thank you for your helpful info!
1/1	I received the first dose of the vaccine and thanks to this video I now have a better understanding of why and how the vaccine works.
1	I received the first vaccination of the Moderna vaccine this morning and I had heat flashes and sweating after 10 minutes but it went away really fast and I was back to normal.
1/1	I received the vaccine and didn't have any of these issues. Its ridiculous that these problems are even coming up for people.
1/1	I received the vaccine and no problems here thankfully.
1/1	I recently got my second dose of Pfizer. Didn‚Äôt hurt as much as the first. I don‚Äôt exactly feel completely invincible but damn does it help.
1/1	I recently received the vaccine and I could not be more grateful to the scientists who developed it and the brave volunteers. Truly awe-inspiring. I TRUST SCIENCE.
1/1	I recieved a phone call from my GPs practice on the 6th Jan informing me that I was to receive my vaccination on the 8th Jan. Brilliant so efficient the practice was so well laid out with Marshall to assist one to enter and a well distanced area to wait the 15min after the vaccination. Great service by fantastic caring people. Thank you NHS
1/1	I recieved my first dose of the pfizer yesterday. Has anyone experienced back pain afterwards?
1/1	I recieved the vaccine 1st dose this past friday and I feel absolutely fine my arm was a lil sore.
1/1	I recieved the vaccine moderna. As a nurse who works with the elderly at the VA, I dont want to pass anything on to them. I am also a brittle diabetic & It didn't effect my blood sugar levels (that was suprising). I was not feeling well for a few days, Exactly the way my body responds to the flu shot. The injection didn't even hurt.
1/1	I reckon the vaccine is safer than those pills people were/are popping in Ibiza though. Doesn't stop them popping them though. ;-)
0/0	I recomend you look at the numbers in the uk of deaths from covid after vaccination, from start feb, to aug 8th 2021 the deaths of people vaccinated outnumber those not!!!! DONT BELIEVE ME LOOK YOURSELF
0/0	I recommend cough medicine. It works better.
0/0	I recommend everybody here to put this in a search engine: "america's frontline doctors position paper on covid-19 experimental vaccins" They will tell you why you should not take this vaccin. Click on the link to get the PDF.
0/0	I recommend never take vaccine.
1/-1	I recommend the Oxford jab personally. As acedemics here will live and die by that method. The issue being Security services are rife within that sector. As in Oxford is mi5 and mi6 recruitment and training territory. Other than that, I would look at evidence and make your own choice. The Pfizer vaccine is filthy trash, stay away.
1/1	I recommend you all to get your shots!
1	I recommend you make a video especially about the corona vaccine because you have a wide audience that trusts and believes in you and it can help us all
0/0	I refuse it. They want to kill us. #NoToVaccine
0/0/0/-1	I refuse out of spite and spite alone. I believe, at worst, it‚Äôs non-effective but I still will refuse simply out of spite.
0/0	I refuse that so called vaccine. Can't make me get it either. I like living too much!
0/0	I refuse the jab test and mask
0/0	I refuse to be a science project!
0/0	I refuse to be forced by our government to get a vaccine until I know more about it, the side effects, etc. I seriously doubt there has been enough research done on this. I‚Äôm not going to be a guinea pig.
0/0	I refuse to get a third shot. After the second one I was so sick there is no way I would get another one. I wish I never got the shot to begin with!
0/0	I refuse to get any vaccine
0/0	I refuse to get any vaccine that's this new
0/0	I refuse to get jabbed, and threatening me over my job won't help you!

0/0	I refuse to get the shot. My body my choice
0/0	I refuse to get the vaccine
0/0	I refuse to get the vaccine, bc I think that China created the virus as a biochemical weapon to destroy the world & then to control the world.
1/1	I refuse to hang out with anyone who isn't vaccinated but to be fair im always alone so...
0/0	I refuse to have any vaccine ... we don‚Äôt know what is in them
0/0	I refuse to live in fear and follow all of these stupid suggestions when the virus has a 99.9% survival rate and will barely be worse than having cold symptoms for 95% of the people that get infected. Enough is enough.
0/0	I refuse to put this garbage into my bloodstream. NOW WHAT?
0/0	I refuse to take any of the vaccines Pfizer or AstraZeneca. They are meant to kill us
0/0	I refuse to take covid vaccine my brother told me his friend have muscle aches and fever I‚Äôll not take covid vaccine My body My choice not your business
0/0	I refuse to take it
0/0	I refuse to take it until it has been distributed to millions of citizens over a period of several months across geographies and demographics, and it has been verified outside the laboratory as safe and effective.
0/0	I refuse to take that shit! There is no guarantee that all these vaccines are safe considering the people who died from them . Taking this vaccine is like committing a suicide...
0/0	I refuse to take the vaccine
0/0/0/0/0/0	I refuse!!
0/0	I refuse, refuse, refuse to take this vaccine! I will continue to rely on my God-given immune system, which hasn‚Äôt failed me yet!!
0/0	I refused it. my friends who are also pregnant did the same.
1/1	I refused the vaccine due to potential health risks, however i've changed my mind after *actually* trying to understand the comparative risks of covid. So i admit to getting that wrong - partly out of anxiety, primarily out of laziness. I had my first vaccination last week.
0/0	I regard any attempt to force this vaccine on me as an assault and I would use any means available to defend myself.
0/1	I regret getting the Pfizer vaccine. I now have shingles. Related to the vaccine? I don‚Äôt know and that‚Äôs scary.
0/0	I regret taking this vaccine
0/0	I rely on my immune system and not injecting some crap into my body.
0/0	I remember a time when parents would tell their kids, ‚ÄúJust SAY NO to Drugs!‚Äù
0/0	I remember about that HPV vaccine that caused terrible (permanent) side effects to some girls. I will give it some time before I'll take this one.
1/1/1/1	I remember being amazed when the COVID-19 vaccine was made so quickly, and after watching this, I am even more amazed by how revolutionary this new way of making vaccines is. An applause to everybody who contributed in making and giving out these wonderful stuff. And thank you for the good video.
0/0	I remember getting the flu shot one year, and it made my arm sore temporarily and I didn't like that. So the next year, I decided to see if I could go without and see if I got sick or not that year. Well, I didn't get sick. I'm someone who doesn't really get sick especially when I take vitamins like ester-C. I actually take a whole lot of other things in addition to that, and the covid-19 virus hasn't gotten me sick yet despite being usually out 6 days of the week, so my thinking is that I don't need the vaccine to stay well, and I have a Facebook friend that has

1/1	I remember going to get the polio vaccine when I was a kid. My ex husband had polio. He got it when he was 5 years old. He spent 1 year in an iron lung. His age, just missed getting vaccinated. Forever changed his life. Vaccinations can save lives. Plus, help keep the economy improving.
0/0	I remember having to get the chicken pox vaccine in the 10th grade. The next year I was out of school for a month with the chicken pox. I'm not in a hurry to get the covid vaccine.
1/1	I remember my science teacher used to wear a shirt that said: Got Polio? Me neither. Thanks science!
1/1/1	I remember some weeks ago someone claim that Germany could not ever manage to vaccinate more than 300K per day. So glad it‚Äôs not true.
0/-1	I remember there was some dismissed rumblings about bits of HIV being used in the #CovidVaccine, and now there's suddenly new HIV variants and people testing positive for HIV in increasing numbers? Hmmm... Maybe yet another conspiracy theory becoming conspiracy fact?
1/1	I remember when I had to travel to Asia -- I was grateful to be vaccinated against these insidious diseases.
0/0	I remember why I don't watch sky news now. I had covid in April 2020 and have not been reinfected even with my son having covid recently. I am unvaccinated so natural immunity works even almost 2 years later and with the latest variants. I respect Dr James for speaking out the truth.
1/1	I remind people who (still) think that the vaccine is magnetic, that it is connected to 5G, that it is a global plot to control the population or to kill us all, etc. that Drogue Info Service is open free of charge on 0800 23 13 13, 7 days a week from 8am to 2am
1/1	I request every individual to take vaccine and cooperate with our Government measures and follow it properly so that we all can defeat this kind of virus easily.We have to think about the front line workers as well and pray for everyone guiding and protecting us
0/0	I respect everybody‚Äôs opinion but ill pass on that vaccine thank you üíØ
0/1	I risked to remain semi paralyzed after the first shot of Pfizer.
1/1	I rlly do suggest taking it, I am fully vaccinated and will receive a booster sometime in the future.
0/0	I run 2 very large pharmaceutical injury groups and many have buried people because of vaccines. I won‚Äôt be getting any vaccines ever again
1/1	I run several companies and all my employee will be vaccinated, everybody should get the vaccine, see yaa!
1/1	I said No Way at first but after doing some reading and listening to experts in the medical and science community I decided to get the vaccine.
1/1	I said No Way at first but after doing some reading and listening to experts in the medical and science community I decided to get the vaccine. I get my first shot tomorrow! I‚Äôm ready!
0/0	I said it when they first started telling folks to get these vaccine that I could see the writing on the wall. ‚ÄúIf you have taken this vaccines you may be entitled to compensation‚ÄùRemember folks, NONE, I repeat, none of them are approved by the FDA.
0/0	I said the vaccines don‚Äôt work. There were more COVID DEATHS IN 2021 than all of 2020.
0/0	I said this months ago whoever puts that stuff into you the day get them to countersign it because nobody will be held accountable if things go wrong
0/1	I saw a post where a pregnant healthcare worker got the vaccine, then about a week-ish later posted that she had miscarried. It could've just been a horrible coincidence, because she was still kind of early in the pregnancy, but pregnant or nursing women aren't supposed to get the vaccine yet.
1/1	I saw with my own eyes how well the vaccine protected my older two children and how my youngest struggled with COVID and still has lingering fatigue.
0/0	I say be patient and allow sufficient time to research the hell out of Covid-19 vaccines because the long term side effects are still unknown. I am not even hopeful that science will ever beat a coronavirus
0/0	I say be patient and allow sufficient time to research the hell out of Covid-19 vaccines because the long term side effects are still unknown. I am not even hopeful that science will ever beat a coronavirus. Sars-Cov2 seems to be exposing the arrogance within the scientific community.
0/0	I say no. If they can't answer questions about it, no, we should not take it.
0/0	I say: ‚Äúmy body, my choice‚Äù
1/1	I scheduled my vaccine after watching this video...Thank you for explaining everything so well.
1/1	I see a lot of angry people in the comments and I get it, vaccine hesitancy is a real problem. I just think that a good way to combat that is by being transparent, and cautious. Personally while it's a tiny amount of people, I think it's a good thing to investigate
1/1	I see from your bio that you are a runner. Are you happy on taking the chance to 'survive' but never run again because you lungs are shot to bits as a consequence of long COVID? The vaccine also reduces severity of COVID among those who do not develope full immunity.
1/1	I see how you can be nervous, but you need to trust it. We have passed mass human trials, it is safe.
0/1	I see myself as being at little risk of getting a case of COVID-19.
1/0	I see people saying covid vaccine is different but not giving any reasoning other than the rare vague statement that it is untested. What is the actual argument? You can't change someone's mind with vagueries
1/1	I see so many people dismissing this virus, and that makes me sad - thank you to these amazing scientists. Covid is really quite horrific and I don‚Äôt even know what kind of internal damage has been done to me. One thing is for sure - I‚Äôd gladly have the vaccine right now if I could because my biggest immediate fear is getting this virus again.
1/-1	I see so many people scared to take a vaccine because they are worried it contains some kind of chip or worse
1/1	I see so many unvaccinated antenatal clients and mothers of newborns one into my workplace. It‚Äôs sad, the misinformation/ fear campaign has really gotten to them.
0/0	I see that ethics and morals is no longer applicable in medicine, it's become corrupt with profit.
1/1	I see the COVID-19 vaccine as a very much necessary precaution and it's important to get it so we as a society can build up a sort of herd immunity to the virus
1/1	I see the COVID-19 vaccines as a medical miracle‚Äî for myself and my family.
0/0	I see the good doctor is spreading misinfo, the Mrna injections don't stop transmission or contraction of C19 so why the mandates ?
1/1	I see too many anti-vax things from friends, so as a concerned mom every now and then I need to rewatch this video to remind myself to ignore them. I love this video!
1/1/1/1/1/1/1	I see vaccines like seatbelts. If you're in a serious car accident and are wearing a seatbelt it isnt 100% guaranteed you're going to survive. But you have a higher chance of surviving by wearing a seatbelt then those who choose not to wear a seatbelt and get into a car accident.
0/0/0/0/0/0/-1	I see why people don't want to get the vaccine, they simply don't trust the people saying it's safe.
0/0	I seem to be triggering a lot of people by saying that the COViD vaccines are ‚Äúuntested‚Äù... Another truth that is hurting...
0/0	I seen a guys mother get convulsions and siesures after taking the Pfhizer shot. It was very disturbing.
0/0	I sent my 77 year old father to the hospital by ambulance last night 3 days after getting the first dose of the pfizer vaccine. His left arm was sore he was hallucinating seeing and talking to people that were not there had the chills dizziness vomiting. This is why you dont rush vaccines!
1/1	I serach this video : importance of vaccination in this lockdown (covide-19)
1/-1	I seriously hope it gets to the point where you can‚Äôt do certain things, like fly, unless you show proof of vaccination.
1	I seriously want my vaccine. I'm 47. Can all older people go and get there now so we younger people can have appointments soon ?!
0/0	I shall not be rushing off to have any of these novel mRNA vaccines which have no proven efficacy or beneficial health outcomes since there is no clear evidence in the medical literature. Instead I am having my immune status measured by a private appointment with a Consultant in immunology and respiratory disease. So far I have not had Flu or Covid-19 and I am 90!
0/1	I should hope all the negative commentators are not anti maskers!!! We are about to enter our ( third )lock down here in Ontario, can? get enough vaccines
1/1	I should shortly be offered a vaccine but may get a choice if I wait longer but now feel reassured that all the vaccines are effective.
1/1	I shoulda got the vaccine when I had the chance. I was being too skeptical
1/1	I signed up for a vaccine in January. Still waiting for my first shot. I was diagnosed with COVID-19 this week. I wish I could have got my shot before this.
1/1	I signed up for the vaccine as soon as I was eligible, my second shot isn't until the 20th. Sucks that they couldn't just wait until everybody who wanted the vaccine had a chance to get it.
1/1	I signed up to be put on the list I‚Äôm Nervous but it took a a lot for me to do this I‚Äôm proud of myself
1/1	I signed up to be put on the list I‚ÄômNervous but it took a a lot for me to do this I‚Äôm proud of myself
1/1	I signed up today to get a vaccine ASAP.
0/0/0	I simply do not trust the government what so ever. The government doesn‚Äôt care about us.
0/0	I simply think the potential side effects are to high and I‚Äôm more then happy to take my chance with my 99.95% chance of recovery.
1/1	I simply wz stating tht if a vaccinated person gets the virus they wont end up on a ventilator
0/0	I sincerely don't see anything positive about the vaccine been said to be administered all over America, I'm definitely not going to take it because I've not heard a single positive feedback from ANYONE that has been vaccinated...it's either they grow worse or develop another kind of worse sickness.
1/1	I sincerely don‚Äôt understand why people feel the need to post negative and disrespectful comments. I can only wonder why they keep listening if they disagree with you. I am convinced that some people are just cranky. Thank you, Dr. Christy, for sharing facts and caring about patients.
0/0	I sold my house to a young couple who were expecting, about 3-4 months in. Over the course of the process, they got the vaccine. By the time we closed, the baby had been lost. Could be coincidental, sure, but with all the reports of substantial menstrual side effects after getting dosed, is that a risk that's really worth taking?
1/1	I spend a lot of time looking at the evidence objectively, and the vaccines seem like the safer bet.
1/1	I spent about 7 days in the ER due to Covid and I haven‚Äôt been vaccinated personally it‚Äôs changed my mind about getting it I‚Äôm nervous but it felt like I almost died from it and I‚Äôm only 26.
1/1	I spent over two weeks waiting to have my shattered clavicle surgically repaired because the hospitals were all full. Refusing a vaccine is selfish.
1/1	I spent the last year stuck at home because a very specific group of people refused to wear masks or take any precautions. Now you want me to let their unvaccinated selves hang out wherever I am at? No. We need to stop catering to this crowd and asking everyone else to put up with them just to go anywhere. Get vaccinated or stay home.
1	I spent the summers between my last 2 years in high school working at a camp for handicapped kids and adults who were going to spend the rest of their lives on crutches or in wheel chairs because the Salk vaccine was available too late for them. When was the last time you met someone who experienced Polio? I got the flu for the first and last time when I was 16, and made sure I got vaccinated every year after the vaccine became available. I got pneumonia when I was in 3rd grade and spent the rest of the school year working from home and I got PneumoVax as soon as it was available and whenever a new version is released. I renew my tetanus vaccine every 10 years. I showed up as soon as Moderna was released and got both shots and the booster. I'm 77 now and I have never missed a day of work due to an infectious disease. I hope the anti-vax crowd is as fortunate.
1/1	I stand behind Dr. Fauci and the amazing job that he is doing. I am doubled masked, double vaxxed, boosted, and socially distant. We need to trust the science which means listening to experts like Dr Fauci. The solution is simple: we need to enforce the vaccine mandate for everyone (including children), create a booster mandate, and enforce an N95 mask mandate. It's not that hard and anyone who does not comply should start facing some serious consequences
0/-1	I stand right with him. I am no doctor so I can‚Äôt medically explain why I personally won‚Äôt get the vaccine‚Ä¶ but I am right with him. Definitely pro-choice.
0/0	I stand with all of you and my Godly family everywhere.
0/0	I stand with the Unvaccinated!
0/0	I stand with the canadian truckers and everyone who decide not to get the jab
0/0	I state that the Corona Virus & Covid-19 illness is severely dangerous because at the moment there is no medicine for this illness and no Vaccine for vaccination of people and when Vaccine made it takes years to complete vaccination of all nations
1/1	I stayed at home for a few days with it. Totally worth three virtually painless shots.
0/0	I still ain‚Äôt getting this vaccine all of you can smd!
1/1	I still believe in science
0/0	I still can't believe how so many people refuse to acknowledge all the lies and inflated numbers that were used to sway public opinion through fear. It's like they've moved on to believing the next lie and don't have time to acknowledge the truth about being bamboozled time and time again in the recent past.
0/0	I still can't see how me not getting the jibjab puts the idiots who have had it at risk. It either works to protect you or it doesn't. Yet more of our money being used to propmote a companies product. These people should be ashamed.
1/0	I still don't know about taking it. My family is just gonna wait and see if there's side effects.
0/0	I still don't need a shot to reduce the symptoms of a virus that gives me zero symptoms.
0/0	I still don't trust vaccine from China and Russia
1/1	I still don‚Äôt get Anti-Vaccine people, I wonder what‚Äôs making them scared when the doctors literally said it‚Äôs safe..https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?service=youtube&uilel=3&passive=true&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fsignin%3Faction_handle_signin%3Dtrue%26app%3Ddesktop%26hl%3Dde%26next%3D%252Fwatch%253Fv%253DSSuxVwMkcpA&hl=de
0/0	I still don‚Äôt know if I wanna get the vaccine because what if the government wants people to die and he does not wanna tell us.What does the government wants us to take the vaccine so that more people can get sick and die
1/1	I still got mumps as an adult even with vaccinations but it was pretty minor. Even if they aren't 100% effective they give your immune system a chance to fight back if you do catch it.
0/0	I still know not one person that died of corona !! No shot fr me ! Also had corona and it was merely a small cold fr me.
0/0	I still mistrust the COVID-19 vaccines
0/0	I still retain the right to control what goes in my body. You may be confident that these corporations and government have your best interest in mind, I'm not.
0/0	I still scare,I only vac.ones for the flu.I don't want too.
0/0	I still think we have been overthrown and are watching mass murder in slow motion (aka genocide)....
0/0	I still want to see a fact-check from a leftist side on Biden's claims
0	I still wouldn't take the Oxford vaccine.
1	I stopped when they started interrupting people. Get your vaccines, it's better than being dead.
1/1	I strongly believe in the science behind vaccines, and I‚Äôm amazed at how quickly we developed highly effective and safe options for the pandemic coronavirus. I also have long experience in advising parents and using vaccines. But I don‚Äôt believe you can force people to get themselves or their children vaccinated.
1/1	I strongly believe that vaccines are very important. I am an advocate. However, people should not be mandated to take their vaccines. To be fair, restrictions should be made to segregate the vaccinated from otherwise.
1/1	I suffer bad anxiety and panic with anything medical. I‚Äôm stressing over not feeling well after having it done but it‚Äôs our duty to do it to save lives. I want an end to all this death. Pleading face
0/0	I suggest all sheep take it
1/0	I suggest that this vaccine be given to the politicians and bankers first.
0/0	I suggest we should promote and boost our natural immune system by proper exercizes and healthy food, back to basics to protect ourselves from natural internal system and this is not just about covid virus and vaccines but the other versions of virus too.
0/0	I suggest you look up the history of recalled drugs for your country and the EU. Even in normal times, drugs make it through the testing process that turn out to be dangerous. So the idea of not wanting to take a vaccine that is being rushed and under-tested isn't "not trusting science". It's wanting the full science to be applied to the drug.
1/1	I support mandatory vaccination for everyone
1/1	I support vaccines 100% and strongly recommend every one to get vaccinated!
1/1	I support you and your video I'm a firm believer in vaccinating our children safe. keep up the good work
1/1	I suppose 550,000 deaths and counting don‚Äôt matter to those who refuse to get vaccinated. It‚Äôs always the next guy that pays the price until you find yourself on a ventilator wishing you had been more aware of the danger. It‚Äôs mind boggling selfish and just plain stupid
1/1	I suppose you believe the laughable and hilarious belief that the vaccination installs some sort of micro chip too?
0/0	I sure as heck am NOT taking that thing
1/-1	I sure do trust the World Health Organization - they wouldn't lie or withhold information about anything
0/0	I sure hope it helps you and doesn't cause any harm to you. Its been rushed and god knows what it is capable of. May you be and stay healthy. Nature needs you
0/0	I sure wouldn't want to be one of the first...
0/0	I survived and have a much more robust, real immunity compared to with the vaccine. Vaccinated masked people can still catch and transmit the virus. Being vaccinated now may be putting me at risk of injury or death needlessly. Thanks anyhow.
1/1	I suspect that the general population trust a scientifically tested vaccine far more than Konspiracy Karen on the comments section.
0/0	I swear last year it was ‚Äúmy body my choice‚Äù boy have things changed. I DON'T WANT IT
1/0	I swear the thought process that went into these vaccines was clever as hell. Like, who thinks of using our own body to make the key markers of a virus which it will use to identify said virus? That's the most ingenious piece of biomedical engineering idea I've ever heard of.
1/1	I take Covaxin ... Indian made
1/1	I take a daily multi vitamin, Omega 3 fish oil, etc... I am pretty healthy as well. However, when I am able to schedule my appointment on the 31st I will plan to get the vaccine ASAP. This virus has gone on for long enough at this point.
1/1	I take a flu shot every year. Instead of autism, I only get minor pain for like 2 hours.
1	I take my responsibility as a human being on this planet by taking the shot!
1/1	I take my vaccine asap
1/0/1/1/0	I take the vaccine , after that i have all the symptoms of covid
1/1	I take the vaccine , after that i will feel great.
0/0	I take vitamins
1/1	I take what I get, satisfied because then I have done my duty
1/1	I take what I get. If it works, it works ...
0/0/0/0	I talk backswords and have a horn growing out of my head!! But never mind that. Vaxx is safe and effective
0/0	I teach my body to resist viruses by eating healthy and building my immune system I don't put any messenger in my body
1/1	I teasted positive a week ago by an accident and I didn't have any symptoms, if i haven't took that test I would be carrying virus around without realizing. Btw, I'm vaccinated so that is probably the reason I wasn't feeling sick at all. I really feel like vaccination could end pandemic, virus maybe won't disapear but hospitalization rate would be lower and we would be able to live our lifes normally again. I'm just sad that a lot of people doesn't realize that and doesn't trust science.
1/1	I tested positive 1/4, if it wasn‚Äôt for a work test, would have never have known. Not a sniffle. None of the 20+ people I was with from 12/25-1/1 (most prior + vax/boost) and nobody else had any fallout. Lost a non vax friend Saturday. I‚Äôm a firm believer.
0/0	I tested positive and took ivermectin for three days. Knowing it‚Äôs effectiveness, I now understand why big pharm is pushing so hard against it. I will never endanger my family nor myself with these experimental injections masked as vaccines.
1/1	I thank all of those who volunteered for the RECOMMENDED 3 - 7 year trials. God bless and Good luck!!
1/1	I thank countries that are making it possible for everyone to get vaccinated. Together we shall win the battle against
1/1	I thank countries that are making it possible for everyone to get vaccinated. Together we shall win the battle against covid19.
1/1	I thank you and your scientists a million times.
0/0	I think "medical treatment" (vaccines) should be a matter of choice, and it shouldn't be forced ... my humble opinion
0/0	I think "medical treatment" (vaccines) should be a matter of choice, right now you are forcing it
1/-1	I think 70% of the population should take the Covid vaccine. Would y‚Äôall let me know when you‚Äôre finished?
0/0	I think Big Pharma is insisting on vaccines to give cover for massive nuclear contamination. Vaccines CAUSE almost the same symptoms that exposure to radioactive contamination, only often more immediately apparent (nuke exposure takes 4-7 generations to show up the worst effects).
1/1	I think I heard something about Moderna thinking about combining the Flu vaccine with the Covid vaccine. I take the Flu shot every year so I think that would be great. Anything to keep everyone safe.
0/0	I think I will pass on the vaxx and take my chances.
0/-1	I think I will still take my chances and wait a while
1/1	I think I will, this entire lockdown I‚Äôve been fighting to keep my mental health in check and almost lost myself, if getting this vaccine returns life to normal I‚Äôm willing to take a chance, but I‚Äôm going to wait my turn and let others try and see the effects of the vaccine and continue to take precautions such as social distancing, wearing a mask, and predominantly staying home.
0/0/0/0/0	I think I'll give my immune system a whirl and avoid your jib jab.
0/0/0/0	I think I'll wait about 15 years before trying this out
0/-1	I think I‚Äôll get the vaccine so when I become really crippled from more toxins, I can tell everyone Mick Jagger made me do it.
0/0	I think I‚Äôll just stay home, thanks.
0/1	I think I‚Äôll pass on the Covid vaccine.
0/0	I think I‚Äôll take my chances with my own immune system thanks! If I happen to get it (as a working nurse through it all, still hasn‚Äôt happened) than I‚Äôd feel safer going with treatments than an experimental vaccine
0/-1	I think I‚Äôll wait for a few more guinea pigs to try it out. Maybe next year.
0/0	I think a mandatory vaccine order would be the end of civilization. I am sure sandnigger know it, too. I don't think it'll happen, but if it does, buckle in.
0/1	I think all vaccines look good right now. They all essentially use the same antigens. Even if some of the vaccines won't protect from disease they might protect from severe disease and death. We will see but it seems that SARS-CoV-2 is a "vaccinable" virus.
1/1	I think an anti-vaccine parents should be responsible (charged) if their child dies from a preventable illness.
1/-1/1	I think anti-vax people are just not doing any scientific research
1	I think covaxin is the best. No adverse events.
1/1	I think everyone should just get vaccinated. It's to protect yourself
1/1	I think for the vast majority the Covid vaccine is indeed relatively safe. There is a small portion of the population who will have an adverse reaction to it. The question for me isn't whether or not it's safe, it's which risk am I more willing to take...
1/1	I think having those side effects (if they exist) is better than being dead
1/1	I think if I'm not wrong vaccination is just for making our immunity better......But whatever the consequences we should necessarily take precautions. But whatever the consequences we should necessarily take precautions.
0/0	I think if the Big Pharma companies would accept liability in the event of adverse side-effects, or death, people might not be as hesitant. I think the main reason though, is it hasn't been fully tested and officially approved for use. Emergency use authorization isn't going to cut it for people on the fence.
1/1	I think if there is a vaccine made... it should be illegal NOT to get it, if you are able to get vaccinated.( I‚Äôm not talking about people who are allergic and who can not get it for medical reasons) by willingly refusing to get it , you are actively killing people and you should be thrown in jail.
1/-1	I think if you dont vaccinate you almost have to go with the proper masks for safety then. Its literally a shield. WIthout it you are inviting yourself to pure exposure, for reasons unknown. That wont help you to prevent contact or spread, the two things the virus wants.
1/1	I think if you have ever taken anything from paracetamol or aspirin to smoking or given your kids Calpol and have never questioned what active ingredients are in it but are questioning a Vaccine that is created by the same experts, then you are a hypocrite
0/0	I think if your planning on having a baby the vaxine would be the last thing you should be considering!
1/1	I think it is important and I am not throwing my shot away!
1/1	I think it should be law to have it
1/1	I think it should be mandatory!
1/1	I think it shows the FDA panel is taking the approval process and the scientific merits of the data seriously at least! which is good IMO
0/0	I think it speaks for itself these vaccine companies are protected from making things right if they kill/hurt people... Just saying.
0/0	I think it was rushed through very early, very quickly. So I would like a little more data
1/1	I think it's a good thing to take but if you don't want to take it and your ok with the risk then you shouldn't have to take it end of storu if people suffer ok that's their fault if they live happy then great let's all live happy together end the hatred
0/0	I think it's already too late late people can't open their eyes and see the truth. And I won't take that back scene I have never had a flu shot and I do just fine.
0/0	I think it's interesting that so many medical professionals are refusing to be vaccinated.
0/0	I think it's more dangerous to get the vaccine than take my chances getting Covid.
0/0	I think it's more dangerous to get the vaccine than take my chances getting Covid. If Biden becomes President, he'll force us all to get it against our will.
0/0	I think it's time for the medical profession to stand up against these mandates .
1/1	I think it's vital to get the vaccination out to the Refugee camps around the world. They have to suffer horrid conditions as it is, this just makes things worse for them. I just Pray that our Lord Jesus Christ keeps them safe
1/1	I think its a lot safer then COVID. Which people seem to forget. I‚Äôve never seen someone ask about the long term effects of COVID
0/0/0/-1	I think its all a sick sick lie and the damn mark of the beast in n a way people change this is u zee
1/1	I think it‚Äôs fantastic for our health department due to the fact that back in March, they predicted there wouldn‚Äôt be a vaccine until next April. And here we are at the end of the year with a vaccine that just got shipped to my state. Fantastic job!
1/1	I think it‚Äôs funny that people won‚Äôt get the vaccine because ‚Äúwho knows what‚Äôs in it‚Äù but will eat American cheese, hot dogs, and drink cows milk etc. But hey, do you. I‚Äôll still wear a mask to help protect you even though I‚Äôm fully vaccinated. Byeee
0/0	I think it‚Äôs reasonable to be skeptical about anything you put into your body, including vaccines
0/0	I think most have come to the realization that the vaccines don't work
0/0	I think most have come to the realization that the vaccines don't work and there are better ways of managing symptoms. If you hold out the trend will shift away from bad medicine.
0/-1	I think one of the real reasons countries and people everywhere in the world don't want the covid-19 vaccination is because covid-19 isn't seen anywhere in public. It's only on the news and people are noticing that.
1	I think parents should be charged with negligence in a court of law if their child gets sick and or dies from something that there was a vaccine for
1/0	I think people forget or unaware of what vaccines do: they trigger an immune response. Side-effects are expected.
1/1	I think people should keep in mind that Covid 19 itself can cause sometimes fatal blood clots.
1/1	I think people that step forward to advocate against the vaccine, have drawn attention to themselves. If they die its ripe for public discussion not a strictly private matter
0/0	I think possible death , keeps me from vaccinating, the healthiest people i know have never been vaccinated
0/0	I think possible death , keeps me from vaccinating, the healthiest people i know have never been vaccinated, fact
0/0/0/0/0	I think possible death , keeps me from vaccinating, the healthiest people i know have never been vaccinated, fact .
0/-1	I think staying home is effective against covid I'm healthy but praying for the ones that have this disease
1/1	I think that if the current mRNA vaccines hold up and work as well as they're supposed to and there are no long term effects they are the future for many things. The ability to plug and play is very cool.
1/-1	I think that is awesome, especially if these self-medicated morons would stay away from hospitals. Of course that is just a pipe dream because when they can‚Äôt breathe anymore, they‚Äôll be running (not literally) to the emergency room.
1/1	I think that risk goes up considerably if you actually have a clotting disorder, but if you don't, the risk is pretty much zero. My husband had a stroke caused by a clot when he was 36, so he is going to steer clear of the AZ and go for an mRNA one instead. It's great that we have options!
0/0	I think that we should wait, atleast three years, to see the results, in the long term, of the vaccine.
1/1	I think that when being vaccinated becomes compulsory in order to return to some sort of normalcy - to go on holiday or watch live sport. Many people‚Äôs scepticism will melt away as quickly as it appeared. Preferring instead to get on with their lives!
1/1	I think that's the failure of US education system whereby individualism is more important than collective well-being. I do respect that everyone should have a choice, and many people in other countries are choosing to protect the community by vaccinating.
1/1	I think the J & J vaccine is the perfect vaccine for those that are younger and healthier.
1/-1	I think the correct analogy would be a person that encourages people not use helmets when riding motorcycles or seatbelts when driving a car and then they themselves die from an accident as a result.
0/0	I think the global panic has lead to a vaccine being rushed and 5 months of testing is, in my totally uneducated opinion, not long enough to prove there won't be any adverse effects down the line.
1/1	I think the legitimacy of the vaccine is very promising.
1/1/1	I think the majority of anti-vaxxers are just uneducated. People rely too much on social media to obtain information when you should be doing actual research. I understood why Erika didn‚Äôt want to get the vaccine due to allergic reactions, but then she went on to say she doesn‚Äôt want to wear a mask and she‚Äôs healthy because she‚Äôs vegan. So that just lets me know this isn‚Äôt about your allergic reactions this is just you being ignorant. I like how the medical professionals agreed that you don‚Äôt have to get the vaccine if you don‚Äôt want to but at least practice social distancing and wearing your masks.
0/0	I think the most important point here is why force it? If the vaccine is so great people should WANT it and not be FORCED to get it! That simple point is what is making people skeptical.
1/1	I think the point of Christopher's 70+ yo parents being vaccinated, getting COVID BUT surviving, while his 53 yo unvaccinated self did not, says EVERYTHING that can be said.
1/-1	I think the pollsters asked the wrong ten people. The British grew out of being lambs to the slaughter after WW1.
0/0	I think the scientific method of experimentation is overlooked on test and analysis.
1/1	I think the vaccine is ok. I like the speaker.
1/1	I think the vaccine is our best chance to end the pandemic.
0/0	I think the vaccine is too rushed and it's a competition between several countries in the world. I don't think I need one. The COVID19 isn't more dangerous than the flu for young people like me.
1/1	I think there are people who got a first dose of the rna vax had a problem and were unable to complete the series. It sounds like the world needs this vaccine because of it's efficacy and easier refrigeration requirements .
1/1/-1	I think there will be a ton of people who will refuse to get the vaccine unfortunately
0/1	I think there's a huge amount of cowardice embedded in the anti-vaxxer movement. Fear of a scary needle and some temporary symptoms disguised in bullshit conspiracy theories.
0/-1	I think these comments are absolutely fantastic! it's gives me peace in my heart to know that people from all over the world are AWAKE!! iv researched this for years (among everything else) and it's felt like a lonely & frustrating place sometimes! But to now see how many people know their agenda is refreshing! ALL YOU NEED IS YOUR OWN IMMUNITY!! WE DO NOT CONSENT!!
1/1	I think these companies should share the recipe for the vaccine with other companies/governments so we can produce it as fast as we can. Keep developing new ones but get the ones we got out to other people. Stay healthy everyone!
0	I think these vaccines are responsible for brain shrinkage
1/-1	I think this is ok. Why because it's truth.
1/1	I think this might help end this, it looks like everyone will have a good vaccine doses or will get this variant and have anti bodies, so at least for a while after, most people will have vaccine and anti bodies at same time. No where for next variant to go.
0/0	I think unicef you are the one who created this virus, good people say no to this vaccine, trust GOD ONLY.
1/1	I think vaccines are good because if I get that virus then my body already knows how to fight it.
0/0/0	I think vaccines are hokus pokus!
1/-1	I think we are going to need to make a hard choice with respect to hospitals. We need to change the priority of patients. Other people are dying, suffering and/or not seeking treatment because these folks refuse to take a vaccine for political reasons. This of course would need to exclude children or those with medical exemptions.
1/1	I think we are now playing Russian roulette with Covid. The various new & more dangerous strains are finding their way into Australia & winter is approaching, but we think there is time to fool around being picky with lightning strike odds against various vacations options?
0/0	I think we can all agree that giving up our bodily autonomy to heartless corporations and elected officials is a bad idea
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I think we can all agree that giving up our bodily autonomy to heartless corporations and elected officials is a bad idea.
1/1	I think we overestimate the amount of anti vaxxers. I think itsjust that they're the vocal minority so sometimes especially online it can appear that everyone is an anti vaxxer even though it isn't true
1	I think you should be grateful that you get a vaccine, not everyone in the world will get it.
0/0	I think you'll find that more people will so no to the jab(if they have any sense).
1/1	I think you‚Äôll be just fine. I actually felt relieved and pretty happy once I got my shot. Kind of like a weight was being lifted. Worth it for sure!
0/0	I though a vaccine has to be tested against the actual virus before it should even be called a vaccine for it. Lets just call it what it is. A guess.
1/1	I thought I was at risk due to medication allergies but after speaking to my doctor, she recommended the COVID-19 vaccine. I got the Moderna one and fully vaccinated since March. I didn't have any major side effects and I'm still doing fine
1/1	I thought I'll get vaccinated in a year. But visited my doctor yesterday and got a shot spontaneously cause some troll didn't come. It was the Pfizer/Biontech one. I feel great, only one muscle is a little sore. Stay safe an healthy, you guys!
0/-1	I thought if people get the vaccine they can‚Äôt get COVID? So why is the video saying people who don‚Äôt get the vaccine are gonna get them sick? Aren‚Äôt you immune now since u got the shot???
0/0	I thought it was done using the "bypassing all required testing and get it done as quickly as possible approach", combined with the "let's produce tens of millions of doses while we are still testing it, so we can make the most money out of this BS plandemic approach" ...
0/0	I thought it was my body, my choice? I guess that only applies to the unborn‚Ä¶
1/1	I thought people belived more in science than in uneducated conspirations theories
1/-1	I thought the first wave of vaccines were for emergency workers, hospital workers and other important people?
1/1	I thought the same thing initially to - no way would I be first to get the vaccine...after almost a year of COVID, I'm SO ready for my shot! I want to be able to hug my dad again....and not worry about my mom. I want my daughter to get back to school
0/-1	I thought the vaccine should have done that in the first place
0/0	I thought the vaccine was going to protect us. I believe they lied.
1/1	I thought this was just for the COVID Vaccine, but nah, these crazy motherfuckers don‚Äôt get any of the shots
0/1	I told my mom I wanna join the volunteer group but being a typical asian she gave me that deadly stare..its not the virus I'm scared of
0/0	I told people do not take that dam vaccine, but no one would listen...
1/1	I too had chicken pox but mine weren't to bad no scars. At 56 my doctor had me get the shingles vaccine as my insurance paid for it. Soon as I'm allowed I'll get the Covid vaccine. Like the flu. I was so sick in 1995 from it that was enough. I get the flu vaccine yearly & haven't had the flu again
0/0	I too have noticed that the vaccinated people in my life are getting sick and the un-vaccinated are not getting sick. Why would I take a 'vaccine' that doesn't stop infection or transmission? What they are calling a vaccine is actually an mRNA therapy that supposedly lessens the severity of covid (lol).
1/1	I took Astra with weissbier...no side effects :)
1/1/1/1/1	I took Pfizer yesterday am fatigued and Have chills am Glad I took off today bc I wouldn't have been able to go to work but other than that am fine arm a Lil sore which is to be expected
0/0	I took a vaccine, was perfectly healthy before. Now I've had a chest pain especially when laying down for about a month. I'm done with this shit. I just hope I didn't get permanently fucked up.
1/1	I took it im fine y'all
1/1	I took it, I am immune compromised due to a chronic illness. I got the J&J shot. Sore arm for two days, oddly I sneezed more often for a week. No issues. In its favor I am a redhead and allergic to tons of stuff so to have so little reaction I was quite surprised.
0/0	I took it, both shots and still got a walloping case that put me down for a week. Vaccine my ass.
1/-1	I took mine and now I feel like I have the flu. It‚Äôs working! :dancer: Thank You Science!!:heart:
1/1	I took mine on Tuesday. Felt like a normal flu shot and my arm was sore for 2-3 days.
1/1	I took my first dose and only feel a minor pain in my arm.
1/1	I took my first shot of Pfizer today
1/1	I took my first shot of the vaccine today and advise you all to take it
1/1	I took my first today
1/-1	I took my mum for hers this week, I'm just hoping for the best I'm petrified of her getting covid it's been a hard week since its been offered trying to decide I just hope and pray we made the right decision
0/-1	I took my second dose yesterday and omg I feel like I‚Äôm dying. Fever, throwing up , chills and body aches.
1/0	I took my sister to get her vaccine at Creighton University yesterday, and I was surprised/happy to see hundreds of people waiting in line to get their vaccines. #mavorg
1/1	I took my two shots and felt wonderful, invigorated, brimming with vitality. I will be taking my booster shot
1/1	I took my two shots and felt wonderful, invigorated, brimming with vitality. I will be taking my booster shot just as soon as the bartender gets back from his break
0/0	I took no vaccine and doing excellently well. I guess every individual must decide what he/she is comfortable with. No one can live or die for you. So be yourself and make your choice. For me, I will never take this vaccine.
0/-1	I took sputnik second dose .. and i tested positive after a week.
0/1	I took the J&J yesterday and today y‚Äôall pulled it from the market because of blood clot scares wtf
0/1	I took the John and Janssen vaccine and feels like you're taking LSD now I'm not saying this is for all the vaccine but I kind of have Psychedelics trip for instance
1/1	I took the Johnson&Johnson b4 it got took off the shelves and I feel fine other than a small sinus feeling in my throat and nose.
1/1	I took the Pfizer Vaccine which is great
1/1	I took the Pfizer Vaccine which is great ??
1/1	I took the Pfizer vaccine when offered and also have a multitude of allergies. I was a bit anxious but... all went fine. No reaction at all. To some commenters, who are fearful, please do a risk and benefit analysis when thinking about taking the vaccine. Your risk of getting the virus is far greater than having an adverse reaction.
1/1	I took the Pfizer vaccine. Both doses. Extremely mild side effects, barely noticed them. No problems, and I've been well protected
1/1	I took the Vaccine
1/-1	I took the booster dose today .
0/0	I took the flu shot but won't take covid vaccine
1/1	I took the same vaccine but I had only high fever for the next day and it ended the next morning, but I had pain in my hand for a week After the second dose nothing happened to me except only a minor pain in the area of injection I also never heard anything worse happening to anyone I know or people around me
1/1	I took the the first and second Pfizer vaccines. On the first one, roughly 2-3 hours later, I felt like I was a bit high, then I just went to bed for a few hours and was fine.
1	I took the vaccine I feel fine, I highly recommend you take it Although it‚Äôs a free country it‚Äôs ultimately up to you Thank you for your service.
1/1	I took the vaccine and I'm grateful
1/-1	I took the vaccine and as soon as I got home I got stuck in the dryer, luckily my step bro came home a few mins later after receiving his vaccine. I guess it worked!
0/0/0/0	I took the vaccine yesterday and I got the worst migraine of my life today. The night followig the vaccination I felt chills the whole night and was freezing even with two thick hoodies on. I regret taking it so fkn much as I was completely fine before and I never got sick with covid these last 2 years

I regret taking it so fkn much as I was completely fine before and I never got sick with covid these last 2 years.
1/1	I took vaccine and my wife did had no trouble getting her pregnant definantly not a good form of birth control.
1/1	I totally agree with vaccines, they save so many lives.
1/1	I totally believe in free choice of whether to get vaccinated but choices can have repercussions. If you choose not to get vaccinated and end up sick in the hospital with COVID, you should be billed for your time there, whether health care is normally free or not.
1/1	I totally trust the covid vaccine
1/1	I transferred to Ms in the 8th grade and my shot records was missing. I had to get vaccinated all over again. My kids turned out fine, and I just had my first grandchild. All vaccinated
1/0	I treat my vaccines like my game consoles and wait for the pro version.
1/1	I tried continually from 9:00 and was not able to book a time! Site kept referring me to the next available time which was already booked when I tried to schedule it! I am 75.
0/-1	I tried to follow what you was saying, which seems to be that they excluded vaccine deaths because it wasn't what they wanted in their study.
0/-1	I truly cannot believe that this is the world that I am stuck in.
0/0	I truly do not understand why government's think covid vax is a silver bullet. I guess it's what happens when you have no tools in the tool box

1/1	I trust the vaccine.
0/0	I trust this vaccine like i trust my government! Not at all!
1/1	I trust vaccine, I don't trust anti-vaxxer
1/1	I trust you 100% sir thank you. People have been telling me I‚Äôm gonna die in two years after taking the vaccine a few weeks ago and I have been living with anxiety lately because of it. I trust you and not politicians or people in the comment section on YouTube. My dad is also a doctor and told me basically the same things you mentioned in this video.
1/1	I trusted the ‚Äú old school ‚Äú science and technology. We all got the j and j and no Covid here.
0/0	I try to convince people of the many amazing plant remedies but very few people are interested as they seem not to understand the delicacy and need for fine tuning of the human system and why shoving inadequately tested poisons in is not good .
0/0	I turned off the news and covid disappeared! Hahaha
1/1	I understand and support the priorities of who gets the vaccine first. However, I am also counting the days when I can get vaccinated
0/0	I understand it doesn‚Äôt stop you getting Covid or stop you passing it on to others.
1/1	I understand parents wanting the most information possible before making a choice for their kid. I understand wanting to talk to a doctor about risk before making that choice. I understand parents wanting to push for even better vaccines with even less risk and even more research. But it blows my mind that people are so worried about the small chance of an adverse reaction that they‚Äôd put their kids at risk for dangerous and preventable diseases
1/1	I understand that people are desperately searching for cures as COVID continues to infect our families as loved ones. The good news is we have an FDA-approved vaccine. Please take it. Don‚Äôt risk ingesting medicine meant for horses. It‚Äôs not worth it
1/1	I understand that this vaccine can be scary for people. But it has been worked on by the entire world. Scientists have had a chance to finally have unlimited budget to get something pushed through that they have been working on since 2003. Replace your fear and uncertainty with evidence and knowledge.
0/0	I understand that we are not at risk so don't force us to do what you want
1/1	I understand the anti-vax argument. But... no. Vaccines save lives. Vaccines have saved millions (if not billions) of lives. You don‚Äôt have to like something to acknowledge it‚Äôs beneficial to individuals and to society.
0/0	I understand their refusal. This vaccine was rushed and the long term effects are unknown.
1/-1	I understand there's a lot of evidence that we need to be conservative with our expectations for a vaccine, but I also don't think it's comparable to any sort of previous vaccine research.
1/-1	I understand this vaccine hesitancy very well. Several months ago, my elderly mum stated her misgivings about the possible side-effects of vaccines. So I replied, which risk would you rather run, the daily risk of getting (severe) covid, or a very minuscule chance of suffering adverse effects after vaccination. Well, in the end she and my dad have been fully vaccinated. But my baby-brother is still on the fence...
0/0/0/0/0	I understand when people get the vaccine and then say "oh it was fine I didn't have any side effects" but what scares me is that there could be side effects that don't appear until much later and we haven't had enough time to test that... I don't want to be a guinea pig
1/-1/0	I understand why the at risk and older ones are receiving the vaccination first but if there are any side effects then it will probably be put down to their age let's see what the younger more active people say
0/0	I understand your confidence in the vaccines, but remember when we were told the new diet drug Fem-fem was safe? I'm going to wait a while and let others try it out first.
1/1	I urge everyone to get the vaccine when they are offered it. It is safe, will help save lives and is the route out of the pandemic.
1/1	I used my MOM VOICE super powers on my young mortgage broker to get him to schedule his first Covid vaccine shot. He'll email me the time and place of his first shot... with his request for my financial documents.
0/0	I used to be a huge proponent of vaccination, until I watched ‚ÄúVaxxed‚Äù documentary. That made me loose trust.
1/1	I used to be anti vaccine. This week I got my eldest son (aged 3) his first vaccines and his younger brother is getting his in the next couple of week. As a mother I was terrified to harm my child with vaccines. My 3 year old didn‚Äôt even have a temperature after his injections. Don‚Äôt let fear stop you from protecting your children and it‚Äôs also ok to realise that you were wrong
1/1	I used to be skeptical about the Covid vaccine but the more science I hear about it, like this, it eases my mind.
0/-1	I used to have a brother, not since the polio vaccine.
0/-1	I used to think doctors were brilliant
1/1	I vaccinate because I believe in science

0/0	I walked to Tesco this morning through empty streets, thinking :"This is how it will be when the vaccines have killed most of the population"
1/1	I wanna get myself vaccinated as soon as possible so I can feel safe by touching my face. I‚Äôm tired of avoid touching my face and tired of worrying about things being contaminated.
1/1	I wanna get this shot. I don't wanna COVID
0/0	I wanna see what happens to Bill Gates and Fauci after they take a daily dose of this "vaccine" for a month
1/1	I wanna take my daughter to the water park this summer. Please get vaccinated!
1/0	I want a choice in what vaccine I'll choose to be inoculated with. Soon a single shot, temperature stable, viral vector vaccine will be available -- a game changer for sure
1/1	I want a choice in what vaccine I'll choose to be inoculated with. Soon a single shot, temperature stable, viral vector vaccine will be available -- a game changer for sure...üëç!
0/0	I want a guarantee from the company selling covida vaccine. The guarantees from the government are unfounded and absurd because it has sold the Nation and it falls every day. In the case of vaccine complications, I bring a case to the Court for damages of millions. compensation from the Government are nonsense .. because they don't have their money ... only ours. How am I supposed to pay myself compensation ... total nonsense
1/1	I want all this to end.. The vaccine is the way to move and do something to progress finally!!

1/1	I want my whole family to get this vaccine as soon as possible! My daughter is super high risk. I want the vaccine to be cleared for kid so she can get back some semblance of normal. She's been "locked" in my house for a year.
0/0	I want no part in the vaccine but I may be denied entry to the fire academy I was accepted into if I refused. Very conflicted.
1/1	I want no part of that shit ever again, I will take whatever shots they want to give me.
0/0	I want none of that vaccine. I agree with them! It came super fast, no studies over long-term effects at all.
0/0	I want none of that vaccine. It came super fast, no studies over long-term effects at all.
1/0	I want now what the HEAK IS IN THIS VACCENE
1/-1	I want one
1/1	I want people who are unvaxxed to be not welcome in public. Much like how it is fine if you get drunk at home but a problem if you drink and drive. You have personal convictions that the vaccine is bad? Fine
1/1	I want someone to shoot that ice cold magic elixir into my veins!
1/1	I want the Pfizer arm jab. It's the best.
1/1	I want the Pfizer ‚Ä¶
1/1	I want the idiots who choose not to get vaccinated to feel 100% American Flag Waving Free, locked up, alone, in their homes, wearing 5G tinfoil hats, laughing about microchips and hoax viruses.
1/1	I want the shot. I‚Äôm 78 with many health issues including no spleen and several autoimmune issues. I really don‚Äôt have that much time to wait.
1/1	I want the vaccine
1/1	I want the vaccine but I have so many diseases, diabetes, terrible allergies, and I'm afraid.
1/1	I want the vaccine now!
1/1	I want the vaccine so I can go to school without risking the "virus" that caused the lockdown
1/1/1	I want the vaccine, but I'm about to start 5 rounds of radiation and chemo soon, and someone told me that the since that will pretty much ruin my immune system, it would take out the effects of the vaccine anyway. Is that true of an RNA vaccine?
0	I want the vaccine. I‚Äôm scared of needles. But I really want it. I had my flu, and the latest one, anti rabies shot while strapped down to a chair with people restraining me and local anesthetic. I needed and wanted those vaccines, but I‚Äôve been abused by needles in the past hence my fear of needles.
1/-1	I want the world to go back to normal BABY !!!
1/1	I want them to see through me that the vaccine is safe
1/1	I want this vaccine

0/-1	I want to add I did have the Covid virus in Dec 2020, but it was mild, actually I felt worse after just receiving my first vaccination shot.
1	I want to be added to the number of people in the community who are protected from getting COVID-19 ‚Äî making it harder for the disease to spread and contributing to herd immunity

1/1	I want to have my normal life back again. I'll definitely take it.
1/1	I want to heartily thank EVERYONE who has done so much to develop, research, provide information, support, keep facilities super-clean, and encourage us to get COVID-19 vaccines. So many have joined up to help.
1/1	I want to keep the people I love safe, so I‚Äòm first in line. Thank you for being so outspoken about this.
0/0	I want to know WHY I should get the vaccine. Not why someone else wants me to get the vaccine. If I don‚Äôt get the vaccine, I‚Äôm possible to spread to others, I understand. But if they don‚Äôt want to get vaccinated, that‚Äôs their fault.. right? I‚Äôm totally okay and willing to be sick with COVID-19. So can someone give me a reasonable reason why I should get the vaccine? I‚Äôve been asking all my friends but there‚Äôs really no logic in their answers. But I‚Äôm truly wanting some good answers. My reason I don‚Äôt want the vaccine: I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs truly ready to be used yet. It could cause me more harm than actual COVID-19. And I‚Äôm personally not scared of getting sick at all.
1/1	I want to know if Anti-Vaxers are going to get the corona-virus vaccine when it's available or if they are going to cure covid-19 with essential oils?
1/1	I want to pay to get a vaccine shot! ASAP!
1/1	I want to save my family & other people but couldn't buy vaccine any person can provide me vaccine beaing a Human

1/1	I want to take the vaccine so bad but I feel they will get offended somehow so I'll do it in secret.
1/1	I want to travel again so Im all for the vaccine
0/-1	I want to wait and see how it works before getting vaccinated
0/0	I want to ‚Äúwait and see‚Äù how the vaccine is working for others before getting vaccinated themselves.
1/1	I wanted my belongings to be safe so me and my belongings will be vaccinated soon.
1/1	I wanted the vaccine. Was terrified while at the drive-through vaccination clinic. I almost had a panic attack. Guy talked me down. I knew it was the right thing to do to end this nightmare. Once the first one was over the second was EASY. Please, get it. Many are scared to get it but it is ok. You can do it! Please.
0/0	I warned my parents, If you wanna end up in a fucking tomb. Its best to wait. But they said, no muh Johnson and Johnson. What boomers. This entire vaccine is cyberpunk 2077 but with death
0/0	I was 20 when this started, I‚Äôll be 22 next month. These are the years I‚Äôm supposed to look back on when I‚Äôm older. I‚Äôm so depressed I haven‚Äôt experienced anything in life yet. I WILL NOT be forced to take this ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù.
0/0	I was 50/50 on deciding if I would take it not. Now it‚Äôs a 100% chance I won‚Äôt be taking it.
1/1	I was a Guinea pig as you put it and hello I'm still here
1/1	I was a bit sceptical about the Covid vaccine, but after listening to anti-vaxxers, I have now fully changed my mind and I‚Äôm 100% pro vax. No way I‚Äôm associating myself with these idiots
1	I was a covid nurse last 6 months. What a challenge and joy when people got vaccinated!!!!
0/-1	I was a little scared about the vaccination.
1/1	I was a wait and see and I was vaccinated last week with J&J and I am fine
1/1	I was able to repair my view towards them and am going in for my second Pfizer soon.
1/1	I was actually worried about the vaccine, but knowing they didn't cut corners makes me feel 100% better. Thank you so much for posting it, my family will absolutely vaccinate as soon as we can
1/0	I was an absolute pro-vaxxer as well. TTAV series changed me. I am not Anti-Vaccine But I do think Vaccines are not as safe as we are told. Definitely a risky business!
1/1	I was at more risk in getting a blood clot when I was on the contraceptive pill. There is always a small risk in anything you do or take on a daily basis. I have had the AZ jab even though that risk is there.
0/1	I was beyond hesitate to get the vaccine. But once I got in contact with 3 fellow coworkers, and tested negative for 2 weeks. I didn‚Äôt want to chance another another scare and risk my loved ones who are still at home. I did it for my love ones...
1/1	I was born in 1965 with rubella, my mother tells how it was the scariest thing that ever happened in her life when I nearly died as a newborn. I dont know why I was lucky enough to survive, without life long issues related to rubella. Vaccines have saved millions of children since 1965, babies are vulnerable, it's so important to vaccinate yourself and protect them.
1	I was called a child abuser by an anti-vaxxer once. How ironic.
0/0	I was conflicted until I spoke with my doctor. Since the CDC does not know all the side effects. and adverse effects of taking either vaccine. I declined and will continue to isolate.
0/0	I was contacted by my local surgery today for the sole purpose of arranging an appointment for the "Covid 19 injection", I swiftly thanked the caller for not referring to the injection as a vaccine, then politely refused the invatation with a request to never contact me again in reference to this experiment again. You the reader would be well advised to responsibly research this trial and it's exact purpose before consenting to enter into an agreement to what I understand is a non reversable genetic modification to your natural body.
0/0	I was excited about getting my first shot today till the nurse advised me to be ready to call 911 should I experience shortness of breath or skin rash afterwards!
1/1	I was fortunate and grateful to get the first dose of my #COVID19 vaccine today
1/0	I was fortunate to grow up in the 1950s, when vaccines were required to attend public schools. That makes me old enough to remember older kids that were tragically paralyzed for life polio victims from the time before the Salk vaccine was available.
0/0	I was fully vaccinated and still got the original Covid 19 version. I am 65 and a bit overweight. I cannot believe that people have been vaccinated 4 times. I can assure you I wont.
0/0	I was getting the vaccine. After seeing this, I am not. My kids need me. They lost their dad in 2013. I‚Äôm all they have left. I‚Äôll take my chances without the vaccine.
1/1	I was given the pfizer vaccine and I'm still alive and had no side effects.
0/0	I was gonna get it until a close friend of mine got the first dose & almost died so I‚Äôm good that I dont vaccinated
1/1	I was hesitant about the vaccine at first but now that Dr. Seema explained it so well I will definitely be getting it
1/1	I was hesitant about the vaccine at first but now that Dr. Seema explained it so well I will definitely be getting it.
1/1	I was hoping for your usual introduction. But thanks for this video. I can‚Äôt wait for my vaccine.
1/1	I was hospitalized with Covid before the vaccine was available. I nearly died. This was in March 2020. As of today (Aug 2021) I'm still having breathing issues, fatigue, and heart issues. I recently received a pacemaker implant. As I sit and watch these folks refuse vaccinations, I just want to scream. Covid is no joke. They still don't know the long-term effects. My life has changed dramatically since my illness and not for the better.
0/-1	I was in perfect health then did my first round. I have had an accelerated heart beat day and night for almost a month since the vaccination. Now there is great pressure on me to take the second shot. Don't know what to do.
1/1	I was in the study, I now have immunity, the side effects were minor.
1/1	I was in this study. Very safe
0/0	I was initially a full supporter of the vaccine and am fully vaccinated at this point but things are not adding up and the way the media acts like absolutely nothing can be wrong with the vaccine / it can‚Äôt be questioned is terrifying.
1/1	I was initially distrustful of the vaccination until I spoke to my Dad who caught covid but is still alive, later he recovered from it.
0/0	I was just reading an article in new republic independent propaganda news online... under an article under the apocalypse category, called something like ‚Äòare we ready for the vaccine‚Äô ... they talked about the ‚Äòquick‚Äô method they are using for future plandemics... they are planning to create more pandemics to scare the sheeple for more vaccines. This is not going to be the last of these plandemics.
1/1	I was just talking to a friend who's waiting for the vaccine. At first he thought he would have no trouble getting the shot, but apparently a lot more people are volunteering so that's a good sign.
1/1	I was legitimately astonished when I heard someone say "they put some of the disease in the vaccine!?" Yeah, how did you think they made it?
0/0	I was listening to a top professor who was talking about the vaccine and they said you might just be immune for 5 months!!! What‚Äôs the point than. Personally I‚Äôm not having any vaccine
1	I was literally praying "please let me get my shot by the end of May" ever since they started rolling out but I didn't think it would happen
1/-1	I was literally waiting to get the vaccine when the video was uploaded
1/1	I was literally waiting to get the vaccine.
1/1	I was lucky I got my first dose of Moderna, get next on APRIL 7TH.
1/1	I was nervous about getting the vaccine at first, but my children encouraged me to do it. I got it and had no symptoms at all except a slight sore arm on the first one. I'm so glad that I got the vaccine. If I can do my part to stop the spread of this horrible disease then it is worth it in my eyes. Plus, what is the big deal of wearing a mask. I dont mind wearing the mask at all. I just want to do whatever it takes to stop the spread of this disease.
1/1	I was nervous about having mine, not least because I‚Äôm scared of needles and because i had heard about side effects. However in my case the jab was one of the easiest I‚Äôve ever had and aside from my arm feeling like I‚Äôd been punched the following day, i had no other issues. I strongly recommend everyone having it when possible.
0/1	I was nervous to get the vaccine but I got it because my school has greatly suggested it and I kinda messed up and promised a teacher I would I got my second dose on the 4th and I felt fine besides some pain and swelling at the injection site, but now I‚Äôm starting to get a little feverish and just a bit of chills. Apparently that‚Äôs a good thing so üò©pray for me!
0/0	I was never an anti vaxxer but covid 19 lies & manipulation has turned me into one.
0/0	I was never hesitant. I knew while the vaccines were being created that I was never going to get one. I don't need shots to protect me from Covid because I'm in good health. Maybe you're influenced by what talking heads tell you, but I'm not. I do my own thing.
0/0	I was never vaccinated (not even as a baby, I was born at home) and I'm 22 now and I've always been fine
1/-1	I was offered the J&J shot and turned it down. I waited a few weeks until Pfizer was available and got that instead. My only side effect was feeling tired for a day after my first shot. I get my second shot in a week.
0/0	I was offered the vaccine and I decided to pass. Not much of a risk taker. Too many "UNKOWNS." I get what the Dr. is saying. However I feel anytime you choose speed and quantity you are risking quality. I am not an antivacer by any means. Just gonna go with a bit of common sense, logic, reasoning, and my own intuition. Thank you to all of those who have faith in the vaccine & the govenment that are willing to take one for the team. I need to see more cases and I want to give it time. So thank you for taking the risk...you are all true heroes.‚ù§ The benefits do not outweigh the risks for me currently...and I don't care to be a hero. This is the best decision for me...not suggesting anyone do the same. So if you have something negative to say...save it. No one is going to change my mind and I really give ZERO shits about what others opinions have on how I live my life.
1/1	I was on the fence, and now I'm more on the side of pro vaccine.
0/-1	I was once a herpes patient, but now I have finally got rid of it with the help of Ben Uda on youtube channel, with his Herbal medicine which he prepare for me.
1/1	I was part of that trial and had minimal ill effects so i am super excited to be part of a solution like this!
1/1	I was proud to get the COVID-19 vaccine earlier today at Morehouse School of Medicine. I hope you do the same!
1/1	I was really nervous about getting my jab. The lady that gave it to me was so good I had to ask her whether she has done it, I had looked away of course, she said yes. I guess she had got quite a lot of practice. Less nervous about jabs in the future.
1/1	I was registered, I was ready. The vaccination clinic was cancelled the day before it was supposed to happen.
1/0	I was scared to get the vaccine. I am terrified of needles
1/1	I was scheduled to get a vaccine after seeing my doctor but the appointment was cancelled due to shortages, but if I can get a new appt I am still 100% on board with getting the shot. I will feel much safer
1/1	I was second guessing the vaccine but I‚Äôm ready now!
0/0	I was sick in covid, now I have natural immunity that‚Äôs better than these shots
1/1	I was single jabbed here in the uk, im a 32 year old man and my Girlfreind is 27 and we both tested positive for Covid 3 days in and we're really sick. It's such a struggle to even get out of bed but we have a 1 year to look after so we have no choice. It's tough. Believe me get your jabs. Im glad we did because it could have been a lot worse.
1/1	I was sitting on the fence up until now and I have decided to give it a go ahead. However I still don‚Äôt agree with coercion, the more the authorities coerce, the more people are likely to rebel against mandated vaccines
0/0/0/0	I was so happy when I saw the dislike number on this video. If you want a shot, go get it. People don't want it
0	I was so happy when I saw the dislike number on this video. If you want a shot, go get it. People don't want it.
0/-1	I was so healthy before. now my heart has pain and I wake up feeling like I got hit by a truck 7 days later
1/1	I was so relieved after my first dose! Second one 05/03
1/1	I was so relieved my country was getting the vaccine in a few months, I've been neurotically cleaning and staying safe and just when I thought I was in the final lap, I got the Rona üòÇ.
1/-1	I was surprised my devout catholic, trump supporting, fox news watching parents got the vaccine right when it was available to them.
1/1	I was talking to a physician at a regional medical center over the weekend. At his hospital, over 95% of the physicians have chosen to get vaccinated, and just 45% of the nursing staff. I found that disheartening.
1/1	I was thankful to get my 2nd vaccination today.
1/1	I was thinking about all of the orgies that folks have participated in and didn‚Äôt catch a disease. The put their lives at risk because of lust. How many times folks have taken drugs. Shared needles for a habit and are alive. When you take cancer drugs it‚Äôs poison but the doctor let‚Äôs know it‚Äôs your only hope. But when they‚Äôre asked to take a vaccine for a planetary plague they lose their shyt!
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I was thinking about not getting it. But now that it‚Äôs being forced. I‚Äôm definitely NOT getting it
0/0	I was told I was a conspiracy theorist when I pointed out to my friends that the four slots on their vaccine card were there for a reason and that they‚Äôd all be filled one way or another.
1/1	I was vaccinated December but I got Covid, but the good part is that I didn't have any symptoms except of minor running nose and minor headaches for couple of days. So getting covid vaccine was worth it.
1/1	I was vaccinated Siobhain...very sore and nauseated but subsided just waiting for another 10 days for 2nd dose..hope you have got vaccinated thank you for your vlogs.
1/1	I was vaccinated with Moderna, I‚Äôm 61 I have RA, take 2 Humira shots a month so my immune system was compromised to catch COVID-19. I‚Äôve had NO side effects from my vaccine which has been almost a month no. Yes I wear a mask when required and when around a lot of people.
1/1	I was vaccinated with the J&J a couple weeks ago. I had a slight case of the chills that evening, my only side effects. I did not risk my life. I wasn't part of a great conspiracy. I am a adult making a rational decision about my health care. If you feel the need to make ridiculous comments march yourself to the nearest corner for a time out.
1/1	I was vaccinated with the vaccine a couple weeks ago, I had the chills for about 40 minutes that evening. Thats it for side effects and I appreciate that If I get Covid it won't be a serious case. I continue to social distance and mask wearing in indoor public spaces.
1/1	I was vaccinated yesterday, had a high temperature of 38.4C at night and 37.4 as for now (19:00 of the next day). I'm actually happy that I'm among 40k lucky ones. Let's see what happens next.
1/1	I was vaccinated, then I caught COVID-19, it was a couple of hours with a sneeze, and cough, I was better in a week!
0/-1	I was vaccinated...I had the chickenpox, measles and the mumps and had the flu on a yearly basis. So what did I have injected in me?
1/0	I was vaccine hesitant and because of you I have ended up getting the shots. My wife and a lot of my friends aren't impressed with my decision to do so and they think I will not be around in 3 years. You seem to make sense to me. Thanks
1/1/1/1	I was vaccine hesitant for awhile since I had covid 2 times and only got moderate symptoms but now with the rise of the delta and other variants I decided to get vaccinated and so far I am very happy with my choice and my ability to look past all this fake news crap about the vaccine!! Now I just gotta convince my dad! Wish me luck
1/-1	I was very curious about this vaccine and a lot of my questions are answered. Thank you.
1/1	I was very happy to see you were vaccinated. Must be a relief.
0/0	I was very healthy before taking jabs. Forget immunity I feel tired and feverish every day. Not able to do any exercise since vaccination. It has been more than two months now...
1/1	I was worried in the beginning but i got it anyways (Both doses of Moderna Covid19 Vaccine) and i‚Äôm completely fine. I felt sleepy the day I got the second dose though but that‚Äôs about it. Mom got Johnson and Johnson and she‚Äôs in the age group where clotting occurs most even if it‚Äôs rare but she was fine after her shot and it‚Äôs been a couple of months. Do it being able to relax a little bit after getting the shot alone makes it worth it
1/1	I wasn't doubting the vaccine
0/0	I wasn‚Äôt anti vax, saved countless lives they‚Äôre brilliant. However, thanks to the government‚Äôs campaign to coerce me into having the vaccine unnecessarily, I am now sceptical of all vaccines. Thanks.
1/1	I wasn‚Äôt gonna get it but i Changed my mind it‚Äôs either get the vaccine or die from covid and plus it‚Äôs saving people‚Äôs life‚Äôs as well
1/1	I wasvaccinated on 01/22, still doing good! Had mild soreness at site of injection for first two days. No other symptoms, but still monitoring
1/1/1	I watched a lot of videos about the Pfizer vaccine to try and understand how it works but this was the first one that made it clear yet simple to understand. Thank you!
1/-1	I watched the video of the nurse getting vaccine this morning and tried hard to squint to see it (imo correctly) as incredible / exciting as eg SpaceX launches
0/-1	I wear a mask and stay out of big public places.
1/1/0	I wear a mask and take care as much as I could but it's risky either way ,I will take the vaccine when a reliable vaccine is at hand
1/1	I wear my mask and am getting my second dose next week. I don't care what others do. Just if they are ignorant anti mask/anti vax type they should be denied medical care since they didn't believe it to begin with. Cull the stupid.
1/1	I welcome both this article & the vaccine. It's a remarkable achievement. But I can't help wondering whether this type o vaccine is just too expensive & too difficult to transport to have a long term future. Most of us will get something like the Astra Zeneca jab next year. Let's hope the optimum dosage issue can be resolved soon.
1	I went and got vaccinated as soon as I could, for my own piece of mind and safety ... I really don't understand the reasons the unvaccinated hospitalized are giving now.
0/0	I went to get my vaccine. I read the disclaimer form and said no thanks. I am not signing that and walked out.
1/1	I went with JJ. I felt more comfortable since the vaccine technology is already being used. JJ has similar protection at day 56 and less allergic responses etc. however I did get a fever and severe chills/ muscle aches

0/0	I will absolutely refuse to take a coronavirus vaccine.

We haven‚Äôt seen my family since February, including my elderly father in Ireland who is not in the best of health, and the Spanish family since Christmas. Two of my siblings who live in the US haven‚Äôt met my 17-month-old yet and her family on both sides are missing out on some of the most special times of her life.

1/1/1/1	I will be getting my covid shot in early February on the occasion of my 75th birthday because I don‚Äôt want to die just now. I‚Äôll do that later at a time of my own choosing.
1/1	I will be getting the third dose as soon as it‚Äôs available.
1/1	I will be getting the vaccine asap. My parents are both in several high risk categories. I have been so scared for them and want to protect them as much as possible.
1/1	I will be happy to get vaccinated as soon as it‚Äôs available to me. I am not a scientist any more, but I generally trust the drug companies to do their jobs correctly, and not put out a vaccine that is extremely unsafe.
1/1	I will be happy to take a booster, they need to offer it to those that want it over 80 asap..
1/1	I will be in line as soon as it is offered!
1/1	I will be in quarantine for a full year on March 2nd I GENUINELY hope I have mine by then. I just got a letter from my doctors (post lung transplant clinic) today saying ‚ÄúCOVID has highly adverse risks‚Äù - for you etc. then ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know anything essentially‚Äù. This is the first letter in the pandemic they‚Äôve sent me at all I‚Äôm just here like ????? at this point. I just want my shot and this to be done.
1/1	I will be one of the first in line to get mine! Get vaccinated people!
0/1	I will be placing a curse on every evangelical, baptist,pro lifer, all lives matter, bigots. We are so tired of your existence. You say ‚Äúnot all‚Äù but you are apart of ‚Äúall‚Äù. Since they won‚Äôt take the vaccine I‚Äôll make sure that they get covid .
0/0	I will be refusing the vaccine, because I will not let the government control my body. I will not let the government to alter my DNA either. The vaccine modifies a persons DNA, even Moderna admits this. Just check their website. GOD does not want us to change/alter our DNA. DNA is sacred. DO NOT take the vaccine.
0/0	I will be taking a very cautious wait to see how the vaccines play out. I had an extremely bad experience with the flu vaccine many years ago.
1/1	I will be taking it, no doubt. Got vulnerable family members.
0/0	I will be the last human vaccinated
0/0/0	I will be the last human vaccinatedüòÇ

1/1	I will cheerfully take whichever of these vaccines I can get ASAP.
0/0	I will continue to allow my immune system to do its job with no experimental vaccine!

1/1	I will definitely get it!
1/1	I will definitely get it, but I won't be first in line either.
1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/0	I will definitely get the vaccine,but I want to give it some time before I do.
0/0	I will definitely not be taking it myself and I applaud these nurses for exercising their constitutional rights as American citizens!
1/1	I will definitely take it. But I have a feeling that the Covid vaccines are more of a flu shot type of vaccine where you will have to take another few shots till the vaccine is perfect and able to fend off the new variant strains. That's is my opinion.
1/1	I will definitely take the vaccine. I will still get Covid sooner or later. Better to get vaccinated than to be infected with a fully developed disease by some disgusting laboratory virus from China.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I will die before I‚Äôm forced to get jabbed. I refuse to put that poison in my body!!

1/1	I will jad and will encourage my family to be vaccined.
1/1	I will just mention that I am totally pro-vaccine and will be getting a booster if and when I get the go-ahead to do so.
0/0	I will just quit my job and stay home to teach my kids and continue to grow my own food like we should be living while everyone else become part of the genetic dna altering experiment
1/0	I will let my immune system which has been developing for thousands of years fight this. With 99.8% odds, I will take that bet every time!
1/1/1/1	I will line up to get an effective and safe vaccine as soon as one with FDA approval is available to me because I‚Äôm 59 years old, I‚Äôve had asthma and COPD since I was 10, and a heart attack a few years ago‚Ä¶and I don‚Äôt want to die.
0/0	I will most assuredly not get vaccinated because my government tells me to, and promises in return, I'll be granted freedom. Let's be clear about one thing... no one grants me freedom, for I am a Free Person
0/0	I will never accept this vaccine even at a gun point. No vaccines to Africa

1/1	I will take a vaccine that has passed review and clinical trials for safety and efficacy. I care not where it was made or about the ethnicity of the people who made it, so long as it has been demonstrated safe and effective.
1/1	I will take any vaccine just let me have one.
1/1	I will take it
1/1	I will take it ...get it approved Joe ByeDon
1/1	I will take it at the first opportunity it is offered. I feel like there are theoretical concerns about mRNA vaccines, but in statistical probability of actually occuring based on the results of the trials already conducted? Obviously we don't have the full trials to really know the risk, but it's enough for me
1/1	I will take it because intelligent people did proper research.
1/1	I will take it or I am gonna dieee
1/1	I will take it the minute I can. I dont care about any side effects or damage people claim it does.
1/1/1/1	I will take it, I think that although I‚Äôm not very comfortable with the idea that it‚Äôs brand new and not a massive amount of information regarding side effects, I would very much like to be able to attempt to get society and general life back on track as at present (in the UK) being locked down and unable to see loved ones is putting a lot of negatives on my mental health.
1/1	I will take it. I have had all my vaccinations and so have my children. We have never had any side effects. I‚Äôm not worried about this one!

1/1	I will take vaccine side effects 1,000 times over if it means I can hug my dad without fear of getting him sick. 10 days until I‚Äôm home
1/1	I will take whatever they offer me as soon as I can. Frankly, I think we‚Äôve gotten very bad at assessing risk in all this. The risk of a clot due to COVID is much higher than the risk of a clot due to a vaccine, so please, hook it to my veins!
1/1	I will take whatever vaccine is offered as soon as possible.
1/1	I will take whichever vaccine whenever I‚Äôm eligible to get one. Each vaccine dose is a rock to break down the pandemic wall between us all.
0/0	I will trust the vaccine when all CDC employees get the vaccine. If the vaccine worked why wouldn‚Äôt it be mandatory for everyone
0/0	I will wait 1 year before I take it‚Ä¶ atleast
1/1	I will wait for a different vaccine, not a j&j one. They have blood on their hands.
0/0	I will wait to get the covid vaccine until it is proven safe. My son died in 2006 from a reaction to the anthrax vaccine when he was in the army! They said it was safe too! I do get a flu shot every year, not against vaccines just don't like the ones that aren't fully tested.

0/0	I wish more melanated people would do their research instead of trusting the vaccine
1/1/1/1/1/1/1	I wish more people would watch this and understand that this is not poison this is not going to change your RNA. So many people don't understand science
1/1	I wish my postal carrier housemate would get hers too, but she doesn't want to take it until it's been many months to be sure there is no side effects. Do to my comorbidities, covid would probably kill me, so it's a clear choice. I wish it was for her, too, but alas, it isn't.
1/1	I wish nobody was antivax... But your speech reminded me of Idiocracy. It was not supposed to be a documentary... But, scientifically talking, there is another thing when a part of the population recuses to get the vaccines: the natural selection is also available to the viruses: stronger mutations appear and spread, including more fatal new variations... And it makes the vaccination loses strength. Vaccination, to be effective, needs to be respected as a collective pact...
1/1	I wish people would take it seriously so we can try to get back to normal in the future
0/1	I wish people would understand that the science behind this ‚Äúnew‚Äù type of vaccine is more than two decades old.
1/1	I wish reddit would join FB and Amazon in banning anti-vaccine content. Every vaccine post on /r/conservative is full of comments saying the virus is a hoax and the vaccine will harm you.

1/1	I wish that all people in the world be protected against covid 19 , by vaccination or by other medicine .
1/-1	I wish the best for the people you interviewed and I hope they all recover and stay healthy, that said by choosing not to get the vaccine to some degree I feel like they put themselves in that position.
1/1	I wish the media would stop hammering on about blood clots. We need to vaccinate the population as quickly as possible and scare stories are not helping the authorities.The
1/1	I wish there was a vaccine against stupidity and paranoia.

1/1	I wish they would have Started with younger people who have Children who need both of there parents,
1/1/1/1/1	I wish this mRNA thing works out and we get to have faster and more effective vaccines for now on. The flu vaccine is not even 50% effective and this new vaccine is about 95% effective.

1/1	I wonder how many people here making comments would have shunned the polio vaccine. Or the measles or all of the other vaccines that came out years ago. Everybody seems to think they are a doctor.
0/0/-1	I wonder how those who unknowingly got the placebo and then got sick were monitored and got to be statistics. Hoax!

0/0	I wonder if she would feel the same after watching Vaxxed ( Vaxxed 2)... I wonder if her thesis would be the same after seeing the families affected by the side effects of those who did get the vaccines. I comment this because she pointed out the saving of "one child" is enough reason...
1/-1	I wonder if the antivax crowd vaccinates their dogs.
1/0	I wonder if this data will bring about a change in the policies of some countries not to use this vaccine on the over 65s. Lets hope its not too late for this obvious error to be corrected.

He should now work on a vaccine for cancer , should only take what 6 months of so ? All the BS aside how can this vaccine be regulated and safe ?? Facts I‚Äôve read , it‚Äôs not !
0/0	I won‚Äôt be taking a vaccine for covid. I don‚Äôt take a flu vaccine either, even though I‚Äôve been offered it, simply because it‚Äôs my choice. I‚Äôm not anti-vax nor am I an idiot. If someone decides to take it then that‚Äôs their choice. Respect both choices or non.

0/0	I won‚Äôt be taking this vaccine!
0/0	I won‚Äôt be taking this vaccine! We are still taking a shot for the flu. The flu started in 1918. What makes this vaccine so scary is that it‚Äôs been made so quickly and all the safety side effects aren‚Äôt really known. Two months is not enough time to find out the side effects. I‚Äôm a Respiratory Therapist and this shot is scary!

If it‚Äôs so safe, why does the manufacturer need to be absolved of liability?!
0/0/0/0	I won‚Äôt take this vaccine

1/1	I work in Pfizer, I worked on a part of the dev of this new vaccine, we have an high standard safe procedures, the vaccine is the best weapon against this virus

1/-1	I work in a nursing home. Still haven't gotten mine yet.
0/-1	I work in an office with 5 other people. 1 person is vaccinated and the rest of us are not. The 1 vaccinated person caught covid and brought it in. 2 out of the 5 unvaccinated people caught it and recovered within a week. The vaccinated guy was out for 3 weeks
1/1	I work in clinical trials, and I know the standard operating procedures when study drugs are put on the market. The data, and all raw data from research comes from regular people and NOT the pharmaceutical company. This comes from doctors, nurses, and research coordinators working in university hospitals. Generally speaking, physicians do not collect and report data. This is usually someone who does not have a medical background or may. In cases as such, data is sometimes reported inaccurately. Additionally, there will always be adverse events. Whether it is related to COVID-19 vaccine or not, adverse events will always be reported and can range from farting, knee pain, to severe dyspnea. Then, a safety board monitoring panel then gets together to determine if a serious adverse event is associated with the vaccine or not. If you are hospitalized while on study, then there is a possibility that it can be associated with the vaccine. Serious adverse events = Related to study drug/vaccine Adverse event = unlikely related to study drug Point is, there is no such thing as a safe drug and not even the vaccine. The truth is, YOU should determine what is good for your body and what is not. I am pro-vaccine, but I am also smart enough to question whether or not something is good for me. And no, you are not a moron if you decline the vaccine. I think there is a huge witch hunt to convince someone to take something that usually takes 5 years to get approved
0/0	I work in health care and ever single patient I have had that has gotten the vaccine has severe side effects that knock them out for at least 1-2 days. I would not suggest the vaccine!
0/0	I work in health care. I wont be getting the vaccine. I wont be telling others to do it either.
1/1	I work in healthcare and I've been fully vaccinated. I believe in the vaccine and have seen its benefits in my hospital. I CHOSE to have it because of many factors, and that choice was very important.
0/0	I work in healthcare. We've had 3 elderly people who took this vaccine and ended up in emergency situations (fainting, hard to breathe, etc). I personally, don't trust it because I am black. I remember the Tuskegee experiment they unleashed in my ancestors. These vaccines aren't made with all ethnicities genetics in mind.
0/0	I work in paediatrics and there is a huge increase in teen cardio and neurological referrals coming in and almost every one of those children have been jabbed‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs abhorrent what is going on here. Must I now see the same in the young children?
1/1	I work in senior living and we are anticipating receiving our vaccines mid/end of January - early February. I‚Äôm nervous to get it but I‚Äôm thankful to be apart of one of the ‚Äúfirsts‚Äù to have the opportunity to receive it
0/0	I work in social care so had my first Pfizer jab yesterday and feel worse than I did going into septic shock with a massive infection throughout my whole abdomen a few years ago. I don't think I'll go back for the 2nd.
1/1	I work in the NHS in the UK as a key worker and have just had my 1st dose of the Pfizer jab today Only symptom so far is a bit of a sore arm! (Like the flu jab)
1/1	I work in the office of a nursing home. When I talked to family members of our guests about side effects when they were asked to give consent to get the elderly people vaccinated I prefered to call the expected side effects vaccine reactions or immune reactions. And told them that showing some of them is a good sign that the body is working well
1/1	I work in vaccines and watching my company and my industry snap into action and do what we were all built to do is inspiring. Lots of research teams and small biologics companies have been quietly preparing for this. Building the technologies and the production capacity is a decades long project, all we are seeing now is what it looks like when you mobilize it.
1/1	I worked in Big Pharma for 30 years now, I will take the vaccines and I am completely sure about it
1/1/1	I worried about bringing covid home incessantly this past year & my choice of caring for covid patients would make my kids sick. After what I have seen this year, I can not explain how grateful I am for this vaccine and how grateful I am that my whole family is now protected.
1/1	I worry we won't hit 75%. Not because of a lack of effort or trying. I'm afraid that 35% of the damn country is going to be stupid enough to refuse the vaccine.

1	I would have no problem with a vaccine booster every 3 months if it makes this go away
1/1/1/1	I would heavily advise you to get the vaccine but I can't force you to. Furthermore, you will probably lose your job if you work directly with people, so as not to put others at risk. Regardless, please reconsider and if I can help in anyway provide some comfort or information to persuade you, please let me know.
1/1	I would just like to be able to get the vaccine. It will take forever to vaccinate people at the rate. It is pathetic how this is being done.
1/1	I would just like to say thank you to all your staff for all they are doing rolling out the covid vaccines. I have just returned from my father having his Covid jab at River Lodge this morning and I was impressed at how efficient the set up was - in and out in 20 minutes
0/0	I would like to be able to choose which vaccine I will be taking that would make me go from no to yes. but because you want to force vaccines banned in other countries in me I have to say no most likely not until the freedom to choose which one you want is available. Plus I really wanted the Russian one so I'm picking some vaccine which is not as good to begin with.
1/1	I would like to extend my personal thanks to all the scientific and medical staff who have worked so tirelessly throughout this whole damn thing. We are no there yet but these vaccine trials look very promising.
1/1	I would like to get a vaccine that is safe and very effective
0/-1	I would like to know how you know that the vaccine makes you less likely to go to hospital, what proof is there?
0/0	I would like to know why the ceo of Pfizer won‚Äôt be taking his own vaccines and why the doctors and consultants in their numbers are removed from their jobs for not wanting to take it . If this was all about the health and safety of the people , it is absolutely wrong and immoral for the health professionals to be removed from their jobs when they are providing great service. This was all about the shares the government and MPs had with Pfizer and moderna to increase their own pockets üí∞
0/0	I would like to know why we need to sign a waiver if vaccines are safe.
1	I would like to say to all the anti vax people that you have to stop think only for yourself, take the shot! it is secure and will help everyone
0/0	I would like to see a study to find out if there are any correlations between the vaccinated and the hiv positive for possibly being the source for all these variants #vaccine
1/1	I would like to see more of this type of debate but more vs the anti vaxxers ATM. Good counter arguments and pointers to where to find good info on the more subtle details of vaccines
1/1	I would like to thank the healthcare providers in Green Bay for being so proactive in getting the vaccine out. You are doing an amazing job and it is appreciated!
0/0	I would like to travel again at some stage, but i don‚Äôt want to be told i can‚Äôt travel unless i have had a vaccine. That would be like something out of a communist country.
0/0	I would love the explanation of how being vaccinated stops the spread..
1/1	I would love to convince my coworkers who refuse to vaccinate but Hidden Brain has also taught me that you can‚Äôt change people‚Äôs minds with facts
0/0	I would love to have more info on the vaccine and pregnancy. Is there enough information to prove the vaccine is safe for woman trying to have a baby in their late 30's? This is what is stopping me from getting the vaccine. I don't know what is the safest option here. I have read that in the UK the miscarriage rate has gone up, it was also pointed out that most of the women were vaccinated.
1/1/1	I would love to have the vaccine but I got now doctors so I carn't have it so I am sad
1/-1	I would love to see her say what she said about the pandemic to someone who‚Äôs family member has died from covid
0/0/0/0/0	I would more likely stay safe by keeping up my personal hygiene, sleeping good and eating well, and do some sports. And use herbal ways to heal my body from covid, not vaccine
1/1	I would much rather take the risk of getting the vaccine than catching covid and dying or passing it to my loved ones.
0/0	I would need more answers before I decided to get the vaccine.
0/0	I would never take it
0/0	I would never take this 100% poison no matter how much money you gave me. People are so stupid injecting this non approved garbage into them.
0/0	I would never trust anything developed under an administration who sees lies as truth and incompetence as the normal state of operation.
1/-1	I would never trust today tests, a cold triggers a positive
1/1	I would never vaccinate my children. Its irresponsible and dangerous. Instead, i take them to a doctor who is properly equipped to do this.
0/0/0/0	I would not get one. I choose to take care of my health by taking probiotcs, various supplments Vit D, I eat whole foods and exercise. I wear a mask to shop and stick close to home. No vaccine here!
0/0	I would not get the coronavirus.
1/1	I would not hesitate for a moment when my turn comes up to get vaccinated and to have my family vaccinated
1/1	I would not hesitate to take the covid vaccine every year, if necessary.
0/0	I would not see myself as a man if I put the vaccine in my childrens body
0/0	I would not take it. They fast tracked it and bypassed many testing. In the UK, they have already found people are having reactions to it.
0	I would not trust anything the company says about the vaccine reactions.. they will cover it as not them!
0/0	I would not vaccinate my teens. It‚Äôs killing people and a lot of Adverse reactions
1/1	I would not want to be treated by an unvaccinated healthcare worker. If they won't do something simple like get a vaccine, what other safety measures are the not following.
0/-1	I would point out that they are in so much fear that they want masks and lockdowns, whereas I trust in my immune system.
0/0	I would quit my job if I had to get that vaccine, genocide.

1/1	I would rather have a child with autism than a child who dies of measles or polio
0/0	I would rather have a lion roar in my face for 1 minute than to take the covid vaccine
0/0	I would rather have covid and take my chances with the 0.07 percent of making me ill
0/0	I would rather have covid every year for the rest of my life than put this mystery BS in my system.
1/1	I would rather have side effects from the vaccine than Covid I felt like l had won the lottery last Sunday when l received my 1st Pfizer vaccine. I may of had a sore arm and felt tired for a few days, but when you've been shielding due to being extremely vulnerable it's nothing!
1/1	I would rather have the Vaccines, & happily be above ground, than below the ground. Get Vaccinated, Please Folks.
0/0	I would rather inject covid (99.3% survival rate according to BBC) than the experimemtal vaccine which you still can get covid after taking.
1/1	I would rather listen to a flat earther talk about their opinions than anti vaxxer
0/0	I would rather take my chances with covid and my Maker than the vaccine.
0/0	I would rather take the fertilized chicken egg with the virus, better vaccine
1/1	I would recommend it to a lot of people that don‚Äôt want to get it and a lot of those people voted for me, frankly
1/1	I would recommend the vaccine if you haven‚Äôt got it just so we could get back to normal :)
0/0	I would refuse to take the Coronovirus vaccine if it has the Microchip and Nanobots in it. These would control you and make you docile. Wake up forks.
1/1	I would roll my sleeve up for the vaccine today if it were available.
1/1/1	I would say anybody is mandatory vaccination to go to work, travel, school. End of the pandemic and free shots for everybody
1/1	I would say it is MORE safe than a traditional vaccine. This isn't entirely accurate an explanation but close enough: A traditional vaccine either carries a weakened or inert virus. Your immune system recognizes it, and attacks it, but because it is either a weakened version nor an inert one, you don't actually get sick. Now that your body knows what the invader looks like, when it sees it again it can attack it much more quickly and you don't get sick. The two methods currently available for covid vaccine take a different approach. The virus contains a specific protein that allows it to enter your cells and attack it. The vaccine has a piece of genetic code that tells your cells to create this protein. Your immune system then sees that protein and attacks it. Like the other approach, now when it sees the protein on the actual virus, it know how to attack it and kills the protein much quicker. Without the protein, the virus is unable to infect your cells and eventually dies. So two benefits: The vaccine doesn't actually contain the virus itself Because your immune system attacks the protein and not the virus, the virus can mutate to some degree and you will still be immune. So from what I see, this is a far superior approach and safer. The allergic reactions that are being reported seem to be related to peoples fish and egg allergies which are ingredients used in the vaccine, but I've not seen a conclusive report on this yet
1/1	I would say the main reason would be the inadequacy of the vaccination process. Not nearly enough people are vaccinated to gain much benefit
1/1	I would say yes most definitely, I have unfortunately not taken vaccines yet because my first vaccine I took caused me to have a 5 hour seizure and almost die but yes I would strongly recommend to take the Covid vaccine when I comes out for the safety of you and others.
0/0	I would stay away from this shot as it will reprogram you cells and your body will create a protein very similar to that in the covid19. Your body will constantly make it and you can never detox this out of your system like regular vaccines. So in the future, when your body comes across another coronavirus like a cold or a mutated strain of covid, your body will not see it as an intruder in your system and will not create antibodies to fight it. All of the animals, in the short amount of testing they've done on them, have died. so they suspended testing on animals and went straight to humans.
1/1	I would support vaccination being on the mandatory list for schools once kids are allowed to get it. Antinvaxxers can homeschool.
1/1	I would take 10 rounds of vaccine if necessary
1/1	I would take AstraZeneca if I was offered it.
1/1	I would take any of them, except SINOVAC
1/1	I would take infinite amount of boosters if it will keep me away of lockdowns and spreading viruses
1/1	I would take it. It will be a year since I saw my family and uk friends soon. I need to travel. No idea what the situation will be for ex pats like me? Do we get offered a vaccine here or do I have to go back to the uk to get one and put myself at risk in the process?
1/1/1/1	I would take the COVID vaccine and I would do it as soon as possible. Reason is that the virus is picking up mutations and the efficacy against new variants maybe reduced. The vaccine will have to be modified and if you miss this round you may have to wait a while.
1/1/1	I would take the COVID vaccine and I would do it as soon as possible. Reason is that the virus is picking up mutations and the efficacy against new variants maybe reduced. The vaccine will have to be modified and if you miss this round you may have to wait a while. It‚Äôs probably better to take this now and have protection. And take the next one next year when it‚Äôs available.
1/1	I would take the Covid vaccine for free! In fact, I would PAY to take it! Covid 19 could kill me if I catch it. The strong motivation to take it, and even have to pay to take it, is already there.
1/1	I would take the vaccine, even with all the conspiracy stories I hear about with how ‚Äúfake‚Äù the virus is and how the vaccine just wants to ‚Äúpatent‚Äù our DNA.
1/1	I would translate this video for free in Arabic, our culture suffer from sharing conspiracy theories!
1/-1	I would wait for one of the two superior ones unless I had a job that required in person work.
0/-1	I would wait until some studies of the long term effects it can have.
1/1	I would, if I could get one!
1/1	I would, too, to get vaccinated; however, here in Southern California our doctor‚Äôs office doesn‚Äôt have the vaccine, the pharmacy don‚Äôt have the vaccine and trying to get an appointment with LA county health department takes hours and then once you have the appointment and wait in line for hours they run out! So yeah cheer all you want about how easy and painless it is while the rest of us wait and wait and wait.
1/1	I would. I find the risks to be acceptable. Also, my #1 fear with covid isn't that I'll get sick, it's that I will give it to my vulnerable family members, or vulnerable people in the community. I would never forgive myself if I skipped out on a safe covid vaccine and then gave covid to someone who died or had serious complications.
1/1	I would. Waiting for sign off by my oncologist but I‚Äôm s/p allogenic BMT after being diagnosed with ALL in 2016. I have been following up with some ID mentors and they all think the data is very promising and don‚Äôt see any major red flags as of yet. I realize there‚Äôs a lot more to come but I have been scared shitless working as a hospitalist with multiple vented and ICU patients with COVID despite appropriate PPE.
0/0	I wouldn't be giving the vaccine to my kids. Bad enough that I got the jab myself.
0/0/0/0	I wouldn't be so skeptical but bill gates is involved in the vaccine. He is banned for putting birth control in vaccines in Africa. He gave talks a month before the By virus came out saying next pandemic will be a corona virus....just too coincidental. He is also on tape talking about population control-!
0/0/0/0	I wouldn't get this vaccine no way done in 8 months!!! MUMPS TOOK 4YRS..
0/0	I wouldn't give this vaccine to my dog never mind me.
1/1	I wouldn't go near him for treatment as I wouldn't trust him when not being vacinated
0/0	I wouldn't have that shit pumped into my body regardless
0/-1	I wouldn't mind getting yearly shot but I had a reaction to both shots and I really don't wanna keep going through that unless I absolutely have to. I hate missing weeks of work.
0/-1	I wouldn't say it's "safe", all biological therapies carries a risk, and that's the first thing they should know. The thing is, covid vaccine is rushed asf.
0/0	I wouldn't take a Covid jab.
0/0	I wouldn't take a vaccine that hasn't been authorized by the NHS.
0/0/0/0	I wouldn't take any vaccine or any medication that was exempt from Criminal litigation as a result of damage to the recipient.
0/0	I wouldn't take it. The body heals it self. If they attempt to force anything on me, trust me, we will have a BIG PROBLEM.
0/0	I wouldn't trust coronavirus vaccine
1/1	I wouldn't want you taking care of me in a hospital if you're a HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL and still refuse it. What, exactly, is it that is stopping you? What, precisely, is in that vaccine or what about is the reason you're not taking it? I imagine you'll ignore my question like every single other antivax person who just avoids it because they, like you, don't know.
1/1	I wouldn't worry, every immune response is different does not mean it is not working...my wife also had a huge reaction to her shingles shot, but very little to no reaction to either shot of the pfizer vaccine...
0	I wouldn‚Äôt get this vaccine if they paid me a million dollars!!
0/0	I wouldn‚Äôt let my pet take that vaccination. Lol y‚Äôall crazy!
0/0	I wouldn‚Äôt put that poison in my body for any amount of money, and I am going on 75! Too many deaths from the vaccine that they don‚Äôt want out! I was hearing yesterday that the deaths from the vaccine are being listed as Covid deaths! I shudder at this vaccine...long term effects not known!
0/0	I would‚Äôve never gotten vaccinated if I had realized the extent to which vaccinated can carry and spread the virus. Without limiting infection, there‚Äôs no point for young healthy people who aren‚Äôt at risk to Covid (especially those with prior infection like me)
1/1	I' m so happyyyyy! My dad has an appointment for vaccination against covid!
1/1	I' ve got my 1st shot of Moderna Vaccine.
0/1	I'LL PASS CRAZY DUDE
1/1	I'M DOING MY PART!

0/-1	I'am not getting the shots! PERIOD!
0/0	I'am not getting the shots! PERIOD! There some flake one out there, and people are coming down with side effect TOO> WAY TO EARLY TO GET EM ~ I'am not going to be there Guinea Pigs
0/0	I'am rolling with what works and it does not include a vaccine. What are people going to do when they start dropping dead in the streets in a year or 2?
1/1	I'd absolutely get it. I just finished chemo last month and live in a COVID hotspot.
1/1	I'd absolutely get it. I just finished chemo last month and live in a COVID hotspot. Honest question, does anyone know of any factual or evidence-based reasons to be concerned about an mRNA vaccine that isn't just theoretical? I understand it may be too early to know. But I am much too far out from molecular biology to remember all of it.
1/1	I'd ask why anyone would be dumb enough to do that in the first place, but...well they are anti-vaxxers.
0/0	I'd be dead before I take that vaccine. Actually, I'd not even let my corpse take it.
1/1	I'd bet the correlation between the vaccine skeptics and financial inadequacy is through the roof for any given cohort of people. In short, the stupidest portion of any group of people are the ones most skeptical of the vaccines.
1/1	I'd definitely get the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccines, assuming they release data and it checks out (including safety data). Widespread vaccination could end this pandemic and save hundreds of thousands of lives. I may be low risk myself, but I have a responsibility to society. Not just as a physician, but as a person.
1/1	I'd definitly recommend it if you have access to corona vaccine!
0/0	I'd feel a lot more comfortable if some long term testing had been carried out.
1/-1	I'd like our govts to focus on health care, health care staff supports and $, and a streamlined effort to keep covid under control. This is likely to include vaccination at border crossings.
1/1	I'd like to be vaccinated. I'm en expat living in Vietnam, do I have any chances to get a vaccine Sputnik here?:)
0/0	I'd like to remind everyone that covid vaccine companies are released from liability for vaccines. You are on your own when something happens, you are the one who will bear consequences
1/1	I'd like to thank the US & Germany for making an effective and necessary vaccine with the speed of light. Just got my Pfizer shot today and I just keep hearing good news. Thanks so much, from Canada
1/1	I'd like to thank you for sharing this information with everyone. It was interesting to learn about the vaccine process.
1/1	I'd like to think this will finally put the doubts about this vaccine to bed, partially with our continental neighbours.. But I'm not hold my breath.
0/0	I'd like to wait 2 years for it.
0/0/1/0	I'd love to see another video with both of you getting the vaccine and then reporting a day a week later how your feeling
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I'd love to see the people who developed these vaccines and their families lining up to get them first, in droves. Where are the studies? Where is the transparency?
0/0	I'd might take it if it wasn't a RNA vaccine. I don't have a lot of contact to people and especially not to risk groups atm, so i don't see it as a necessity. Due to both my parents working in the medical sector i'm not that fond of new pharmaceutical products because sometimes (light or heavy) side effects can occur that were missed in the testing phase. Especially with an RNA vaccine i'd rather be careful in the beginning than sorry afterwards. I feel like a lot of people are too based on emotion instead of assessing the situation based on facts because of how the first stages of the outbreak went and how bad that was managed in many places. Just keep your masks on, keep your distance and stay at home if you're feeling sick. The situation we have now is because people can't follow the rules and a vaccine won't mean that this situation will be over within a month
1/1	I'd much rather have the vaccine than have this virus.
1/1	I'd much rather take those side effects then get covid.
1/1	I'd rather believe the scientists than your facebook conspiracies, to be honest.
0/0	I'd rather catch Covid 30 times than take a dose of vaccine every few months that proved its not effective and furthermore potentially dangerous since it's not examined enough
0/0	I'd rather catch covid than allow a jab rewrite my immune system. This is NOT a vaccine.
0/0	I'd rather escape and life alone somewhere in the Forests than giving away my precious DNA
1/1	I'd rather get Johnson vaccine. One shot is better than two
0/0	I'd rather get the virus than this vaccine. The virus isn't as bad as they make out.
1/0	I'd rather have autism than measles, thank you very much!
0/0	I'd rather have my immune system take Cate of covid instead of this man made junk.
1/1	I'd rather have the side effects from the vaccine than covid.
0/0	I'd rather inject myself with runnypoo
0/0	I'd rather my kid got covid, recover, and be immune. Than risk their health on a "vax"
0/0	I'd rather not get the vaccine, either.
1/1	I'd rather risk a Covid-19 vaccine side effect as opposed to actually getting covid-19
1/1	I'd rather roll the dice with unknown long term effects than getting COVID.
0/0	I'd rather swallow disinfectants.
0/0	I'd rather take a mixed cocktail from Bill Cosby than a vaccine made by Bill Gates. Don't take it.
0/0	I'd rather take my chances on not getting it.
0/0	I'd rather take my chances with Covid19 with a survival rate of 99.6% I think I'll be fine, and if you've had a vaccine you shouldn't be able to get Covid so me being vaccinated or not should have zero affect on you're lifes because if you take the vaccine and can stil catch it then what was the purpose of the vaccine in the 1st place.
1/1	I'd say 90% of the people that I know that have been vaccinated were barely affected. I had a sore arm for 24 hours after the first one. That was it.
1/1	I'd say that in a pandemic common sense should be in play. Get vaccinated.
0/0	I'd sooner trust a pack of hungry wolves than Big Pharma.
0/0	I'd still rather risk the actual virus.
0/0/0	I'd trust an email from a Nigerian Prince before a Bill Gates vaccine.
0/0	I'll ask big pharma if vaccines are safe.
1/1	I'll be adding 1 to these numbers soon. Getting my first Pfizer shot on Tuesday. I preferred J&J for a number of reasons but after weeks of trying and failing to get an appt I decided to just go with what was available. Gotta drive an hour an a half, 80 miles away in the next county over, missing a day of work but I'll do whatever it takes to put this year of hell behind me.
0/0	I'll be avoiding the vaccine unless I have to have a damned "vaccine passport" to live "normally"
0/0	I'll be dead before I voluntarily accept your vaccine.
1/1/1	I'll be first in line for this vaccine!
1/1	I'll be getting my first shot soon! I decided when the vaccine rollout began that I would get vaccinated without any hesitation, when it was my time to do so, and not BEFORE it was my time to do!

1/1	I'll be getting the vaccine as soon as possible so that I can make sure I'm protecting the people that I'm forced to interact with at the grocery and otherwise as well as their families.
1/0	I'll be happy to get the vaccine as soon as Bill Gates prove to me he got it. By the way who is this unintelligent buffoon you have on your show very disappointed.
0/1	I'll be happy too, right after you shove your masks and vaccines straight up your backside.
1/1	I'll be one of em when I get my second shot on wednesday!
1/1	I'll be one of the last to get it but I have 0 problems with that. That are many who needs it before me. I'm just excited we have a little light at the end of this long dark tunnel.
0/0/-1/0	I'll be one of your challenges. I respectfully decline your offer of medical treatment. Thank you.
1/1	I'll be singing My Shot once this thing is out and available in my country!
1/1	I'll be taking it happily
1/1	I'll be there right beside you, Hank! See you in the vaccine line!
1/1	I'll bet that many anti-vax'ers would change their minds if insurance companies stopped paying hospitalization and related fees when they and their family contract Covid. All of our insurance premiums are paying for anti-vax'ers , AKA Republicans! Where is the outrage!!!
0/0	I'll definitely get fired before I put worthless poison in my body lol
0/0	I'll die fighting for freedom, but I won't die from taking the vaccine !!!!!!!

0/0	I'll have a more severe reaction to the vaccine than I ever would with the virus, so why get the vaccine?
1/1	I'll have anytime any where given the chance. No hesitation.
1/1	I'll have my vaccine next Thursday, can't wait! What about the side effects you ask? Go read up on the side effects of covid 19, I hear the most common one is death!! I'll take my chances with the wee jab in my arm, backed by thousands of experts and scientists rather than risk catching covid!
0/0	I'll have the vaccine - when it's been around a lot longer and all the side effects are known
0/0	I'll have to add this to the list of shots I don't get every year.
0/0	I'll hold off until all the beta testing has been completed and a true body count issued.

0/0	I'll pass. Vaccines nowadays are more dangerous than the virus
1/1	I'll probably do it as soon as it is avaiable for me. I'm neiter a person-at-risk, nor someone that often comes in contact with this group, so I expect I'll have to wait quite a while.

1/1	I'm "almost" ready to get this vaccine
1/1/-1/-1	I'm "almost" ready to get this vaccine, however, I have a question that I'm hoping you can answer. If our own cells are making the spike protein - which causes the body to attack - isn't that be definition an autoimmune response? How are we going to prevent this vaccine from causing autoimmune response, i.e., the body attacking our own cells (which are making this spike protein)?
1/1	I'm 15, so I legally can't get any Vaccines until I'm 16 (in like 7 more months). I hate my life.
1/1	I'm 16 years old, and I have taken the Pfizer vaccine. I didn't have any side effects on my first shot, but I did have a sore arm for the second shot. The pain disappeared a day after taking paracetamol.
1/1	I'm 19. I just received my first Pfizer Vaccine, second coming in two weeks
1/1	I'm 21 and when the vaccines arrived at the beginning I just went to the clinic without an appointment and got my shots. I havent experienced any side effects.
1/1	I'm 22 turning 23 this month I've already had first shot of the vaccine they made me wait 15 mins before leaving and its already been a week or so I've been moving around in the heat sweating the days away working and cutting grass still and haven't had any side effects yet!!!üòÖ
1/1	I'm 24, fit and healthy - I literally coughed blood when I got COVID. Do yourself a favour and just get vaccinated!
1/1	I'm 26 and I still feel tired and out of breath everyday, this a few months after I got covid. Not saying what you're saying isn't true, but I don't wish that on anyone so everyone please get the vaccine and stay healthy!
1/1	I'm 28 and healthy and got my first dose yesterday! I work with the public though. My arm is very sore but I'm so relieved.
0	I'm 30 days out from my first dose of Covishield. The maker does NOT recommend waiting 4 MONTHS for 2nd dose. When can I get mine?
1/1	I'm 31 years old and just got vaccinated a few months ago. Go us OP!
1/1	I'm 33 n have had no health issues whatsoever and I'll be 1st in line to get the vaccine when I'm able. For myself but more so for others.
1/1	I'm 33 year old and want the vaccine. When the demand for eligible participants are low, why can't we loosen the criteria for general population? This is precious medication sitting idle.
1/1	I'm 40, and I'll get it in a heartbeat the second I'm allowed to. Also, let's please please please open up vaccinations to daycare workers, they are so important to supporting everyone
1/1	I'm 43, clinically extremely vulnerable and I get my first vaccine tomorrow! I'm a bit nervous only because I've been shielding since March and I shall be nervous being around other people, for fear of catching the virus.
1/1	I'm 50 had the AstraZeneca jab two weeks ago & I will be going for my second one in June. Thank you for this video very interesting as always.
0/0	I'm 50 with fair health. I'll take my chances with the virus. Its fear porn. No, I will not take the vaccine. Even if its mandated. I'll order my food and stay home. I have done it 9 months. What is another year.
1/1/1	I'm 54 and had my first jab 4 weeks ago and the second one is due on 5 June. I've had to travel 15 miles for both but I feel incredibly lucky to have been given this opportunity. I advise everyone to book even if it may be inconvenient
0/0	I'm 60 and smoke and I was going to get it but I've seen a ton more stuff, they cant see, bad jurking, something is very dark about this. They have been trying for 20 yrs to get this made, all the animals ... shaking my head from left to right ....
1/1	I'm 62 and got my poke exactly one week and 10 hours ago. I have to this day, not had any adverse effects at all. I felt a little weird after the shot for a few minutes when I realized I hadn't had lunch yet, then I ate lol. Oh, my arm was a little sore for about an hour after I went back to work but ceased soon. The only effects that I may have encountered is my sense of hearing and smell seemed to be a bit better ( But then again it may be just in my head, he he). Just be aware if you feel weird for an extended period, it couldn't hurt to see a Doc. Good luck all, we will get through this!!!
1/1	I'm 66 years in USA, I was required by law, as a child to have every vaccination of value for young children. Then I was vaccinated the hell out of when I joined the US Navy in boot camp. I've had tetanus shots, pneumonia shots, shingles, flu shots the last 10 years. I'm as perfectly healthy and more so than others my age or even younger. So,,, F you, you anti-vaccination aholes! Stop being dicks!
1/1	I'm 70 tomorrow (Wednesday) & get my jag on Thursday. Everyone I speak to, whether in the city or in rural Ayrshire, very impressed with the whole vaccination process.
1/1	I'm 71 disabled housebound, got asthma, COPD and sleep apnea and i am terrified that I will die before I get vaccinated....are you
1/-1	I'm Asian. I live in LA. I will get the vaccine when I think the timing is right.
0/0	I'm NEVER going to get the vaccine because I'm vaccine injured and also have allergies.
0/0	I'm NoT GeTTiN iT cAuSe I'm heALthy
1/1/1/1	I'm PRO-vaccine, was vaccinated, healthy, and alive. Go, Doctor Baldwin!!! We're with you!
0/0	I'm THE only person that decides what goes into my body.
0/0	I'm TRANS Vaccinated!!!! I'm not actually Vaccinated But i do IDENTIFY as someone who is Vaccinated
1/1	I'm Vaccinated because I Love My Neighbor as well as My Self!
0	I'm Very Lucky. My Creator gave Me a Damn Good Immune System. Sorry about Your problem
1/1	I'm a 60-year-old guy. I belong to one of the population's most at-risk groups. I would probably take vaccine
0/0	I'm a 68 year old white woman and I have no plans to take the vaccine until it is closer to 99.9% safe. And the way people in charge of the vaccine want to give it out to Non White People first I would be really cautious about taking to shot first based on the color of skin.
1/1	I'm a Nurse and got Covid before the vaccine was released to the public. I plan to get the J&J vaccine this week. I SO DO NOT want to ever get Covid again. It was awful!!
1/1	I'm a big fan of vaccines, they are the single greatest medical achievement.
0/0	I'm a bit concerned about a new company pushing a new treatment as quick as possible. I think it would be best to not immediately use this on a massive scale until years of treatments have been studied.
0/0	I'm a bit vaccin skeptic for me personally there's no incentive to take it, I called the Corona information number from the government to ask what the difference was between getting the virus and being vaccinated against the virus. The woman on the phone actually lied to me. She said that some vaccines are 95% effective and therefore protect for longer‚Ä¶
1/1	I'm a doctor and I knew this would happen long before the vaccine was made. If you give something like this to millions and six people die it's a remarkably good and safe medication.
1/1	I'm a first responder and I can't wait for the vaccine.
1/1/1/1	I'm a first responder and our department is submitting the number of vaccine doses we need on this Friday, so hopefully we"ll be getting them next week, but it may be a but longer. I'm super ready and excited to be getting the vaccinated.
1/-1	I'm a frontline critical key worker, went in for the vaccine, was very nervous about it. After 20 minutes I had a horrible wave of chills and started sweating out, I felt my pulse and it was scary low and the weather was -5c üòÇ after that initial symptom went away, I was okay for the rest of the day but still anxious
1/1	I'm a frontline healthcare worker and plan on doing the same and sharing it on Facebook. Not because I want attention, but because I want to help reassure people and help dispel any false ideas people have regarding the vaccine.
1	I'm a fully vaccinated type 1 diabetic in my 30s, pretty active, etc. I just got over what I think was an omicron infection...it was like a mild to moderate cold. I know several other people who got it, most had a relatively similar experience although one lady had a fever as well. All were young and vaccinated. Hopefully this thing burns through quickly and brings a quick end to this pandemic (ever the optimist lol)
0/0	I'm a happy anti-vaxxer, the vaccine is more dangerous than covid it self
1/1/1/1	I'm a healthcare worker and I have my appointment to get it on Friday! I'm so excited.
1/1	I'm a hospital worker in Maine and our vaccination rounds begin tomorrow
1/1	I'm a little worried about long term side effects as it's a new vaccine but as a healthcare worker I trust the science and I'll probably be first in line anyway.
1/1	I'm a med student starting my clinical rotations in January. I'm waiting on absolute tenterhooks for that needle!!
0/0/0/0	I'm a nice guy. Someone else can have my dose ;)
1/1	I'm a nurse and I'm getting my first dose of Moderna tomorrow.
1/1	I'm a nurse and I'm getting my first dose of Moderna tomorrow...I'm a little nervous, simply because the flu shot usually causes me fatigue and joint pain and I just hate feeling poorly. Hopefully side effects won't be severe.
0/-1	I'm a nurse and no solution in needle and no aspiration of barrel .what is going on??? trickery!!!we don't fall for this mess!!!!
1/1	I'm a physician and America's successful vaccine rollout is bittersweet following my frustration with how the previous administration and a sizable amount of our general public responded to COVID-19 and common decency measures like mask wearing and social distancing. The vaccine rollout is a point of pride for me as a proud American, but I hope our successful vaccine manufacture and distribution will allow us to contribute to vaccination in less wealthy countries, particularly our neighbors in Central and South America.
0/0	I'm a pilot in europe, unvaccinated against covid. I've had so much exposure to this virus while traveling, staying in hotel etc. I had a symptomatic response to the delta strain. I still have antibodies nearly a year after infection. I'm not afraid of this virus, but I am afraid of how hysterical people are about it.
0/0/0	I'm a pro-Lifer, and I'm not talking about abortion. I am against bioweapons including the covid genetic-manipulation delivery system often (intentionally) mislabeled as a vaccine.

1/1/1/1/1/1	I'm a republican but I believe in the science of modern medicine and I have faith in the science behind the physiology of the human body as well as the science behind the vaccine anti vaxers are just plain stupid ;\
0/0	I'm a second year paediatric nurse. I'm worried that I've chosen the wrong profession. I really do not want the vaccination. üòû
0/0	I'm a student in high school who's one of many getting asked to leave my school for not being vaccinated. I feel like I'm losing my friends and education I worked for. This is starting with private school and in my opinion will most likely go to public schools. This is messed up on so many levels, I have no clue what I will do now. This is stepping out of line and can ruin a kids life.
1/1	I'm a teacher and just made an appointment for my first corona vaccine!
1/0	I'm a teacher. Im an anti vaxer
1/1	I'm a teacher. They need to fast track the hell out of this. If our kids are vaccinated, we can go back to school in person without risking our kids or their families
1/1	I'm a trucker. I'm pro vaccine. These protests are making me ashamed to do my job.
1/1	I'm a trucker. I'm pro vaccine. These protests are making me ashamed to do my job. I head out today to do a trip to L.A.. I'm dreading it. I hate that my job makes me associated with this.
0	I'm a very healthy person, I had never been hospitialized and I was hesitant to get the vaccine, but I travel a lot. I got the vaccine with horrible side effects. I'm out of breathing every time I work out. I regretted getting it.
0/0	I'm a white Ph.D. Aerospace Engineer and I have no plans to take the vaccine. In my mind as I am healthy and in my 50's I think at this time the potential risk outweighs the benefit.
1/1	I'm a-ok with self isolation so I can probably hold off for a bit to make sure people who need it get one. I work from home and have introverted hobbies.
1/1/1/1	I'm about to take the vaccine
1/1	I'm about to take the vaccine üôÜüèæ‚ôÇÔ∏è
1/1	I'm actually going to take the vaccine today
0/0	I'm affraid of the vax, rather than the Covid itself
0/-1	I'm afraid people have more sense than they think
0/0	I'm afraid the masses will not be awoken. They do no research. They have been made so fearful and anxious by the constant bombardment from the MSM, that they have lost the ability to reason. They could vaccinate them every month and still they'd queue up for it, placid & grateful
0/0	I'm against this Vaccination because is the least of what to do right now
0/0	I'm against untested medications which offer me no benefits because I have natural immunity. The risk/reward would be non-existent for me to take this shite.
0/-1	I'm aged 18-59 ‚Äî we were told not to get AstraZeneca
1/1	I'm all for it. If I go to the pub, first, I want to see the vax-passports of the servers and the kitchen people.
1/1/1/1/1/1	I'm all for safety, but damn, we need those vaccines now. Wish there was a voluntary system where people who wanted to take the vaccine could.
1/1	I'm all for the passport. And I'm all for anti Vax nutjobs protesting it. Setting up a situation where the these people self remove themselves from interacting with me sounds great.
1/0	I'm all for the vaccine if it's safe, well tested, and NOT FORCED
1/1	I'm all for the vacine.
0/0	I'm all for tried, tested and proven vaccines, however the covid vaccination is none of these. Nor does it stop you from getting or spreading the virus.
1/1	I'm all for vaccines
1/1	I'm allergic to eggs and I finally this year was able to find someone who'd give me a flu shot. I felt a little flushed for a few minutes afterwards, but that's it. Much less than the side effect my family suffered of having to put up with me for another year.
1/1	I'm allergic to penicillin. Because a small percentage of people like me could die from it, by your logic should we ban this life saving drug? I had a horrible reaction to the AZ vaccine. But I would have taken it again as COVID is much, much worse.
1/1	I'm almost 50. got two Pfizer and one booster from Moderna. I went to gym 4 times a week and play basketball there. never caught the virus. With the contacts I have daily, I believe the vaccine worked.
1/1	I'm also getting the vaccine and recommend everybody who can get it to get it, including my parents.
0/0	I'm also in NY and not getting it unless I'm forced to. If an employer asks why it took so long, I'll just make shit up about how I was depressed due to lockdowns and couldn't bring myself to go outside. Ezpz
0/0	I'm also not taking the vaccine, we've had many deadly diseases which still doesn't have vaccine
1/1	I'm also vaccinated because I don't want to get really sick or die
0/0	I'm an "antivaxxer" the same way I'm a "terf". It's a lazy, social shaming slur weaponized by primarily the left to shut down any meaningful discourse, dismiss valid safety concerns, silence the victims of dangerous ideologies & is a convenient excuse to avoid doing any research.
1/1	I'm an Icu nurse and we still have alot of patients like Christopher. It seems like they are getting younger now and they end up dying. When did vaccine get to be a dirty word? I have seen a few people who were vaccinated end up on a ventilator but most are the unvaccinated. I think a life is more important than arguing about the vaccine. I have seen rare adverse reactions to the flu shot, like guillane barret,but nothing from the covid vaccine, that I am aware of anyway.
0	I'm an anti-vaxxer. I watched my child suffer from seizures after being given a series of vaccinations.
1/1	I'm an essential worker at a hotel (front desk). Last time I got sick, I had a fever over 103 and got pneumonia. And yet, it's still somehow not my turn here in San Diego County... :(
0/0	I'm an organic chemist and I spent most of my time in graduate school synthesizing delivery vehicles to get oligonucleotides INTO cells. Absolutely no way would I take an mRNA vaccine!
0/0	I'm anti anything thats being FORCED on the public!
0/0	I'm anti government, anti system, anti a lot of things, not anti vax. But in this particular case, i'm not taking the vaccine. I don't want things to go "back to normal". I want things to become better. So this is my form of protest kind of (i'm in Germany)
0/0	I'm anti-Biden and I won't be taking the vaccine
0/0	I'm anti-Vax and proud!
1/1/1/1	I'm anti-seatbelt because I can still die or be injured in a car accident.
0/0	I'm anti-vaccine and im proud to be i regret doing any vaccine
1/0	I'm as pro-vaccination as they come, but I don't think there's ever been a vaccine so rushed as the one for Covid-19, if anything it feels more like a sort of arms race to who can develop a functional vaccine the quickest. Obviously I get why it's being rushed in the first place, but I am REALLY not going to rush to be the first one to get it.
0/0	I'm at doctor now and he was pretty pushy about getting vaccine. I just said,I'm here for my blood pressure meds. He almost convinced me.
1/1	I'm at the point where I just don't care about hearing these stories. I'm fully vaccinated with the booster and alive.
0	I'm avoiding this possible poison as long as I can but I'm sure there are ways to make me and others that agree take the vaccine (or whatever the hell it is), they're ready for us
0/-1	I'm being forced by my company to take the vaccine
0/0	I'm being pressured to get boosters every 3 months and I'm hesitant to take it so often
1/1	I'm blessed to be vaccinated as I just recovered from COV in 7 day without severity symptom. My mom full vaccinated with booster 65 this year is lucky enough to recover from COV just 3 days. I think is better get vaccination least reduce the severity symptom like pneumonia as may damage your lung or worse...
0/0	I'm boosting my immune system naturally by taking vitamin D and eating healthy i wont be taking a rushed vaccine
0	I'm certainly glad most of those out there who have taken the vaccine are leftist libt@rds. Soon this site will be virtually void of all of you and your painful ignorance.
0/0	I'm concerned about the long term side-effects of vaccines.
1/1	I'm confident in the development process of the vaccines today.
1/1	I'm conservative and my wife is on dialysis in a center with people from nursing homes. They asked her if she wanted the vaccine. Shes pretty scared about it because it's new and shes worried about future kidney transplants. I've seen what fellow Republicans say about the pandemic and vaccine, but I've also seen what they have said about January 6th. I told her to get the vaccine....
0/0	I'm crying my mom got vaccinated and she has had numerous issues ever since one specifically vision it seems that the ailments that one had previous to vacine is brought to forefront
1/1	I'm curious to know if you feel that there has been enough time to pass to see if there are any long term side effects to the Covid 19 vaccine. it doesn't seem to me that enough time has passed to really find out if there are any side effects. But I'm all for the vaccine, especially if it will save millions of lives.
1/1	I'm currently working a vaccination site on the east coast. We do about 2,000+ vaccinations a day. I worked at a site last month that did 3,000+ a day. And this is just one of hundreds of mass vaccination sites. We're gonna knock this out
1/1	I'm definitely more scared of covid and would do it yearly if I had to.
0/0	I'm definitely not taking it...warp speed my ass
0/0	I'm definitely not taking this vaccine. It's scary.
1/1/1/1	I'm definitely taking it
1/1/1	I'm delighted there are no antivaxers in the comment section.
0/-1	I'm disabled, living in low income housing and I tell you I've talked to people here who have gotten the shots and they have felt tired, pain/swelling at the shot site, flu like for symptoms!!
0/0	I'm don't want to get the second jab of AstraZeneca because I'm worried about blood clot issue
1/1	I'm done reading non sense. You can die of covid 19. Vaccine it is for me!
1/0	I'm double vaxed & boostered - tested positive NYE Day after having a scratchy throat/runny nose for a few days. So glad it never got worse and I didn't spread it to my teen daughter or hubby (I have no doubt it's because of the vaccines/boosters we all got).
1/1	I'm due my second Pfizer vaccine soon as I'm a key worker working in a pharmacy. I'm doing it to protect my mother who has COPD. She was proud of me for getting it done. the only symptom I had was fatigue, I Fell asleep half an hour after getting home from my appointment.
1/1	I'm enjoying seeing the "what if one of the 6/7,000,000 cases was you" responses about the vaccine now while most of the same people spent the last year touting the 99% survival rate number to justify doing whatever they please
1/1	I'm excited to get my 1st COVID shot later today!! It's one step closer to normalcy!
1/1	I'm extremely excited and hoping to get it soon
1/1	I'm extremely paranoid and would be more than happy to get a vaccine if it meant I wouldn't die.
1/1	I'm far from an anti-vaccer
1/1	I'm fine with another shot if that what it takes.
1/1	I'm fine with getting a third but I really wish they could get the approval for children to have the vaccine.
1/0	I'm fine with it. More vaccine for those who need it.
1/1	I'm for vaccines and I took them all!!
1/1	I'm from Canada and because of the vaccine shortage we just have to take what we are given and be happy and I think most of us are but it's nice to know that all brands are effective. Can't wait until I'm eligible!
1/1	I'm from India, I remember the time when polio was so rampant and many kids were left paralyzed. Because most of the kids infected with polio were from poor families the vaccine was provided at a very cheap and affordable rate 1 re ( I'm not very sure of this amount it happened ages ago) This helped eradicate polio from India. The risk of your child getting sick because of a vaccine is so much more lower than your child getting measles and whopping cough. You most probably have gotten vaccinated and so have I and we both turned out fine. You have the opportunity to save your kids, Do it. Your kids will be in pain if they contract diseases that have already been eradicated by a cure.
1/1	I'm from Moscow, Russia. I vaccinated last weak. I' m feeling fine and so are my friends. I believe that vaccination is the best thing to do in this case. Wish you all good health!!!!!

1/1	I'm fully vaccinated and anyone who is skeptical should know they have being doing research on this since the SARS outbreak nearly 2 decades ago. Covid is a form of SARS. The first time my arm was just super sore for like 2 days and the second time I felt like I had the flu the next day but no arm soreness and no illness past the first day. My mom didn't get sick at all and my stepdad felt like me. I got Moderna.

1/1	I'm getting vaccinated because if I get covid it then won't hurt me very much. who in their right mind would not want to avoid hospitalization and maybe death and you just had to be vaccinated to do so? they should take a poll of those people who caught the virus after not being vaccinated and ask them 1> how sick did you get & 2> do you regret not being vaccinated?
1/1	I'm getting vaccinated on Wednesday!
1/1	I'm glad I got J&J yesterday. I'd hate to wait longer to be vaccinated just because there's a 0.00008% chance of developing blood clots
1/1	I'm glad I got the Pfizer vaccine
1/1	I'm glad I got the Pfizer vaccine over Johnson & Johnson.
0/0	I'm glad I have enough sense not to get the vaccine. Pray hard, eat right, wash your hands, wear a mask and keep it moving.
1/1	I'm glad I was able to ease your anxiety. You're going to be perfectly fine. There is no limit to how ridiculous the claims are that antivaxxers will make to scare people away from the vaccine.
0/0	I'm glad I wasn't in the experimental study
1/1	I'm glad I'm getting Moderna.
1/1	I'm glad I'm not the only one! I just turned 30 and volunteer at a nursing home and received the vaccine. Onward to herd immunity!
1/1	I'm glad I've already received both doses. I'm doing my part to end this pandemic.
0/0	I'm glad all my kids are grown but I feel sorry for parents with young kids who are being forced to get the experimental jab.
1/1	I'm glad people actually understand vaccines are not dangerous.
1/1	I'm glad someone realises that our economy won't get back to anything like normal until we have something approaching herd immunity which means people need to be vaccinated now- not later.
1/1	I'm glad that Novavax included so many over 65 in their trial, as this is a vulnerable group that will especially want a vaccine. Having good data on the efficacy and safety for this group seems particularly important.
0/0	I'm glad that my refusal to be vaccinated bothers you.....it warms my unvaccinated little heart.
1/1	I'm glad that this pandemic finally ends. I wanna get the vaccine as soon as possible.
1/1	I'm glad there are so many antivaxxers, it means more vaccine for me
1/1	I'm glad there are so many antivaxxers. It means more vaccine for me.
0/0	I'm glad there is so many people who believe this is full of BS cause I'm not getting the vaccine and people think I'm crazy. I never got the flu shot either and I didn't get sick. I have worked through covid and still see my family and friends. I'm not sick and they are not sick either. This is all about control and take away freedom and oppress people into slaves. Just one woman's opinion.
1/1	I'm glad there's a vaccine. Once people get the vaccine I want the mask wearing to end. Biggest lesson learned is don't let sick people in our country.
1/1	I'm glad they found a covid 19 vaccine but I'm also sad because school will open again
1/-1	I'm glad they're not taking the vaccine so darwinism takes place!! Love that !
1/1	I'm glad we are getting the vaccine out.
1/1	I'm going right now to take my jab !
1/-1	I'm going to be honest and frank here; sometimes you have to let people drown in their own foolishness and ignorance. If these patients still refuse to get vaccinated then hospitals ought refuse continue caring for them. Make them sign a waiver of their decision so there is no miss understanding. These folks are using up resources unnecessarily because of their ignorance and foolishness.
1/1	I'm going to be joining the Johnson & Johnson trial next week so hopefully that one works too
1/-1	I'm going to get vaccine soon and worry about side effects.
0/0	I'm going to not get it, but lie and say that I got it.
0/0	I'm going to risk being a healthy human that relies on my immune system. So far it has worked well for me. Ive been sick once in the last 20 years and ive had a grand total of 3 shots in my entire life- all before the age of 15.
0/0	I'm going to rush out and get my vaccine....never
0/0	I'm going to start discouraging people from taking the J&J vaccine. Too many problems.
1/1	I'm going to take it. I just want myself and family to be safe and alive, all that matters at this point.
1/1	I'm going to take it...its the prophesy coming tru this vaccine is the mark of the beast!
1/1	I'm going to wait to hear which vaccine the medcram guy ends up taking and then I'll take the same one.
0/0	I'm gonna be nice to my body and stay unvaxxed and stay unboostered. That way, me myself and I will get along.
1/1	I'm gonna get the vaccine on the 21st Pray for me..
1/1	I'm gonna get the vaccine to protect the people around me.
1/1	I'm gonna start my first vaccine this week
1/1	I'm gonna vaccine myself
0/0	I'm gonna wait a year or two because that vaccine was rushed and has to many problems right I and in all honesty would rather wait until it's been approved
0/0/0	I'm gonna wait till the 'human trials" are complete,absolute fookin insanity.
1/1	I'm good and thankful for them.Stop the spread ,get the shots NOW!"
0/0	I'm good y'all can skip me on that vaccine.
0/0/0/0	I'm good. My immune system is fine.
0/0	I'm good. You can have my covid vaccine along with my flu vaccine
0/0	I'm good... Kick me off that list please. hmu again in 5-10 years and then start from the beginning and try to convince me to take it but for now... Hard pass.
1/1	I'm grateful for vaccines, over the decades, that have saved so many lives. Thank you, Science
1/1	I'm grateful to have an opportunity to say thank you to one of the many that helped bring these vaccines to reality. From the bottom of my heart, thank you! This was all hands on deck in a global way. It's incredibly inspiring and is something that has helped me stay positive through the pandemic.
0/0	I'm guessing this has more to do with vaccines being rushed than anything else. I remember feeling the same way about the talks of early vaccines because I didn't think they'd be testing enough
1/1	I'm happy for the people who don't want the jab. It means the rest of us move up the queue faster.
1/1	I'm happy that people are really trying so hard to save our lives and we are really thankful for this amazing news may we all be healthy and safe
1/1	I'm happy that there is so many people that want to be vaccinated. My family just got our first shots for those of us who are eligible. My younger brother is the only person in the house too young to get vaccinated yet. I'm looking forward to being able to get some semblance of normal back
1/1	I'm happy to get a booster! This is a life or death fight people. 39,000 children and teens got covid last week.
1/1	I'm happy to get a vaccine that is FDA approved and provides eradication of a deadly virus....
1/1	I'm happy to live in such a modern tech society. With vaccines, internet/information.
1/1/1/1	I'm happy to report that I received my second dose of the Moderna vaccine last Wednesday and I only had one day of feeling a bit crummy. All is well and I am now up-to-date on my vaccinations. ‚Å£
1/-1	I'm happy to wait. Keeps distance anyway.
1/1	I'm happy with that as long as it works. It's pretty much what I had expected. We need annual flu shots. why should we expect this would be different?!
0/0	I'm happy with the way my DNA already works thanks. I dont want anything to change it.
0/-1	I'm having a hard time believing that the vaccine is helpful. I'm an average civilian with only a foundation in holistic living. The doctors on those circles have different takeson this vaccine. Everyone has seemed to agree that it doesn't prevent spread. When people arecurrently still contracting this at varying degrees, it seems like the vaccine is really not doing anything. I'm happy to follow guidelines and will still get my booster when available, but i feel like it's just arbitrary. Also, we've found (at least from some things I've read) that antibacterial materials, etc (please excuse my ignorance) can lead to germs mutating. Where is the evidence that the vaccine didn't cause the virus to mutate, so that it stays alive. Not trying to be anti vax, but i want to understand better. To the naked eye out all seems like science just wants to appear like it's doing "something". Thank you.
0/0	I'm healthy I eat natural organic vegetables and fruits every day. I prefer the content of those as oppose to the injection. I imagine it will just disappear in a year or more and all of this will be overshadowed by something else.
0/0	I'm healthy so I'll pass on the vaccine
0/0	I'm hear to tell y'all the vaccines are useless,y wife had three vaccines and still caught the virus
0/1	I'm hearing that the vaccine causes people to react to radioactive isotopes in MRI's. Is this another anti-vaxx rumour...or?
0/1	I'm hesitant and I'm NOT an anti vaxxer, legit AM NOT and have gotten every single vaccine ever required but I don't think "Get the vaccine or lose your job" (which is starting, and I LOVE my job) is cool at all
0/0	I'm hosntaly asking anyone willing to answers what is the ethics behind
1/1	I'm immune compromised and I can't wait to be one of the first to get it!
0/0	I'm immuno compromised, and I believe that people should be allowed to refuse vaccinations for themselves, and their kids. I don't get vaccinations myself, and even if I was capable I still wouldn't
1/1	I'm immunocompromised, hypertensive I'm immunocompromised, hypertensive and have asthma, you bet your fucking arse I'll be taking it if and when it's offered.and have asthma, you bet I'll be taking it if and when it's offered.
1/1	I'm in England and had my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine this morning.
0/0	I'm in Healthcare and will not take the vaccine!
0/0	I'm in Oregon, I refuse to have the vaccine. You Californians have my full support if you don't want to have it either! ü§úü§õ
1/1	I'm in Tier 1C, when it's my turn, I'll take whatever is available, although I'm not too crazy about AstraZeneca.
1/1	I'm in a conference call in which two currently active meth addicts announced they "don't trust what's in the Covid-19 vaccine".
1	I'm in a high risk group and signed up to get the vaccine ASAP. I'm happy to take it. One thing that makes me angry is that at least in some jurisdictions, folks jump the line with claims that aren't true. "I am a daycare worker." (person is retired, watches grandchild once a week.) It just really gets to me. There are people who risk their lives, and you're jumping the line? ... .. yeah no I will not talk to you again.
1/1	I'm in favor of a vaccine passport. Not so much to make sure you're vaccinated although that's nice too. I just don't want to be around the type of person who is against vaccines. Let them self select right out of everything.
1/1	I'm in favor of taking the vax
0/0	I'm in no particular hurry
1/1	I'm in support of the vaccine, and seeing people be bullied for sharing their experiences in the covid vaccine subreddits (and general lack of compassion for those having a hard time with it) has been extremely disappointing. Shunning people talking about their side effects also prevents people who are scared/worried from building a support circle with others going through the same thing. Especially since there is so much uncertainty and fear about this new vaccine.
1/1/1	I'm in the Moderna trial and I feel Moderna is the best vaccine of all time, and Pfizer is right with Moderna.
1/1	I'm in the same boat as you. But im not selfish so I'm going to trust the experts on this one so I may not spread this virus.
1/1	I'm in the stats finally! Got my first shot of Pzifer yesterday. Really sore arm which is already better.
1/0	I'm interested in seeing the followup on your second dose. The second dose gave me all the side effects! Would still do it again tho 10/10!
1/1	I'm israeli, and 16 yo, I got the vaccine two days ago, I'm feeling great.
1/1	I'm jealous at how the vaccine rollout in the US has been. In India we're still at 53m doses for a 1.3 billion population with the main focus of political parties being some state elections.
0/0	I'm just astounded that people are still spouting (and believing) the vax propaganda. The vaccine is NOT very effective and does NOT stop the spread of covid, and especially not Omicron. FACT.
0/0	I'm just glad I never got caught up in politics enough to ever get suckered into taking the vaccine
1/1	I'm just gonna get it and not talk about it. I'm not sure why we have to constantly talk about it.
0/0	I'm just gonna say what the baby killers say.... My body, my choice!!!!
1/-1	I'm just here to learn from all the internet WebMD experts
0/0/0	I'm just here to watch my enemies poison themselves. Carry on.
0/0/0/0/-1	I'm just not sure I'll feel comfortable getting the first wave of a vaccine developed this quickly.
1/1	I'm just saying, if it was a 1 in 100 chance of dying from covid or a 1 in a million chance of getting a side effect from the vaccine, the math would strongly support taking the vaccine
1/1	I'm just so glad that back in the 1950s my mother and 99.9% of her peers followed medical advice and vaccinated us kids rather than thinking they knew better. I could have been dead from smallpox by now if my mother had only had a "friend" who knew so much more than her doctor.
0/0	I'm just waiting for this to turn into a Zombie apocalypse.
1/1	I'm just waiting, waiting for that anti-coronavirus vaccine movement to come about in reaction to it finally becoming available for average people.
1	I'm just worried about the additives, other than that, the vaccine seems very clever and sound.
0/0	I'm just worried about the long term effects
1/0/1/1/1	I'm legit allergic to vaccines. So thanks to the rest of yall for keeping us out of the cross fire.
0/0	I'm living FREE right now with no vaccine.
1/1	I'm looking forward to finding out how the Moderna vaccine does. It was the only vaccine in my area. My husband who is a healthcare worker got the Phizer vaccine at work so that makes me feel better for him. I assume Moderna will be similar as they are both mRNA
1/1	I'm looking forward to getting my Covid vaccine next week. I'll happily wear a mask and social distance until we reach herd immunity.
1/1	I'm looking forward to getting my vaccination as soon as possible.
1/1	I'm looking forward to getting the COVID-19 vaccine too I have asthma, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure. I have a flu shot ever year I'm also in my mid 60's
1/1	I'm looking forward to getting the mRNA vaccine!
1/1	I'm looking forward to getting vaccinated in hopefully a few months time. The more antivaxers that refuse to take it, the faster the roll out to everyone else.
0/0	I'm low risk, physically and mentally fit. Someone else can have my doses.
0/0	I'm low risk. physically and mentally fit. Someone else can have my doses.
1	I'm lucky enough to have Pfizer Vaccination !
0/0	I'm more afraid of the vaccine than the covid itself.
0/0	I'm more immune now that I've had covid than I was with the vaccine.
0/0	I'm more likely to die in a car accident than die of COVID. And I still drive every day..
1/1	I'm more scared of covid than of any potential vaccine side effects!
1/1	I'm more than excited to get vaccinated!
0/0	I'm more than willing to wear the mask. year round, but not your VACCINE! I'M A OKAY!
0/0	I'm naturally immunized by having Coronavirus and I don't need additional vaccine that will probably make me sick. That simple. If you are immunized by vaccine you don't need to worry about me the same way I'm not worried about anyone else. My body My choice. üòÑ
0/0	I'm never getting any sort of new vaccine until companies are held liable for when they kill or damage people. The fact they're protected should be enough to tell you something isn't right.
0/0	I'm never getting this vaccine.
0/0	I'm never getting vaccinated Dont trust the government look how there running this country it's a joke and they call them self leaders.
0/0	I'm never going to take it personally I think there's no point in taking it because the risks are too high and I don't want to live on taking a new one every 6 months
0/0	I'm never taking the vaccine
0/0	I'm never taking the vaccine. Your body, your choice people.
0/0	I'm no anti-vaxer, but it's probably safer to take the vaccine after a while, let others go first and see if the vaccine is safe or not. The vaccine seems to be quite rushed, I'll be waiting until its proven safe.
0/0	I'm no longer an organ donor. If my body isn't good enough to receive a transplant because I decided not to get the vaccine, it isn't good enough to donate either ü§∑‚ôÄÔ∏è
0/0	I'm no one's lab rat..
0/0	I'm normal now.. I won't be having any expermenat DNA altering jab.
0/0/0/0	I'm not "one of those" types but these "see it's safe!" videos are so unbearable... We literally have zero idea what they're actually being injected with.
0/0	I'm not Anti-Vax but I do not trust this vaccine and would prefer to wait a few before taking it. I don't trust this vaccine at all.
1/1	I'm not Anti-Vax, vaccines do a lot of long-term good things for you.
0/-1	I'm not a anti vaxxer or anything but how quickly they came out with it is worrisome. I have multiple anxiety disorders that make me more scared than the average person but I think I have a right to be scared everyone has a right to be scared. It's the unknown that frightens me. I'm scared of covid and I'm scared of the shot. Us anxiety folks are royally screwed
0/0	I'm not a fan of vaccines in general, don't get the flu shot and don't plan on receiving any COVID-19 vaccine. Especially after viewing the video interview with Jorge Araujo, former Merck chemist
0/0	I'm not a lab rat.. I will wait till the current rats have thinned out or not. So far plenty are dropping down.
0	I'm not a lab rat.. I will wait till the current rats have thinned out or not. So far plenty are dropping down. (y) great stuff. If 1 death out of 10.000 infected is enough to stop the world, wouldn't 1 death out of 10.000 vaccinated be enough to stop the program? Guess not..
1/1	I'm not a risk patient for the flu, but I still get my flu shot because having the flu, even if I have a fairly good immunity, sucks cock and I hate it.
1/1	I'm not afraid at all since I'm vaccinated. I'm being cautious because I don't want to be an asymptomatic spreader. I think it's great that people are being considerate.
1/-1	I'm not afraid of COVID. I am more worried about going crazy and losing my from being in quarantine and not able to go anywhere!
0/0	I'm not against the vaccine for those who believe in them.. but for me it's a big No.
0/0	I'm not against vaccine buuuut usualy we have to wait 12 years to be sure of a vaccin... annnnd it's quite short
1/1	I'm not against vaccine.
0/0	I'm not against vaccines, but the mRNA vaccines have only had very limited testing, and if excess respiratory deaths are within normal for the year, there simply is no health emergency to justify mass vaccination with an experimental drug.
0/0	I'm not against vacine but I'm not getting the vacine at this time.
0/-1	I'm not an "anti-vaxxer" but I'm skeptical about a newly released, expedited, corporate driven, never been before proven methodology vaccine, for a disease we know very little about.
0/0	I'm not an "anti-vaxxer." I've had many vaccines. Just not this one. Not yet. Too new, too rushed.
0/-1	I'm not an anti vaxxer (my husband, child and I have had all our vaccines) but I feel this vaccine has been rushed out and I don't trust it.
0/0	I'm not an anti vaxxer, but I do have reservations about being injected with something that's been quite rushed.
1/0	I'm not an anti-vaccer, but this would be the thin end of a VERY suspicious wedge. If only because there's a big difference between being anti-vaccine in general and being suspicious of a new vaccine like this one. Even in a pandemic, people are entitled to their opinions in any country that claims to be free and democratic. If this move is successful, then I do NOT believe any promises that the vaccine won't become compulsory. The thing is - there is a partial answer to the problem. In my experience, any inaccurate information coming from opinionated individuals is dwarfed by the rubbish being put out by bots and trolls which to date are hardly controlled at all - and that covers all sorts of areas, not just covid. Do something about the trolls and imho 90% of the disinformation will vanish. But banning opinion? Just plain dangerous.
0/0	I'm not an anti-vax person. I'm also not an anti-common sense person! I'm concerned about the way that these vaccines were rushed to market in less than a year. The vaccine approval process usually takes 5-15 years! I'll wait & see.
0/-1	I'm not an anti-vaxxer but I am nervous about this current covid-19 vaccine can someone please tell me more facts about it
0/0	I'm not an anti-vaxxer but a vaccine developed in 6-12 months is giving me doubts.
0/0	I'm not an anti-vaxxer but a vaccine developed in 6-12months is giving me doubts
0/0	I'm not anti vax I'm anti this vax and the way its being forcibly implemented.
1/0	I'm not anti vax and have all the regular vaccines we get in my country as kids but I'm not allowed to take the jab for my doctor.
0/0	I'm not anti vax, I'm just waiting for the 3 year human trial period to be complete before making an assessment. With 2 of the 3 vaccines now "on pause" or outright banned because of complications, and none of them seeming to slow the spread, I think I'm making the right choice.
1/-1	I'm not anti vax, as people love to say, I'm pro choice, for every medical choice there is. It's up to you, just make educated choices. I honestly don't know how people are even arguing otherwise.
1/-1	I'm not anti vax, but I'd like to wait just a bit to see more data on which vaccine is best and maybe see more availability of types of vaccines. I'm in no rush, in this rural area.
0/0/0	I'm not anti vax. I get the flue vaccine every year, but I just don't trust two things about the new COVID Vaccines. 1. I don't have trust in the long term safety of the new mRna vaccines. 2. The speed they were developed doesn't inspire confidence in their safety. I will probably wait until the Novavax or the GSK vaccines are approved since they use traditional methodology in their production.
0/0	I'm not anti-vac but I'm not taking a vaccine with 99.7% survival rate while also the fact I probably already had the virus
0/0	I'm not anti-vaccine, I'm anti-this vaccine.
0/0	I'm not anti-vaccine, just anti THIS vaccine that has been rushed and not tested properly
0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I'm not anti-vaccine, just anti THIS vaccine that has been rushed and not tested properly. For all we know it might be a polio 2.0
0	I'm not anti-vax or anything, but I had COVID and those side effects sound worse than the virus itself, as most people have mild symptoms like I did
0	I'm not anti-vax, I'm anti-ruining my health for sure just because of a chance of getting something else ruining my health. And I've had the flu. It was bad. But that is the chance I have to take so I'm not crippled with disabling arthritis and severe plaque psoriasis all over my body instead of just my scalp
0/0	I'm not anti-vax, I'm just anti-covid vax.
0/1	I'm not antivax but I'm concerned about ingredients as I am in everything I put in my body. Because in the past they say oh this ingredient is safe and then years later, oh this product causes cancer and if you or a loved one have been hurt by one you may be compensated.
0/0	I'm not at risk so what is my benefit exactly? 99.9% chance of survival for the unvaccinated. Vaccinated people's not looking too good.
1/1	I'm not confused. We are in a race to vaccinate before variants dim the effectiveness. We are also in a race to get people to continue mitigation efforts as more than 25 states are showing an increase in infections. If we want a return to some normalcy this summer we must hold the line.
0/0	I'm not for the covid vaccine because the evidence doesn't add up to that being necessary in order to survive.
0/0	I'm not getting a vaccine cuz my body my choice

0/0	I'm not getting it. It's just another type of flu shot, I need more study on it. Also what if it has a tracking cell.

0/0	I'm not getting the vaccine because it's dangerous. There have been many major side effects including two deaths from heart attacks. The heart attacks were two hour after the vaccine was given
0/0	I'm not getting the vaccine unless it comes with $10 million in cash up front.
0/0	I'm not getting the vaccine. If I get it, I get it. I work at a hospital and the only people I've ever seen hospitalized with it are the morbidly obese or people with lung cancer or some shit like that. I've had a ton of people I know get it and they were all fine. I've also been hanging out with people the whole way through this pandemic. The only part that actually changed my life is that I didn't go to bars, and found that if I did my drinking at home with people I actually liked then I saved a ton of money. So I say go back to normal and let me see some live music again and if I catch it and die then that's on me.

0/0	I'm not hesitant!.......I'm very sure I won't take this new vaccine.
1/1	I'm not hesitating - I just can't get it. I'm in FL and getting a vaccination here is harder than hitting the Lotto. Trying to sign up on line is a nightmare and there is no solution in sight.
0/0	I'm not in a fork in the road, I will not trust this vaccine.. its GAMBAL to get the vax.
1/1	I'm not in a hurry to take it, but I'll take it.
0/0	I'm not interested in how you feel now, I'm interested in how you are after 2-10 years with the vaccine in your body
0/0	I'm not keen on having the live virus injected into this marvelous work of creation
0/0	I'm not planning to get the vaccine, I rather aquire immunity through infection. I think eventually we all will be getting it at some point.
0/0	I'm not pumping no more shit into my body unless it's steroids
0/0	I'm not putting a disease in my body period! people do your research on all of side effects and look hard! make your choice.
0/0	I'm not putting a experimental vaccine in me
0/0	I'm not putting these vaccines in my body. You don't know what dangerous chemicals are in it.
0/0	I'm not responsible for your health either. If you're worried, wear a mask, social distance or just stay home.
0/0	I'm not scared of vaccines..had many but NOT this one with new mRNA tech, not fully tested..no long term studies..not tested on pregnant woman..no assessment of fertility ..lots of adverse reactions NOT JUST A SORE ARM. 1143 DEATHS, 800,000 + adverse reactions ranging from blood clots, heart attacks, blindness, abortions, bells palsy, Guillaume barre syndrome..and many more..
0/0	I'm not sure about getting old if this is how the world treats old people
1/1	I'm not sure it's possible to change the minds of those who are extremely skeptical of the vaccine at this point. Perhaps Mississippi should focus on getting a high ratio of younger, potentially more open-minded people to get the vaccine, instead of spending time trying to convince older individuals that the vaccine's benefits outweigh the risks. This strategy will indirectly benefit those skeptical older individuals by significantly slowing the spread of the virus in both young and old people. This rationale made me rush to get the vaccine as soon as I could: While I can't convince some of my older relatives to get the vaccine, I can at least make sure I'm vaccinated and therefore they won't get COVID from me
0/0/0	I'm not takin no vaccine shot especially from a mf I buy lotion from
0/0	I'm not taking a vaccine that's still in the testing phase. I've had covid and symptoms were mild. I now have covid anti bodies. I'm generally fit, healthy and youngish. I am proof many don't need the covid vaccine. I will not allow pharma to get rich off my health.
0/0	I'm not taking any emergency released vaccinations!!!!
0/0	I'm not taking any vaccine!
0/0	I'm not taking any vaccine, something in that vaccine that will turn us people to brainless-zombies servicing the government against our will.

0	I'm not taking it because i don't need it
0/0/0	I'm not taking it either...nor are anyone I know and love. And no amount of shaming or explanations will change that. And for the record ...all i know have Masters degrees. Again its based on individual choice.
0/0	I'm not taking it if it's mandatory,
0/0	I'm not taking it!
0/0	I'm not taking it.
0/0	I'm not taking it. I'm not taking it. I'm not taking it. The d/r of Covid-19 is 1/4 of the flu. It is a common cold. That's all. Real d/r is only 0.037%. It's the biggest HOAX in world history, and 90% of Americans have fallen for it.
0/0	I'm not taking it. It's not what they say it is. Even they say it's required for exchanging goods, and even threatened to arrest even executions, not taking it!
0/0	I'm not taking it. Vaccines are just Big Bucks for Big Pharma and doctors.
0/0/0/0	I'm not taking it. Why because operation warp speed is entirely too fast. I am not willing to put me or my children through it knowing that my children and i have allergies.
0/0	I'm not taking no dam vaccine

0/0	I'm not taking this Shot !!!!
0/0	I'm not taking this vaccine and no way they can force me.
1/1/1/1	I'm not throwing away my shot!! Got vaccinated and perfectly alright today
0/0	I'm not too sure anymore if I will get the vaccine. I don't want to be the one who will give them the datas..
1/1	I'm not too worried about side effects. Even if some number of random people are dropping dead from the vaccine, odds are low anything will happen to me.
0/0	I'm not trying to get pregnant, but I can say that my cycle has been completely messed up since getting the vaccine. I'm constantly on my period. I have been diagnosed with PCOS BEFORE getting the vaccine so I do think that is why my body has responded this way but i do think if I decided to try for a baby my fertility would be affected.
0/0/0/0	I'm not willing to have those side effects!
0/0	I'm not willing to take something that has not been tested for side effects in people with cancer HIV and pneumonia COPD or other health issues for that matter, this is a vaccine that is rushed and I do not trust it how do we get a pandemic and a vaccine is made quickly mean while we have children and others dying of cancer 4 more then a hundred years and still can't find a vaccine or a cure kind of makes me sick
0/0	I'm not worried about being chipped. I'm worried about taking a brand new fucking vaccine
0/0	I'm not worried as well as many many others! And I won't be getting poisoned either, NO MATTER how much fear mongering you, together with the rest of the CRIMINAL media dishes out!
0/0	I'm nothing like an anti-vaxxer! I just think that all the experts are wrong, this "treatment" is a danger to children and must be banned, all the experts are probably in on a big conspiracy, they've not tested it for long enough anyway, have you read this blog?
1/1	I'm ok with this, the more jabs the more the stock prices rise. Keep them going. :)
1	I'm old, and have been through a few things like the polio epidemic/pandemic and other flu epidemics and scares. I considered the speed that this vaccine came to emergency approval, a miracle. The notion that the system was being worked on for years, gave me hope, so I signed up as soon as I qualified. I guess I thought everyone would look at it as the same as any other required vaccine. I think the same people who object to the vaccine, would be the same people complaining if we couldn't get one early and fast. Depends on who you listen to.
1/1	I'm on dose 1 of 2 for the astra zeneca and would definitely do it again in a heart beat. Little bit of soreness (my butt literally hurt the next day). But other than that it is a nice feeling to be walking around with a little protection on board. Won't change my behavior in terms of PPE of course, but it's nice to have a slight change of mindset. Would recommend.
1/-1	I'm on the ledge with trusting it. They should show that it's safe.
1	I'm one of the lucky few. Next week will be my 2nd week after my 2nd dose! Sad part is where I live, hardly anyone is getting vaccinated. Hardcore trumpland.
1/1	I'm one of the ones in the top priority to get the vaccine when it's available
0/0	I'm one that Will not get it I will take my chances God in in my heart he will be with me all the way through
0/1	I'm one.\nGot the mumps vaccine when it was introduced had the mumps 6 months later
1/1	I'm part of one of the trial groups. Heading to the right direction for everyone! It'll be a few months but there is a light at the end of the tunnel.
1/1	I'm partially vaccinated, getting my 2nd one in a few weeks. It was really cool to experience the vaccine clinic, definitely felt Iike history in the making.
0/0/0	I'm perfectly healthy. But i'm forced to get the vaccine. Now I am infected! Are we living in an idiot world?
1/1	I'm personally glad there are people who don't want the vaccine. That increases the chances for those of us who want it to get it.
1/1	I'm planning getting the shot still and will keep wearing my mask till this covid-19 is over
1/1/1	I'm planning getting vaccinated for Covid, but can you take benadryl aftermath?
1/1	I'm pleased to note how many people are NOW saying they'll have the vaccine when its offered
1/1	I'm portuguese and almost everyone I know wants to be vaccinated, that is correct, but many of them are now afraid to get Astrazeneca's vaccine specifically to the point some say they will refuse it or want another vaccine because of the controversy.
1/1	I'm pretty good at examining potential consequences, and really the only thing outside of normal immune reaction side effects I can think is an excessive inflammatory reaction related to the delivery mechanism.
0/0	I'm pretty relaxed about this; as an under-50 year old in the private sector with with no underlying health conditions, by the time the NHS gets round to even offering me a vaccine, there will be over a year (probably longer) of real world testing on healthcare workers, the elderly and infirm. If there are unwanted side effects I'll know all about them long before I have to make a choice about getting the vaccine.
1/1	I'm pretty sure I would be hospitalized right now if I hadn't had my three shots. My o2 got as low as 77% in the middle of the night when I was barely wakeful, had childhood asthma and just in the last year stopped taking/needing hypertension meds. Day 15 with COVID instead of
0/0	I'm pretty sure vaccine isn't the correct term, its actually gene therapy
0/0	I'm pretty sure vaccine isn't the correct term, its actually gene therapy.
1/1	I'm pro vaccine and every covid safe measure. But this is a unique virus and set of circumstances Australia finds itself in. I just hope we don't inadvertently makes things worse here, because compared to the rest of the world, we are doing very well
1/1	I'm pro vaccine because Covid is high risk for some ( likely much higher than vaccine) but I don't pretend to know something that can't possibly be proven at this point
1/1	I'm pro vaccine but I would never "punish" someone for decisions others make about their own bodies.
1/1	I'm pro vaccine but I wouldn't force it on people, it should remain an individual choice.
1/0	I'm pro vaccine but I'm not interested in a vaccine for SARS-cov-2 if it comes out next year. I'd rather it be out for a year or so in the general public before taking it myself. I just want more testing behind it.
1/1	I'm pro vaccine, I hope as many people as possible get vaccinated, but it's a particularly British thing that the more we're told we must do something the more resistance we put up.
0/0	I'm pro vaccine, but not when it comes to experimental vaccines like these.
1/1	I'm pro vaccines, and I will most likely get an eventual Covid vaccine eventually. That said it's naive to think that it will be 100% safe. The swineflu vaccine which was also rushed, caused an outbreak of narcolepsy and some other things were rumored but not proven as far as I recall
1/1	I'm pro vax, I have had a flu jab every year. As part of duty of care in my job, I don't mind. My choice. I'm also pro choice, if you don't want it. No way should you have it. But don't call me stupid, if I don't agree with your choice.. Its my choice..
1/1	I'm probably not in the risk group (hashimoto's) but I will get it as soon as it's made available to me.
1/1	I'm proud to be vaccinated. I did it to protect others & myself.
1/1	I'm proud to have been given your product, actually all my family have and we feel healthier than ever. Thanks BioNTech!
0/0	I'm quite sure it wasn't ever meant to stop transmission and all these people are just fucking liars.
0/1	I'm quitting my job if they require me to take it.
1/1/1/1	I'm ready for my turn.
1/1	I'm ready for the pandemic to be over.
1/1	I'm ready to be injected now!
0/0	I'm ready to quit the moment my employer says I have to take a vaccine
0/0	I'm ready to quit the moment my employer says I have to take a vaccine.
0/0/0/0	I'm ready to quit the moment my employer says I have to take a vaccine. This goes way way deeper than most people would ever think possible.
1/-1	I'm ready to see all the anti vaxers come out in force now
1/1	I'm ready...... let's get this party started
1/1/1/1/1/1/1	I'm really glad that you had the opportunity to get your shots!!
1/1	I'm really proud of how stuff like this gets explained my Mike and other experts, talking about international effort, more details about the mRNA vaccines really shined some light to me what we really accomplished and what we still can accomplish as a society if we just dedicate ourselves to it! Much love to anyone who reads this and stay strong we'll get through this!
1/1	I'm really sick of all the vaccine skepticism that even happens in my own home. First of all, it's not just take for yourself but for everyone else too, but also l, bro if the 1% had already been so out to get the vaccine, you can bet that it's generally quite safe and ifs not gonna turn you into an alien fish or whatever.
1/0	I'm recovering from covid I'm going to get vaccinated asap cuz that shit fuckin hurt
0/0	I'm refusing the vax.
0/0	I'm running a vaccine trial with myself as the guinea-pig .... Good food, vitamin D, sleep and social distancing. So far it's 100% effective.
0/0	I'm scared and wont take the vaccine, too many downsides with it and people still get the flu even after their 3 shots
0/0	I'm scared from the possible long term side effects
0/0	I'm scared of the sideeffects
1/1/1/1/1/1	I'm scheduled to be vaccinated on thursday. I work in a covid unit and see the devastation of this virus, so I'm really excited it's finally here. I've been keeping up with the science because, like anyone, I don't want to roll up my sleeve to something that isn't safe. I feel confident in this vaccine. mRNA vaccines have been studied for over a decade. The reason this one was developed quickly is because the whole world was throwing money at this project. It's amazing what can be accomplished with such a huge collective effort. Roll up those sleeves, America. Let's save a life and get back to something more normal.
1/1	I'm scheduled to get 1st dose this week. Pfizer vaccine.
1/1	I'm scheduled to get my first shot this Friday! Yay!!
0/1	I'm scheduled to get the vaccine. What are so many people afraid of? There's going to be an occasional allergic response. No one has died from it. Don't complain about wearing masks, businesses being shut down, unemployment if your not willing to be part of the solution.
0/0	I'm seeing un poked healthy people recover from Rona in 48 hours . Do not get poked unless your elderly or have health conditions, you don't need it ....kids definitely not it's outrageous . Thrombosis is not rare neither is heart inflammation ...it is rife, I know many personally .
0/0	I'm seeing un poked healthy people recover from Rona in 48 hours. Do not get poked unless your elderly or have health conditions, you don't need it.... kids definitely not it's outrageous.
0/0	I'm seriously asking. not attempting to be an a$$hole. But why did you get it in the first place? Again. this question is sincere. Thanks
1/1	I'm shocked of the people in this world, there is so many who belive in lies. This is a normal vaccine as all the others out there are
0/-1	I'm sick and tired of being responsible for someone else's fears.
1/0	I'm sick and tired of being responsible for someone else's fears. I'm not responsible for your health either. If you're worried, wear a mask, social distance or just stay home. Stop pretending you have the right to make me do it for you
0/0	I'm sick of the deaths and sickness from vaccines. Wake up before it's too late.
1/1	I'm signed up for my first vaccine dose on Monday (I work at the hospital) and I was a little nervous. I feel a lot more prepared now!
0/0	I'm skeptical about the vaccine. Not so much the medicine....but the idea I've heard about putting a chip in it. No way!!
1/1	I'm so envious that you have the COVID Vaccine! Here in Australia we haven't gained access to it yet, here's hoping it is soon
1/1	I'm so envious that you have the COVID Vaccine! Here in Australia we haven't gained access to it yet, here's hoping it is soon! I hope you stay healthy and well, happy new year!
1/1	I'm so excited about the vaccine! I wish we could get it right now.
1	I'm so excited about the vaccine! I wish we could get it right now. This is fantastic news! Merry Christmas everyone!
1/1	I'm so excited to get my second COVID shot in 5 days
1/1	I'm so getting a happy ending with mine.
1/1	I'm so glad I made the right decision in getting these jabs
1/1	I'm so glad my mom wasn't huge on the internet when I was a baby, she told me the other day "if I knew what I know now, I wouldn't have vaccinated you" and I just stared at her for a couple seconds
1/1/1/1	I'm so glad you all could get vaccinated and that it's providing such good protection vs. COVID.
1/1	I'm so glad! As a mom I've been waiting for this! I want my kids to be safe!
1/1/1/1/1	I'm so grateful for vaccines. And so glad that new techniques are making them more effective and faster to make!
1	I'm so happy - my mother-in-law in LTC received her first vaccine shot yesterday. You have no idea what a relief it is, we've been petrified for almost a year. Every phone call would send the heart racing.
0/0	I'm so happy I didn't get the vaccine
0/0	I'm so happy that my grandparents don't wanna take it. BIG NO.!
1/0	I'm so happy to know all the many conspiracy theories about the vaccine. Yay!
1/1	I'm so happy, I love seeing people say yes to science
1/1	I'm so proud to be a part of this trial! üí™üèº How wonderful to hopefully have another vaccine rolling out soon!
0/0	I'm so scared. My dad was just brought to the hospital after having the 2nd shot. He couldn't breath and he was very confused. Im so scared he is going to die.
0/0	I'm so sketchy on this vaccine.. My moms uncle apparently got vaccinated and was found dead a couple days later from a "fall". He was perfectly healthy and had zero troubles walking. Idk man
0/0/0/0	I'm so sorry for the families shattered by vaccine injuries. Thank you to these families who share their heartbreaks. You are saving so many lives!!!! Please people wake up.
1/1	I'm so sorry for your loss. I lost all sympathy for these selfish idiots who refuse to get vaccinated.
1/1	I'm so thankful my daughter in law. Vaccinats my grandchildren!
1/1	I'm so tired of the anti-vaxxers out in full force, protesting in the streets!
1/1	I'm so very glad I'm vaccinated, I want to take part in community events and go to concerts and other things. Anti-vaxxxers are really quite disgusting people, I understand they have their concerns and they have their feelings and opinions, but attacking those of us who are vaccinated is wrong, totally wrong.
1/1	I'm sold. Where do I get this Johnson & Johnson vaccine? Can't find it anywhere.
0/0	I'm someone who NEVER gets allergies now after taking both doses I have ALLERGIES! Dont do my mistake! Avoid the shot!
1/1	I'm soooo looking forward to my vaccination in a few months!
0/0	I'm soooooooo glad me and my family were smart enough not to get jabbed
1/1	I'm sorry John, I tried! I tried trying to explain all these points to vaccine skeptics but I just can't anymore! I can't try and convince stupid people why they need to help themselves and other people!
0/0	I'm sorry POTUS fell for this, it looks like pure welfare for big pharma. There is NO way they could suddenly come up with a Corona virus vaccine in months when they've tried unsuccessfully for decades. I think it's a scam.
0/0	I'm sorry but a vaccine that was developed in such a short time cannot possibly have no side effects.
1/1	I'm sorry for your loss but just because it happened after getting vaccinated doesn't mean it's the vaccine
1/0	I'm sorry for your loss, but you have no reason to apologize for feeling that way. I've said this when the Vaccine was first issued. I'll defend your right to not get Vaccinated, if you defend my right to a Hospital bed if needed.
0/0	I'm sorry he can let us know in a few years time . No way am I having it done . How many times have they come out with a vaccine, for it to have enormous side effects.
1/-1	I'm sorry to be critical but I don't think the J&J vaccine is a good idea in places where the mRNA vaccines are an option. Preventing serious illness is all well and good for the vaccinated person, but if you're still able to become infected and transmit the virus, then everyone else around you continues to be borked. Better to have the vaccine that appears to prevent infection and transmission than the one that saves just the transmitter from serious symptoms.
1/1	I'm sorry what? I've done the research on the vaccine, and how it works. I know EXACTLY how it works, from knowing the sequence of the amino acids to have it produces the spike proteins (sorry for all the complicated words, your 1st grade vocabulary and knowledge must be having trouble understanding). I have concluded that there is no way that the vaccine is harmful IN ANY way.
1/1	I'm sorry! I got my second shot yesterday too, and am super achy, but other than that I'm good. So far. Glad to be protected, but side effects aren't fun.
1/1	I'm sorry, I just can't understand HOW a woman can be training to be a nurse and be against vaccines at the same time.
1/1	I'm spiritual but I also believe in science and facts. I also have asthma so I am very vulnerable to covid. So I'm getting the Johnson and Johnson tomorrow.
0/0	I'm starting to think I should've held out a little longer before getting fully vaxxed.
0/0	I'm staying away from people who are vaccinated. Something in my spirit tells me somethings not right. I'm gonna trust my intuition once again.
1/1	I'm still alive and haven't became a 5g transmitter beacon so I guess that's a good thing...
0/0	I'm still not getting any shots, thanx anyways
0/0	I'm still not getting it.
0/0	I'm still not getting the shot.
0/0	I'm still not going to take no shot, what Joe don't understang, God got me.
0/0	I'm still not taking it and I don't care what clergy member does it's not going to change my mind.
0/1	I'm still not taking that vaccine don't trust it
0/1	I'm still very happy with my decision to get vaccinated, and I was lucky to get it back in January through my job. I can see why people would be hesitant but just do your research and do what's best for you.
1/1	I'm strongly in favor of vaccination, and I think it's dangerous not to at least try
1/1	I'm struggling to get through this. These anti-vaxxers make no sense and it makes my skin crawlllll.
0/0	I'm such a Humanitarian that someone else can have my dose of death.
1/1	I'm super curious to see how people respond to it, especially folks who have autoimmune conditions but aren't immunocompromised. (Context: I fall in that camp myself and have pretty stressful reactions to vaccines usually so I tend to only get certain ones. For folks like me, it'll be helpful to see how it seems to go for other atypical folks.)
0/0	I'm super sure I'm not getting another shot.
0/0	I'm supposed to get the vaccine because he got a side effect?
0/0	I'm sure somebody has probably already posted a comment like this BUT.....if these vaccinations work so well, wtf are the people that have said vaccines worrying about the anti-vax crowd for?
0/0	I'm sure that Putin will offer the vaccine to all of his political opponents free of charge.
1/1	I'm sure that will be the only one my insurance will cover...
0/0	I'm sure there will be a many more vaccine horror stories.
0/0/0/0	I'm sure this has made anyone who doesn't want to get the vaccine, now beating down the doors to be 1st in line. made me not want it even more
1/1	I'm sure to each of the anti vaccination idiots commenting here, their body is a temple. They don't smoke, don't drink, don't eat any unhealthy food and have never had any other medication or vaccines.
0/-1	I'm surprised YouTube allowed this video, oh its bs no wonder
0/0	I'm surprised they want everyone protected but not out of poverty, if you are such a kind heart share your wealth with us first then we will have fate in your vaccine that you so generously want to share; we don't trust this thing you want every one to have so badly
1/1	I'm sympathetic to the people who are skeptical, especially considering that this country doesn't have the best track record when it comes to minorities and medicine, but to ignore how dangerous the virus is and say that the vaccine is unnecessary because "my mom didn't die" is ridiculous.
0/0	I'm taking God's medicine because his word is health to all our flesh ..... all our flesh !
1/1	I'm taking it
1/1	I'm taking mine tomorrow! Pumped!!!
1/1	I'm taking my responsibility and getting my shots.
1/1	I'm taking my vaccine today and I couldn't be happier.
1/1	I'm taking this covid shit serious I wear a mask everywhere I go even though I got both my covid shots and my booster not taking NO CHANCES
1/1	I'm tearing up that this is finally coming. It's been such a tough last 9 months here in the rural midwest where the majority of people don't take things seriously and then people die. Hopefully this is a sign that we're almost at the end.
0/0	I'm thankful my kids are older. This has gotten crazy vacinating kids
0/0	I'm the only one at my job too. All vaxxed. Even the ones who were afraid caved in from the pressure. Only me chose to quit. Felt like an alien. Where are our like in real life?
0/0	I'm too allergic to medications and vaccines. I'm not afraid of getting Covid and won't be getting it. My surgeon who was doing my foot surgery had his second dose and had to be hospitalized. Nope
0/0	I'm trying to get medical treatment in the Philadelphia area and they refuse to treat me until I take the vaccine I told them forget it then
1/1	I'm unaware of any anti vaxxers I know IRL, I am however aware of people who do not want to get the covid vaccine, though I think they have been coming around on it lately.
0/0	I'm unvaccinated I'll sit any room with anyone who has any disease my Father in Heaven is stronger than any disease on this planet bring it
0/0	I'm unvaccinated, tested over 3 days each week since September and never got a positive result or felt symptoms. And I've been exposed to lots of vaccinated people who got covid and got sick.
0/0	I'm unvaccinated. I'm not anti-vax. I just believe in choice.
0/0	I'm unvaxed...had the Kung Flu......Shook it off in a couple of days.....no biggie. Chance I decided and was prepared to take. So, as such, I will continue to maintain unvaxed status.
1	I'm vaccinated and boosted and so is my family. Thank you Mr. President for helping everyone have access.
1/1	I'm vaccinated and boosted, everyone should do the same
1/1	I'm vaccinated and encourage others to do the same, but I support the nurse. Nobody should lose their job because they refuse a vaccine. We have bodily autonomy, and it's nobody's business but our own about what gets injected to it.
0/0	I'm vaccinated and got the booster plus I had covid!! I refuse to get anymore!!
0/0	I'm vaccinated and wish I wasnt. Don't need one, didn't want one. But bought into the promise that we could end this nonsense if I got one.
1/1	I'm vaccinated.
1/1	I'm vaccinated. I have the Pfizer vaccines. I personally didn't experience anything other than my arm being sore with both vaccines.
1/1	I'm vaccinated. period.
1/1	I'm vax'd and boosted - and home sick with Covid. Symptoms are MILD and I am so grateful that the vaccines worked as promised. As a nurse ( over 40 yrs), I followed the science. So thankful for my training.
1/1	I'm vaxxed and past the two weeks since my last shot. I'ma eat out now.
1/1	I'm very pro-vaccine and fully align with your risk-benefit analysis.
1/1/1/1	I'm very pro-vaccines and I think this vaccine should be used
1/1/1	I'm very pro-vaccines and I think this vaccine should be used, but I don't get this argument.
0/-1	I'm very skeptical in taking this vaccine my choice my decision.
1/1	I'm waiting my turn with optimism.
1/-1	I'm waiting until I can get the Pfizer vaccine and when I can get the second dose within the effectiveness window.
0/0	I'm well and truly in the 1b catergory with underlying conditions but after a great deal of thought, I have no faith in the #AstraZenaca vaccine. With an appt to get the jab I am strongly veering away from proceeding. Should I go ahead or take my chances? Whaddaya reckon?
0/0	I'm willing to donate my dose since I won't be using it.
0/0	I'm with the anti Vax
0/0	I'm with you!! I'm not getting it either.
0/0	I'm with you. Somebody else can have mine.
0/0	I'm woke, I refuse the vaccine.
1/1	I'm wondering when people start intentionally infecting themselves with covid and rather take this risk instead of taking the totally awesome, totally safe and totally effective heavenly vaccine.
0/0	I'm working on fighting the vaccines
1	I'm working on the shot!
1/1	I'm working so many hours because half of my coworkers ended up with covid (get the vaccine ya'll pls) and so I have to manage a store by myself for, well... it's been 3 weeks now... I'm pretty exhaysesd and tired, working 11 hours a day..
0/0	I'm writing today also, but with this: Covid 19 vaccines are, by their own description, experimental. They are intended for the whole planet. Experiments go right, experiments go wrong. If this goes wrong, it wipes out the human race. How can any reasonable person support that?
1/1	I'm young and just got my second shot last friday. Within the day my arm got a little sore (curiously not as sore as the first). On Saturday I developed a fever that peaked at 101.4, and then broke before dinner. Overall I got mild sickness for about 7 hours and then felt normal again and was running/doing cardio by the next day. So don't fear the shot, because even if you do get a fever, it may not even last more than a few hours.
0/0	I'm young, healthy, don't ever get sick and have never had a flu or any kind of virus other than the odd stomach bug.
1/1/1	I'ma take it
0/0	I've 3 doses and got omicron so it's useless
1/1	I've already booked my kid's first shot for this Saturday!
1/-1	I've already had it months ago...So, I think I will sit this argument out.,
0/0/1	I've already taken my shots but people apparently are still getting covid in spite of their shots the cases on the rise concerning this in Florida.
0/-1	I've also heard of people having a hard time breathing after getting the shot
1/1/1/1	I've been fully vaccinated for over a month. Felt a little tired after the shots, but other than that, no problems.
0/0	I've been hearing about too many people dying just days after taking the vaccine. Plus they came out with it way too quick.
0/0	I've been ill for 8 months following my second Pfizer I'm suffering long vaccine.
1/1	I've been looking in the internet and I'm willing to take it as long as it isn't anything bad like the mark of the beast, and/or mixes my dna. Not sure but if one of those is true I'm really scared.
0/0	I've been mask free this whole time. I've even processed thousands of recycled can's and bottles from a hotel chain. No mask. No probs. This whole thing is phaaake!
1/1	I've been saying this for months. There's likely a bias in all these polls that leads to anti-vaxxers being more likely to respond to them.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I've been surrounded by people with Covid & I have not yet got it. Meaning I'm immune... Why the hell would I want this type of vaccine.
0/0	I've been told, I shoulda been vaccinated I could've been vaccinated I would've been vaccinated and with all the shoulda Coulda Woulda's The answer is still NO. Let me decide when I want to get vaccinated and if I never do... So what
1/1	I've been triple #vaccinated and I've never had #COVID Part of my measures to stay safe - it's called 'common sense'. Same as Yellow Fever #vaccination when I travelled to countries listed below. #Covid_19 #Booster
0/-1	I've been vaccinated 3 times, but I don't see the point in compulsory vaccination. It does not prevent infection or transmission. Only those who do it voluntarily and to "protect" against severe courses should vaccinate themselves.
1/1	I've been waiting for this kind of video. I'm tired of fakenews and rumors about covid19 vaccines. I tried to explain the differences between mRNA and virusvector type...now I'll just show this video. Thanks.
1	I've been ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù for over one month and I survived it. Hard to believe, isn't it? You have to do your own research and decide for yourself whether the benefits outweigh the risks. Personally, I'd rather get the vaccine over getting CoVid any day.
1/1/1/1	I've completed the vaccines, so far no major side effect except for a mild fever and bodyache. Just get vaccinated guys
1/1	I've given getting the vaccine a lot of thought and I have done some research on the potential side effects. After weighing it all out in my head I have come to the conclusion that getting the vaccine outweighs the risk of going un- vaccinated. Yes there has to some people who have had adverse reactions to the vaccines but that risk is small compared to what COVID-19 will do to me. The lasting complications even if you recover from the virus is something that I don't want to live with. So while I might not feel completely safe getting vaccinated I still think it's a better alternative than getting infected with COVID-19 and im ready to get vaccinated now.
1/1	I've got 3 moderna shots ! And I feel fine.
0/0	I've got a question. Couldn't there be side effects that only appear in a few years? That's the only thing I'm sceptical about, but I'm no expert and I'd love to see an explanation to how safe it is and how you can guarantee me that I won't have some weird disease in a few years
0/1	I've got multiple family members in the medical field and all of them are constantly dealing with vaccinated people that have horrible side effects
1/1	I've got you shots I feel fine. There are no Guarantees in life. I'm sorry and pray for all those who died from COVID.
1/1	I've gotten the Moderna vaccine, I had very mild side effects, even more mild than my normal Influenza vaccine. I go back for my second dose on the 8th of February!
1/1	I've gotten the first one & have an appointment for the second on 2/19. No reaction except a slight headache to the first shot. I can't imagine not getting a vaccine against a lethal virus by which 473,182 people in the US have died in 11 months. None of them expected death
1/1	I've had 2 doses of vaccine and not caught anything since....but the tin foil brigade don't hear the positives.
1/1	I've had 3 now. 2 Pfizers and a Moderna. I'm going to book my 4th booster in Feb. I'll get as many as they'll let me. I want to not only protect myself but my friends and family too. It's the logical thing to do.
1	I've had COVID. 13 months ago. Fully vaccinated with Pfizer. Feel better now than I have in a year
1/1	I've had Johnson and Johnson 6 weeks out and no problem
0/0	I've had Omicron, it was very mild. Every day I am glad I steered clear of the so-called vaccines. Covid I couldn't avoid, blood clots and unknown long-term side-effects I could.
0/1	I've had a booster. I've had omicron. I'm done.
0/0	I've had a consistent forceful heartbeat and daily bouts of irregular heartbeats since having my first Pfizer vaccine back in April last year. I'm still waiting to get an echocardiogram for further investigation after having my symptoms dismissed for many months as anxiety. Naturally, I regret having the vaccine.
1/1	I've had all my vaccines from when I was a baby never got sick or had the flu or anything
1/1	I've had astra zeneca and im fine
1/1	I've had both my vaccinations. No effects after 1st one. Fatigued for a day or 2 after the 2nd with a mild headache. My dad died from covid last November. He died fighting for his breath in hospital. The vaccine came too late for him. I cannot understand anyone refusing.
1	I've had both my vaccines and the booster shot and think its important we protect ourselves and others around us!
1/1	I've had both of my vaccines and I really didn't have much of a reaction at all. Sore arm with the first shot and maybe a little tired with the second...that's it.
1/1	I've had both vaccines and a booster. i suffer from asthma. caught covid and was fine. no symptoms including lack of taste. my taste was fin
0/0	I've had covid with no vaccination and i'm still here.A miserable few days but I'm still here. Don't get vaccinated
0/0	I've had covid with no vaccination and i'm still here.A miserable few days but a stroll compared to the flu-real flu-which can be so awful that death feels like it would be a happy release.
1/-1	I've had mine and been fine.
1/1	I've had my 1st jab the side effects are horrible, feelings of happiness, getting my life back, the country at last coming out of this dark shadow hanging over it to name a few can't wait to get my 2nd might even go on holiday again and smile
1	I've had my first one today, no side effects so far lets face it, there is side effects to a lot of medications/vaccines. It has to be worth it if it gets rid of this Covid!
1/-1	I've had my first vaccine and was more than happy to do so but certainly wouldn't feel comfortable mixing them.
1/1	I've had my vaccine.. thank fuk..
0/0	I've had no vaccines, worked through pandemic in close contact with COVID patients and haven't developed even a sore throat!
1/1	I've had second dose of covid vaccine yesterday and you know what? I'm still perfectly alive and healthy, unlike my mom's friend who died from covid when she wasn't even old.
1/1	I've had several family members being in ICU because of covid. I will definietely get the vaccine!
1/1	I've had so many dreams in the past few months of getting a shot, and they were as uplifiting of a dream as I can imagine. Got my first one today and it wasn't quite as magical with confetti flying out of the air and all, it was still quite special.
1/1	I've had the astrazeneca vaccine and no noticeable effects at all
1/1	I've had the first of the Johnson &Johnson vaccines, I'm in the Ensemble 2 trial where they are doing two doses instead of one, two months apart. I had the first one a couple of weeks ago, and had a very strong reaction to it, it wasn't pleasant at all, and evidently wasn't the placebo! I missed work the following day , and it wasn't until 6 days later that my arm stopped hurting. But it was worth it.
1/1	I've had the pfiza vaccine. It gave me a dead arm feeling for a few days but apart from that I have had no problems.
1/1	I've had the two Pfizer shots and had no reaction except a slightly sore arm.
1/-1	I've had virus multiple times... all month long (January) 4 people tested positive, no terrible symptoms at all. 2 unvaccinated however we all had Covid before the vaccine
0/1	I've heard all kinds of things. It can give you aids. It's made with animal genetics and can change your dna and make you animal like. The government is just putting microchips in you. And the people who told me this 100% believe this and have read this online from people who have "researched" this and are "reputable".
1/1	I've heard it makes your male bits bigger and takes ten years off your face. Pass it on.
0/0	I've heard that the covid vaccines can affect fertility. I would never risk it.
1/1	I've just booked my COVID vaccine
1/0	I've just had a terrible side effect to the #OxfordVaccine #CovidVaccine I've come out with a degree!
0/1	I've just had my 2nd dose of the vaccine today at lunchtime unexpectedly, extra clinic put on as more Pfizer available to health care staff. Absolutely ecstatic to have had it. Again absolute no pain and feel fantastic x
1/-1	I've just missed going outside and see people in peace
0/0	I've known more people whose health for worse after the shot than before it.
1/1	I've learned that in that thing I went for a while. The school.... I had pretty strong side effects after Zeneca vaccine. Two days of fever, headache and pain in the arm. But that's perfectly normal. I know that my immune system kicked in.

0/0	I've never been against vaccinations in my life but I'm not trusting anything that's been rushed to production; especially not if it's coming out of Russia, China or the US

0/0	I've never ever had a flu shot and my last vaccines were in 1965. I have many allergies and I can't eat processed food. It makes me sick physically. There are to many questions and not enough proof that they are Safe.

0/0	I've never gotten any flu shots. For the past decade, never down with flu too. I grow my own herbs and I work from home. Do u want me to convince u to get ur own garden too? It has far better benefits (including anti cancer, blood cleansing, anti clotting properties etc) than a man made vaccine.
1/1	I've never had issues/bad side effects from vaccines so I've got no reason not to. Just like I've had the flu shot every year of my working life (because working in courthouses is pretty high risk for flu).
0/-1	I've never heard of anyone getting any adverse side effects let alone death from therapeutic levels of Vitamins D3, C, Zinc and Selinium.
0/0	I've never wanted a gun but I'm getting one now .They aren't getting my family with thier disgusting poison
1/1	I've now had both...the second one today, and yes, I'd say the vaccine I had has so far been both safe and effective. Honestly, I'ved never felt better.
1/1	I've now had my 3 shots and im happy i did, personally id take them again every time.
0	I've personally lost people from these vaccines. I've watched the youth, teenagers specifically develop blood clots and have seizures after getting the second doses, one of them who had a seizure did so while driving and crashed into a pole in a busy intersection.
1/1	I've read the info and believe in science, and I believed these vaccines were safe and effective basically for a while now. But this news... As someone who's parents are very high risk, it really confirms it for me. It gives me so much hope that they'll be safe once they receive their two doses. I feel more relief now than I did when I received my own doses.
1/1	I've received both shots of the vaccine from Moderna because of my first responder job. I can tell you from my experience that everyone's reaction to the vaccine will differ from person to person. The first shot only gave me a sore shoulder for about a day or so. The second shot I got I ended up getting a mild case of the flu. But some of my co-workers had gotten worst reactions from the first shot and mild reactions from the second shot.
0/0	I've reported this as terrorism. Government using the threat of violence to create fear.
0/0/0	I've researched plenty, and I won't be taking the experimental vax.
0/0	I've said America is doomed. America will never be the same again. Millions have been sold out. Biden will push trumps vax on everyone
1/0	I've said some things on YouTube that I've come to regret to be honest I don't think vaccines are bad but I do think people should have a choice whether to take them or not if they want to experience the virus or not is up to them and if they don't believe in vaccines that's fine everyone is entitled to their own
1/1	I've said some things on YouTube that I've come to regret to be honest I don't think vaccines are bad but I do think people should have a choice whether to take them or not if they want to experience the virus or not is up to them and if they don't believe in vaccines that's fine everyone is entitled to their own opinion so in my opinion people shouldn't be forced to get the coronavirus vaccine
0/0/0	I've seen enough. It's a strong no for me. If you still think it's safe, please search a bit more, you clearly still have no idea..
1/1	I've seen old, terminally ill people get the covid vaccine and not have any symptoms besides a sore arm. I, for one, am not worried.
0/0	I've seen so many videos saying we all should get it, but sorry to say I'm out and won't get the vaccine. Only God can tell whether or not its the end of my journey. Respect my pov. Thank you and please stay safe everyone!
1/1	I've seen so much vaccine disinformation, it really sucks. I got the J&J vaccine and had no side effects whatsoever.
0/0	I've served in the US army 12 years and won't take that vaccine if it costs me my military career
0/0	I've spent thousands of hours studying the "vaccines". I know much more about them than you do, because I put the work in, while you trust Pfizer, Fauci, Biden, Boris and whatever other Left Wing Rats you look up to over there in the UK. ALL major virologists agree "YOU CAN NOT VACCINATE YOUR WAY OUT OF A PANDEMIC". I will leave it to you do educate yourself on why that is true.
1/-1	I've spoken to perhaps a dozen people who've had the jab. None have told me which one they had and none of them have commented on any side effects other than a sore arm.
1/1	I've stopped trying to have conversations with anti vaxxers in real life. But at what point do they realize they've been hoodwinked? I get people who signed up and decide this is not the life they want and use this as a get out of the military free card. But the people who genuinely think they are making a principled choice baffle me. There have been billions of vaccines given out with very little problems and tremendous positives. Perhaps when covid is over and they get it in a year or two when there is a flair up?
1/1	I've subbed buddy, great video. How to drill this into the anti vaxxers is the next step!! Informative, amusing and well presented.
0/0	I've survived 10 months of being exposed to 10,000 people a day. I have no need for a vaccine now. You can keep it. as for employer mandates...not a difficult decision - employers are replaceable, my life is not.
1/-1	I've taken it myself but forcing it is utter tyranny!!!
1/1	I've taken the Vaccine three times in the last 7 months. I always wear a mask when I go out. Why? Because I'm elderly and love my family and those good people who don't wear a mask and don't get vaccinated are the ones who most spread the virus. I'm protecting myself and my family from you if you don't wear a mask or take the vaccine. I'm selfish and don't want you breathing in and out to put a virus I don't want in my body. Of course you don't mean to. And you don't want to. But when you shop you may have natural immunity and not know you carry the virus. You buy something in one aisle and walk away. The virus you breathed out hangs in the air for say, six to ten minutes. Someone else not wearing a mask comes along three minutes after you, and they can't see or smell the virus in the aisle and they breathe it into their body even though they really don't want the virus in their body. You don't know it, but you put the virus in their body. Even being vaccinated three times in 7 months, I still wear a mask and while it is wanting to protect me and my loved ones, I know that two people wearing masks and being vaccinated are the lowest chance of breathing in and out and giving it to others who may miss work, don't want to be sick, and in rare cases die. As a young man, I drove really drunk probably a hundred times. I felt I was sober enough to make it home, and back then the drunk driving law weren't as strict. I never had an accident. But now I realize I could have killed someone else and lived through it myself. There is no way to know if I or you gave the virus to someone who got sick or died. So to protect me and mine from those free not to wear a mask nor get the vaccine, I wear a mask and got the vaccine three times. And I'm still alive and have never been sick with Covid. Two people not wearing masks are the ones who most spread this virus and because of them, it could take ten years for the world to built herd immunity. I'm not morally better than those who don't wear a mask or vaccinate. I'm just being selfish and protecting myself from you people. I lost a good friend of 70 years and a strong Trump supporter who didn't wear a mask last year when I did. He was a good person and a Christian and very politically conservative. The Doctor told his widow that it was not Covid alone that killed my long time friend. It was the combined Covid and his diabetes. I'm sure whoever was healthy but carrying the virus will never know that they are the person who put that evil virus into my friends body causing his premature death. Simply breathing in and out. There is no way to know who it was But it has to be someone carrying the virus and not wearing a mask. No way around that. Even being vaccinated I could still give the virus to someone who doesn't want it in their body. So I still wear a mask. Take care and be safe.
1/1	I've taken the vaccine shots. So far no problems. I took it because I have personally known two people that have died from covid
1/1	I've wondered if those who had Covid should get the vaccine. I want to get mine ASAP. Data from SARS COV1 shows immunity 17 years after infection.
0/-1	I've work through the whole thing, never even had a cold. My IMMUNE SYSTEM WORKS!!
0/0	I've yet to heard any good reasons to get it. My old granny who is 84 and said it was like a mild cold. Why would anyone healthy get it? Apparently you can still catch after you get vaccine? It is "safe" this is coming from the guys who shamed everyone not to wear masks then flipped flopped a few weeks later. Did everyone forget that? I thought well if doctors are wearing them wouldn't they work for the average joe? Now they want us to wear two masks lol. On the CDC website it says you have to spend 15 minutes in front of someone to catch it and to stay six feet apart unless you walk into a school than three feet is fine. Maybe people don't want to get the vaccine is because it seems like the "experts" really don't know what they are talking about. Not even mentioning some vaccines are only 79% effective for a virus that has a 99.7 survival rate and a FEW people have gotten really sick or even died from them. I think I'll take my chances.

1/0	I,m just worried if its safe or not. They keep saying it is, but how do they know not being anywhere near the TWO YEARS it usually takes to get a vaccine. Short cuts are needed for under TWO years, I will be happy to take it Sept 2022 subject to those taking it now still being functional & producing normal children.

0	IM A NURSE THE FACT IS THEY NEVER SHOULD HAVE HAD MASS VACCINATION IN A PANDEMIC. THIS AND THIS ALONE CREATES THE DIFFERENT STRAINS OF COVID!!! FACT AND IF SOMEONE IN THE MEDICAL FIELD TELLS YOU THIS ISNT TRUE THEY ARE LYING TO YOU!!!!!!! I AM A NURSE WHO WORKS IN INFECTIOUS DISEASE.
0/0	IM FROM AREA 51 THE ALIAN BASE NEVADA IM THE BIG BOSS DO NOT TAKE THE VACINE
1/1	IM GETTING MY VACCINE TODAY
0/0	IM NOT an anti-vax person, but I will not be taking the vaccine for at least a year or two.
1/1	IMHO - if you choose not to vaccinate, you choose not to be treated in a hospital when you get COVID. You get sent to the equivalent of leper colony for 30 days to hang out without masks, without federally funded healthcare, without doctors or nurses (unless they volunteer) until you test free from COVID.
1/1	IMO people are leaving themselves wide open for a higher rate of covid fatality/long covid side effects over a rather big "IF" the vaccines even have any long term effects. I can't remember a time when people ignored known medical threats for what may come down the line.

1/1/1/1	Idk why people are scared of mRNA, its exciting new technology & times, and is the natural human progression in vaccines
1/0	Idk. Some people didn‚Äôt want it I know that much. If was allowed to I woulda got it.
0/0	If 'Covid' is as dangerous as you suggest and I've done nothing of what you've advised, why the f*ck am I still here, well, healthy and thriving?! You promote the 'urgency' to get vaxxed for my 'own safety'. But how urgent is urgent? Seems plausible you're lying over something
0/0	If 1 infection = 1 vaccine what is the point of the vaccine? You have 2 hours
0/0	If 87000 Dutch nurses refuse to take the vaccine, because they do not want to be guinea pigs, why should you take it?
1/1	If AIDS spreads quicker like this, you guys will also have a vaccine of it in a year I bet.
1/1	If BBC says it's safe then it is! Every one please listen to them . They care so much about us. Thank you BBC ‚ù§
0	If Bill Gates gave me all his entire wealth to take one of his depopulation shots, I would still vehemently decline. Forever. I can not be bought.

0/0	If COVID wasn‚Äôt advertised by the media I would never know that there was a ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù.

1/-1	If Hitler comes back from Hell to tell American antivaxxers that vaccines are actually good, what would be the percentage of Antivaxxers getting fully vaccinated?
1/1	If I can dumb it down that much, I don‚Äôt know why people have to be so scared of it.
1/1/1	If I can get a one shot in any of the months in spring, I will be more then pleased
1/1/1	If I can get my life back that‚Äôs fine with me. Had the first jab already. Bring it on !
1/1	If I can't get the virus, I can't spread it that's why I want to be immune.
0/0	If I can't hold someone accountable for a product that can hurt me then I don't have to take it period dot.
0/0	If I can't sue the company, that's a rap itself.
1/1	If I could I would take 3
1/1	If I could get the first vaccines I would. I caught the virus, and spent 9 days in the hospital.
1/1/1/1	If I could get the first vaccines I would. I caught the virus, and spent 9 days in the hospital. Would be nice if you had a section here, talking about what goes wrong if the vaccine is not safe. Pretty sure these 2 vaccines will get approved by FDA.
1/1/1/1	If I could, I would have taken the phase 3 trials. I'd be the first in whatever line for the vaccine.
1/1	If I could, I would take the vaccine 100 times over again
0/0	If I do it, it will only be for the practical reasons and not because I believe it is actually important to get vaccinated.
0/-1	If I don‚Äôt take the vaccine, it doesn‚Äôt effect you. I can still transmit covid with the shot, so why does it matter to everyone that I get something that doesn‚Äôt even do it‚Äôs job.
1/1	If I get another booster, can't everyone stay 12 feet farther away? #GetVaxxed
0/0	If I go into hospital I going to ask for unvaccinated doctor See how that fairs
1/0	If I go outside I will get autism so I don't do it
1/1	If I had parents at a nursing home and a nursing home worker working there refused vaccination I would want the nursing home to let that employee go immediately.
1/1	If I had to choose between being vaccinated or the possibility of getting the virus, then I choose vaccination!
1/1	If I had young kids I‚Äôd get them vaccinated. It‚Äôs not even a question
1/0	If I have any people on my list that refuse to take the vaccine please put my name down instead of yours on that appointment. I will sell my soul to the Devil so you don't have to!

1/1	If I have to get the third dose I‚Äôll get it without complaint. I hope others do the same
0/0	If I have to wear a mask I am not getting a vaccine.
0/0	If I haven't even had the flu in 40 years, and hardly been sick in such a long time, I can't remember when, than why would I want to take a vaccine for covid...that would stupid, my immune system is good enough!!
1/1	If I hear any pharmacy threw out COVID vaccines because Hinshaw said so I am going to lose my goddamn mind.
0/0	If I look up and see vaccine companies STOPPING vaccinations because there is not enough. I will say THAT IS BACKWARDS! If you dont have enough you dont need to stop using the ones you have. Thats a lie. MOST people dont want it! They are closing a lot of centers, this makes the small percent of people that do want it have to wait in LONG LINES.....This increases interest. Just like buying a tickle me elmo, or any other product. To ME they are stopping for one real reason. So they can get as many people to take it at ONCE. No time to have enough people show the results. People are already being silenced. Once they get it down, the left will be next. They can already have 50% of the country tagged as againtst it and censor people in a literal second.
1/1	If I need a 3rd dose, I will be first in line! People need to quit whining and making this political because you are literally killing yourselves. Getting a vaccine doesn't have to be a big deal!
0/0	If I needed a reason not to take the vaccine this was it
1/1/1/1	If I read the research on the vaccine and I thought it was sound, I would take it.
1/1	If I remember the original study, the authors were making the claim that since the vaccine gives some people a headache and since neurological disorders can include headaches, then the vaccine must cause neurological disorders. It was the dumbest sort of non scientific conclusion. It was authored by a guy trying to sell alternative medicine treatments, a known antivaxer and a dentist. Brilliant.
1/1	If I was provided clear facts, I will agree to be vaccinated.
0/0	If I were ever to receive this on live national television, I'd start shaking and fall out of my chair
0/0	If I were you, I'd think before doing something so rash
0/0	If I worked for someone who was willing to sack me for not taking this experimental jab. I would be off sick with stress until I found a new job.
0/1	If I'm a front-line health worker, I'll accept partial immunity. Safety is the most important thing.
1/0	If I'm about to be locked in a cell full of other people with coronavirus and not much medical care, then yes, please give me an untested vaccine first.
1/0	If I'm being honest, "vaccine doubters among the staff" of a medical facility kind of terrifies me.
1	If I'm going to get a vaccine, I would prefer one that has the best outcome against COVID.
0/0	If I‚Äôm forced to get a vaccine just kill me because I‚Äôm not getting it.
1/1	If Natural immunity is so good then why is my nice going thru her third bout. She's unvaxed. Funny cause she keeps getting sick while those vaxed around her don't.
1/1	If They Are An Intelligent And Rational Person They Will Take It.
0/1	If a 1 in 10^6 probability of dangerous side effects prevents you from taking a vaccine, have I got news about not wearing a mask during an unnecessary trip to the grocery store.
1/1	If a 3rd vacine or annual booster is necessary to get COVID under control, save lives and get life back to normal, I will gladly do it.
0/-1	If a Politian had to choose between one vaccine and one placebo on a table they would walk away.
0/0	If a company has been granted immunity against any lawsuits in the future for any possible long term side effects of the vaccine then eh... count me out!
0/0	If a jab for each variant is the path forward, the vaxxed are all gonna have the arms of a heroin addict in 2-3 years. No need for papers, just pull up your sleeves.
1/1	If a person has been infected with SARS CoV2 and is still carrying anti covid antibodies, they are probably protected about as good as a person who has been vaccinated. There is conflicting data as to whether natural infection or vaccine-mediated infection is more efficacious against future infection, but pretty much everyone agrees that vaccination after natural infection confers the greatest degree of immunity.
1/1	If a person is anti-vaccine, they should be made to suffer, axiomatically. It's not even in terms of practicality, just morally, I think they should suffer. We already lock people up for murdering. With the state the world is in right now, you‚Äôre lucky we don‚Äôt arrest people for not getting vaccinated. Listen, it‚Äôs a global pandemic, people need to get vaccinated to stop the global pandemic, as long as they keep not getting the vaccine, thousands of people are going to die. Sorry, but if you disagree, that‚Äôs a (You) problem. And it‚Äôs not authoritarian because if you‚Äôre unvaccinated without a really good medical justification, you‚Äôre breaking the social contract and violating the freedoms of other individuals. The kids of anti-vax parents should be separated and the state should take care of them. That probably won‚Äôt happen, but it should. We should also have a human rights crimes tribunal for all the large media and political figures that have engaged in vaccine and covid-denialism.
1/1	If a vaccine becomes available that has passed all clinical trials and has been proven safe and effective, and half the population refuses to take it...that just means my family and I will be able to get ours sooner.
0/0	If a vaccine injuries you or kills you the company who makes that vaccine are not responsible and are not liable. There is no guarantee that you will not get coronavirus or spread it after getting a vaccine
0/0	If a vaccine injuries you or kills you the company who makes that vaccine are not responsible and are not liable. There is no guarantee that you will not get coronavirus or spread it after getting a vaccine. The vaccine is also made with aborted fetal tissue. And for all of these reasons I will never receive a coronavirus vaccine ever.
0/0	If a vaccine was needed the government would not need to advertise or promote it.
1/0	If a vaccine works with your immune system, why give it to someone who has a poor immune system, as is being suggested ?
0/0	If a whole country decided to not wear masks. shutdown. lockdown... what percentage of the population do you think would die in a year? If you said 0%. you are correct. Sweden's All death total increased by 6.994 in 2020. Sweden has a population of 10.380.245. That is a 0.06% population hit in 2020... Thank you for ending the ' ' pandemic ' ' with a monumental case study Sweden!
0/0/0/0/0/0	If all the people that want the vaccine take it and they are "safe" then my freedom to deny the vaccine won't hurt you... you're immunized.
0/0	If all the vulnerable are vaccinated, and I being young and healthy are still capable of being infectious even if the vaccine keeps my symptoms down, why do I need vaccinating again?
0/0	If all vaccines are safe and save lives.... So why the legal immunity from vax damage then???
0/-1	If an individual has an adverse effect or dies 13 days after their second vaccination, this is classified as an unvaccinated non-COVID death, and apparently many who die post vaccine, do so in this time period. So, would this not effect the entire data set? Also, the exclusion criteria in this study is death 30 days outside COVID illness or a SARS-Cov-2 test positivity. Would this also not effect the results regarding non-COVID
0/0	If anti vaccine means keeping an open mind and considering multiple different treatment methods in addition to the vaccine, then everyone ought to be anti vaccine
1/1	If antivaxxers do not take the vaccine, normal people MUST take the vaccine.
1/1/1/1	If antivaxxers don‚Äôt take the vaccine, normal people MUST take the vaccine.
1/1	If any anti vaxxers get Covid and are seriously ill, just leave them to it.

0/0/0/0	If anybody out there truly cares for there kids please wonder what the hell is in that needle
0/0/0/0	If anyone "forces" anything on me, I will defend myself to my last dying breath.
1/0	If anyone ever took more than 2 seconds to read into the pause of the J&J vaccine, it was only 6 rare cases out of the 6 million doses given. Stop feeding into the antivax agenda
0/0	If anyone in my family is harmed by one of these vaccines Bill Gates and Fauci are going to be the virus that gets eliminated.
1/0	If anyone takes this gene therapy. Then you are absolutely crazy or scared to death because you have watched too much mainstream. Cv19 does not pass koch's postulates therefore never proven to exist. Exosomes are really viruses. The pcr test has been manipulated and can find anything in anybody given enough cycles. Says Kary Mullis the creator... Full armour
0/0	If anyone threatens to harm me or my family and force a vaccine it will be them in a domino crash I'm not even playing. Whoever's behind them is next.
0/1	If anyone who wanted the vaccine has gotten it, what difference does it make now?
0/-1	If anything happens, the scout corps are ready. Dont worry
1/1	If anything has convinced me there's a mental health crisis in the US, it's the antivaxxer comments I find on videos like this.
0/0	If anything they would be begging ANY worker to work in the hospitals during a REAL pandemic, But of course they have to discriminate because Vaccine comes first before saving lives‚Ä¶
0/-1	If by vaccine you mean a rushed chemical that will most likely be even more dangerous than the actual virus.
0/0	If companies who created vaccines dont take liabilities for after effects, why the hell we should take it.
1/1	If covid doesn‚Äôt scare you then dying alone in a hospital without being able to see family or friends as you pass should. The only person there will be a nurse who‚Äôs tired going off a 16 hour shift and you‚Äôre just another statistic. That trip to the hospital could be the last time you see the outdoors and you don‚Äôt even see it coming
0/0	If covid mutates to that level then the vaccine is stupid anyway since the virus will just mutate and get around the vaccine....
0/0	If distancing worked why masks? If masks worked why distancing? If both worked why lockdowns? If kockdowns worked why vaccines? If vaccines work why vaxx manufacturers are exempt from responsibility?
0/-1	If don‚Äôt talk to people who get the vaccine. Stupid sheep.
1/1	If enough people are vaccinated, we can prevent 100,000 deaths or more.
1/1	If enough people refuse the vaccine so we don't reach herd immunity we're never going to kill this thing, so yeah. You refuse the vaccine, we refuse you entry... simple.
0/0	If enough sheeple get the vaccine then that means I won't have to.
1/1	If every antivaxxer on the planet died nothing of value would be lost
1/1	If everybody will just go and get the vaccine and the booster shot every year we can make sure Covid will always be around like the flu.
0/0	If everyone around me has had the vaccine they will all be immune, which means I cannot catch the lurgy from them so I won't need to have the vaccine myself √∞≈∏Àú≈†
0/0	If everyone else is getting the shot then I don‚Äôt need it
1/1	If everyone gets vaccinated then we could go back to a much more normal life!
1/1	If everyone got it, 90% is basically herd immunity anyways. Everyone won't get it, but now people will have a much lower chance of getting it than without. It's better than anything else we've been doing.
0/0	If everyone has to take a vaccine for it to work what good is it?
1/-1	If everything goes well, there might be an effective vaccine in less than 18 months‚Äîthe fastest a vaccine has ever been developed. That will depend on decisions we make today, including the federal government investing in building up manufacturing capacity.
0	If evidence emerges of long-term negative health consequences, don‚Äôt be surprised if it‚Äôs ignored and suppressed. Like the link between the exponential increase in childhood vaccinations and the concomitant rise in autism.
1/0	If frontline NHS staff don't need jabs neither does ANYONE else. LEAVE OUR KIDS ALONE
0/0	If he‚Äôs taking credit for convincing kids to get vaccinated, he needs to be held responsible for it when consequences are delivered.
0	If i had to choose between covid & the vaccine, covid her I come baby
0/0/0/0/0	If immunity lasts few months after a covid illness, how do we know that an individual's immunity after this vaccine will sustain longer?
1/1	If injecting it through your dickhole was the only option, I'd still do it. Anything to return to normalcy. Or at least as normal as we can make it again.
1/1	If it 90% effective but they could inject it into my eye id still take it in a heartbeat
0/0/0/0	If it becomes "mandatory", I'll just pay the nurse to shoot it in the sink and record that I had it. I'm never accepting this fraud.
1/1	If it comes to my country I will take it gratefully. Without a second thought
1/-1	If it gets bad in the winter, think of it this way: We had a limited time in the summer to rapidly test vaccines using the many many volunteers for human challenge trials, and we squandered it, but at least some counterfactual worlds out there are doing great!
1/1	If it gets the world to near normal what's the issue! I cant wait to get jabbed so I can play my part in helping my industry back to work. Too many good people in the entertainment industry struggling at the moment.
0/0	If it has any aborted fetus tissue at all I'll never touch it regardless of what the pope says. Honestly I'd likely never get it anyway though
1/0	If it is proven that the vaccines safe for me, I'll be first in line
0/0	If it is so "safe and effective" why are so many people getting really bad adverse reactions, and why are so many dying after getting the injections??? Also now, the CDC and WHO have agreed that hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin are very effective and safe at curing you from Covid-19.
0/0	If it is so safe... then go ahead and make the manufacturers of the vaccines liable for side effects.
0/0	If it is supposedly harmless then why did my sister almost die after getting vaxed?
0/0	If it is tested then would you know in the results that it is safe for upcoming generations if it's effect starting after so many years then how we take it safe today.
0/0	If it isn‚Äôt a permanent immunization, then it‚Äôs not a vaccine.
1/1	If it keeps you out of hospital and dying its doing well Better than not any vaccine at all...... Some will always use any news to be negative to forward their own petty agenda It's time for all of us to focus on the positives for society as a whole.
1/1/1	If it makes it past FDA with appropriate screening, proper Phase I/II/III trials/metas, then yes.
1/1	If it makes yall feel better, all the stupid people will get covid and die, so stupidity levels will be lowered...
0/0	If it was about health, they would have mandated exercise and dieting years ago.
0/0	If it was either safe or worked ,they wouldn't have to constantly say it was safe and it works. On a side note,thousands of domestic flights shut down due to all the jabbed airline staff getting new variant.....
0/0	If it was such a gtreat idea, then why are they wanting to force everyone to do it? Usually if something is good and great people will do it without force.
1/1	If it wasn‚Äôt for the risk of them infecting vulnerable people I would say that anti-vaxers are part of nature‚Äôs great plan for natural selection.
1/1	If it wasn‚Äôt for the vaccine, I would have been hit hard with Covid! I am glad I have the vaccine!!!
0/0	If it were really so good, at least one developed country would have approved it. Why no approval from US and UK?
0/0	If it weren't for the politicians, I'd be more obliged to get a vaccination. But their lies, incompetence and confusion as to why I'm being punished for not having a jab has gladly stopped me
0/1	If it will give me my freedom back, I'm all 4 it.
0/0/0	If it worked and was safe, you wouldn‚Äôt need to mandate, force, deceive, or threaten people who question it...

0/0	If it worked why do it so many times over and over? Naaaa you keep it
0/0	If it worked, mandates wouldn‚Äôt be a part of the discussion.
1/1	If it works, who cares where it's from.
0/0	If it's safe, then why can't we sue the manufacturer if we have a severe reaction or vaccine injury
0/0	If it's safe, why are the vaccine companies refusing to be held liable legally in case their vaccine causes damage to the people who receive it?
0/0	If it's so effective, why all the booster shots? If it's so safe, why are people having so many bad side effects?
0/0	If it's so safe how come the UK government has had to give Pfizer immunity from being sued, can anyone answer me that, it doesn't look good
0/0	If it's so safe then why does it have a ton of side effects?
0/0	If it's so safe, why does the vaccine injury compensation program exist? Vaccines are poisonous!
1/1	If its proven to be safe and effective YES. We need to keep ourselves and others safe! The anti vaxxers are unscientific and vast majority crazy!
1/1	If it‚Äôs 75% effective in stopping the spread AND you have essentially zero chance of severe covid, it will be very useful.
1/1	If it‚Äôs the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine there‚Äôs absolutely zero possibility they got sick from it. Also, both take two doses given two weeks apart for it to be effective. They got infected from someone, most likely one of the people administering the vaccine or employee of the nursing home.
0/0	If mRNA vaccines are that safe, why did the US Congress pass a law that the companies cannot be sued for any adverse reactions?
0/0	If mandating vaccines was actually about health...Then why not mandate healthy eating? Why not mandate exercise? Because it's not about health. It's about money, power and control by way of forced medical intervention!!!
0/0	If medical professionals don't trust the vaccine why should I trust it?
1/1	If multiple vaccines become available, I wonder if getting all of them over time might increase your immunity over just one.
0/0	If my ancestors never use vaccine why me?
1/1/1/1	If my country is not available to get vaccine yet , could I travel to which country to get it?, thanks

1/1	If no vaccines are effective why is it that my great aunt died of diphtheria in the year of 1911, but in recent years individual deaths are named. The difference a vaccination and an antitoxin.

0/0	If only covid vaccines works on preventing infection then I wouldn't be here in this subreddit. Lockdown again
0/0/0	If only everyone will comply and just take the jab, followed by endless booster jabs, than we can have a little normalcy back. Seems obvious the whole world is held hostage by an international cabal pushing their 1 world order.

1/1	If only some people knew the effects of usual drugs we take n we deem safe they would receive the vaccines without making bogus statements when they know nothing to do with effects of drugs they take n think are safe.... Take the vaccines or leave it who loses
1	If only there had been something they could have done to stay alive‚Ä¶ oh wait, THERE WAS. I feel sorry for their families, they lost a loved one because they were too stupid to save their own lives, but not for them. Their ignorance and selfishness clogged up the hospital system and deprived others who did the right thing of healthcare and put others at risk.
1/1	If only there had been something we could have done to stay alive‚Ä¶ oh wait, THERE IS. It is called VACCINE.

0/0	If others are vaccinated, and the vaccine is so great and works so well, why does it matter if YOU are vaccinated?! This whole thing is absolutely ridiculous
1/1	If people are afraid of the vaccine (any vaccine) just put them aside and keep jabbing arms. We want our younger people to start getting vaccinated.
0/0/0	If people are ignorant enough to continue taking these poisonous vaccines, they deserve what they get, plain and simple.
0/0	If people can still spread it with any of the increasing number of vaccines, then how can you say that the problem is that not EVERYONE on the planet is vaxxed? It's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
1/1	If people continue wearing masks and vaccinated, restrictions shouldn't be as tight. Looking at Taiwan, Japan, Korea, and Hong Kong
1/1	If people dont want the vaccine thats ok , but when they cant travel , go to festivals, eat out etc , tough
0/0	If people get jabbed after watching this, they are beyond saving
1/1/1/1	If people had this same negative energy around the corinvirunus vaccine, with all the other past vaccines. We'd all be dead.
0/0	If people in the health care field have reservations about this vaccine, that's all I need to know. I'd rather take my chances with a virus that has an over 99% survival rate.
1/-1	If people keep traveling from country to country it will never end.

1/-1	If someone claims the covid vaccines are gene therapy, they simply don't know what they are talking about and you need read no further. The definition of gene gene therapy is "the introduction of normal genes into cells in place of missing or defective ones in order to correct genetic disorders." the vaccines do not introduce genes to replace missing or defective genes, the introduced genes code for the covid virus spike protein and it is not introduced to correct a genetic disorder, Fulfill
0/0	If someone dies from taking the vaccine they will blame in on covit 19
0/0	If someone dies from the jab is it considered a covid 19 death? Or are you guys going to blame it on a new variant.

1/1	If such a small virus can reach underprivileged peoples why not vaccine? It is everyone‚Äôs responsibility to make sure that it reaches far beyond virus has reached .
1/1/1/1/1/1/1/0	If taking the vaccine means I can go back to living my life, sign me up. I‚Äôll take 6.
0/0/0	If that is not enough to get you convinced, nothing will, you are doomed. View the film VAXXED asap. Get on board with the anti-vaccination mouvement before its too late.
0/0	If the "virus" has over 99.7% recovery rate and the "vaccine" which is a sort of gene therapy does not offer immunity and does not stop the transmission, what's the point?

1/1/1	If the Americans don't want it, send it to other countries. We'll gladly accept the vaccines
0/0	If the Aust government refuses to set up a safety net for its citizens to take the fast-tracked COVID vaccines, that has proved to be risky with harmful side effects, according to overseas data, then we can refuse to take such vaccines. I consent to nothing! #novax for me!
1	If the CDC can approve emergency use the FDA could approve it as well. That is the only one that I believe.
0/0	If the COVID 19 vaccines are safe, why were companies like Pfizer and Moderna given total immunity from liability under the PREP Act? Count me OUT! TRY TO FORCE ME! You are part of the lie
0/0	If the COVID vaccines were so safe and effective, why doesn't the FDA take them out of Emergency Use Authorization and approve them outright? One difference between EUA and outright approval is that under EUA, vaccine makers can't be sued for adverse effects. The most financially lucrative move for Pfizer and Moderna would be to lobby governments to impose vaccine mandates and sell large quantities of vaccines without liability.
0/0	If the Economist really wanted to get the Vaccines they would demand that the civil liability shield on the big pharma vaccine producers be removed so that ordinary people can sue when they get severe side effects from their experimental products.

0/1	If the body's immune system is capable of recognizing the virus based on its spike proteins, why would we need to synthetically create them?
0/0	If the covid vaccine is safe then why are there no liabilities
0/0	If the criteria for safety (for vaccines) is measured in time how on earth can you deem somethng safe when the trials are months instead of the usual 10 to 15 years. This will backfire on them, they are waking up more than any truther channel ever could with their lies and socialist censorship.
1/1	If the deniers and downvoters could understand reality and get vaccinated, we could get back to normal and save a lot of lives.
0/0	If the development of these vaccines is one of the best accomplishments of science in recent memory, scientists have been slacking.
1/1	If the experts recommend it, yes. I've had that shit once; I don't want it again. To everyone who says no; make sure y'all skip your tetanus boosters as well. No point after all in a booster shot, right?
0/0	If the federal government continues to enforce vaccine mandates, as Republicans AGAINST medical tyranny, we cannot continue to vote to fund this government. It's that simple.

0/0	If the vaccination is mandate in schools, my kids will be home schooled
0/0	If the vaccine can‚Äôt do anything why take it? I‚Äôm not taking it at all I‚Äôm just trying to ask ppl out here
0/0	If the vaccine doesn't prevent one from spreading or from contracting the virus neither does it free people from putting on face masks nor reduce social distances between individuals, I haven't any convincing reason why people should take it
0/0	If the vaccine doesn‚Äôt protect 100% , and you can still get the COVID after vaccination, why get it at all? It‚Äôs ridiculous and even dangerous. Nobody knows how our body is going to react with getting the vaccine. It‚Äôs not only bad for allergic people, as for we don‚Äôt know what damage to our body it can cause in the long term. No research can be done in a short term. I‚Äôm concern
0/0	If the vaccine has no significant effect on severe illness what exactly does it do ?
0/0/0/0	If the vaccine is 95% effective and I already have a 99.99% chance of recovering within 4 days if I get COVID why would I need the vaccine?
0/0	If the vaccine is a choice,this whole bs is so contradictory and unethical!
1/1	If the vaccine is all need to take to be able to travel again, sign me up.
1/1	If the vaccine is killing people then we are in serious trouble as most of our front line workers and medical personnel have taken the vaccine. I have had coovid19 and I am still getting the vaccine. I believe that our medical experts would not have mostly gotten the vaccine if it was dangerous. They are much more educated than me and if they feel it is safe for themselves and their family then I will trust their judgement.
1/1/1/1	If the vaccine is meets the approval of top immunologists and epidemiologists, then no doubt about it.
0/0	If the vaccine is safe, why did two of the FDA's top scientists step down a week after Pfizer's COMIRNATY was licensed?
0/0	If the vaccine is so effective and successful, then why do we have more cases now than before the vaccine roll-out?
0/0	If the vaccine is so safe then they shouldn't need liability protection
0/0/0	If the vaccine is so safe, then why it's soo free? Doesn't make sense. The government always tax u for something soo safe right üòÖ
1/1	If the vaccine is tested and shown to be effective, then how fast it was produced is irrelevant.
0/0	If the vaccine it's as effective as they say it is, why "they" are so concerned about the unvaccinated people? Is this makes any sense?
1/1	If the vaccine protection against symptomatic infections linked to Omicron "is much weaker" than against the Delta variant, "the recall still makes it possible to significantly reduce the risk", confirms the DREES.
0/0	If the vaccine protects the person that‚Äôs been vaccinated then why do they care if we take it or not?ü§î
1/1	If the vaccine rollout has been a masterclass in incompetency, then the public health campaign that should have been running to promote confidence and takeup of the vaccines has been a total disaster.
0/-1	If the vaccine triggers an immune response than for the people that have had it why do they recommend getting the vaccine?... your body will have built up immunity to Covid .. sounds fishy ! I know many people including health care workers are not getting it
0/0	If the vaccine was as effective as they claim they wouldn‚Äôt want to wait 55 years before they tell how good it is.
0/0	If the vaccine was so safe then the FDA should approve it. This will never happen because everyone is a research subjectüôÑ
0/0	If the vaccine was so safe, why are the vaccine pharmaceutical companies exempt from any lawsuit as the result of any side effects?
0/0	If the vaccine was working so well you wouldn't need to change my mind. Also I am still unvaccinated and I been living my life like normal. Traveled, been to raves, bars, casino's and still haven't caught any t variant of covid. Not saying covid isn't real but I feel for most people it really isn't an issue.
0/0/-1/0	If the vaccine works but I don't want it in my body, would you be offended?
0/0/0/0	If the vaccine works then everyone who took it shouldn't have to worry about us poor bastards that didn't. If it mutates by the month (maybe week) like it has been then it still doesn't matter. Funny how that works.

0/0	If there is a question this shot is dangerous why take it? The world has gone insane in love with the vaccine for no reason
1/1	If there is a vaccine for it, I have it.
0/0	If there is a vaccine there's gonna be side effects that we don't know about
1/1	If there is no reaction to the first dose, there is little risk of serious side effects from the second.

0/0	If there's risk, there must be choice.
0/0	If there‚Äôs one thing history has taught us, it‚Äôs that we can always trust Politicians, Media, and Big Pharma! Hooray!
0/0	If these agencies actually were serious about the safety of these vaccines, they would never have put them on the market. They have not been adequately tested. No one knows the long-range effects, or even short-term effects, apparently. Anyone who takes these vaccines is nothing more than an unpaid, unprotected, guinea pig.
0/0	If these pharmaceutical corporations are going to protect themselves from litigation in case of injury and or death from their vaccines, I‚Äôll protect myself by not taking it
0/0	If these pharmaceutical corporations are going to protect themselves from litigation in case of injury and or death from their vaccines, I‚Äôll protect myself by not taking it.
0/0	If these vaccines are so effective, why are there reports of a third and fourth wave? Things that make you go hmmmm.
0/0	If these vaccines are so safe .. why are the companies producing them given immunity from prosecution when a few years down the line the shtf ?
0/0/0/0/0	If these vaccines are so safe why is the FDA and these companies who make these vaccines protected from any lawsuits and liability for 2 years? If any company is not held accountable for their products then I don't want it.
0/0	If they are "safe and effective" why are the manufacturer's granted legal protection from injuries and death? 'Asking for a friend.'
1/1	If they are 16 or older they should get it. I wish my son could get it at 15. I have tried to find a trial but have not been successful.
1/1	If they are not vaccinated by now‚Ä¶.consider them lost.
0/0	If they are pushing it this hard, something is fishy about this shot. I think I'll pass and wait like 100 years to see the side effects.
0/0	If they are so successful then why are the manufacturers trying to keep their data secret for decades?
0/0	If they are that safe the these companies should have zero problems with taking all responsibility with them! Right now they get a free pass! Also we still have little data on long term side effects down the road!
1/1	If they aren‚Äôt vaccinated by now, they probably aren‚Äôt going to do it, unless someone close to them dies or someone gets long COVID.
1/1	If they can do this well, vaccinating enough people would stamp out the disease.
1/1	If they can roll this out fast enough then good. Is it possible to get one of the other vaccines later down the line when they are more available.
1/1	If they don't get vaccinated then don't let them into our countries. Just as those that choose not to be vaccinated in the UK should not be permitted to travel outside of the UK
1/0	If they don't want a jab, then they become ill and perhaps die. Simples!
1/1	If they don't want it and they suffer ill effects of covid, unlucky for them. The vulnerable who could contract it from the unimmunised, should be vaccinated. So, in theory only the sceptics will suffer. They made their choice. Darwinism has gotten us this far :).
1/1	If they don't want it then don't give it to them. When they catch covid don't treat them.
1/1	If they don't want to get vaccinated fine, i'll gladly take the shot
1/1	If they dont want it we ll take it .just please hurry up lol
1/1	If they don‚Äôt want it don‚Äôt take it. stop telling everybody else their views, it‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs own choice, I choose yes, my choice.
1/1	If they gave me a choice it's J&J. Either way works for me
1/1	If they get sick I hope they learn their lesson and If they die then hopefully their Facebook group with their Karen‚Äôs can learn from it as well
1/1	If they have to continue making stuff up to scare people, it just proves the vaccine is safe and effective.
0/0	If they love transparency, release the FOIA act documents, and accept liability from harm.

1/1/0	If they say they have to inject it directly into my bollocks so I can do shit again then so be it
0/0	If they try I will fight back however I have to. I still have medical rights to refuse treatment.
1/1	If they were smart they'd go get vaccinated and be grateful they live in a 1st world country with access.
1/1	If they won't take the vaccine and keep using conspiracy theories, then they should be denied a hospital bed if they get sick. That is the consequence for endangering other people's lives.
0/0	If they're forcing you to take the vaccine this is control like Hitler and this is really Satan..
1/0	If they're scared of a little needle and unwilling to obey those above them, then they're not good sailors anyway.
0/0	If they're so safe and effective, why is old Biden still walking around masked everywhere virtual signaling after taking it (a clean one he was given I'm sure, or possibly a saline solution). They can't deny the fact that there are no liability wavers they'll sign in case there are long term effects, and they can't deny there are zero long term studies or tests on their experimental gene therapy. How do these people know that splicing and inserting genes from things like Jellyfish and putting into the human body has no unforeseen consequences. WE DON'T KNOW SHIT. Natural antibodies ftw, that's all you need. ESPECIALLY in regards to a flu-like illness that barely affects 99% of people. Don't forget old unhealthy Trump survived it.
1/1	If they're that stupid not to take the vaccine let them get the virus.
1/-1	If this covid 19 virus keeps going on for more time or years I think any covid 19 medication for the young kids or babies should be invented or available because you know the kids and babies are more sensitive than the adults and probably they can't handle a vaccination in the arm
1/1	If this is accurate, do so. This vaccine is important to eradicate COVID-19. Please, it‚Äôs just a pinch and it doesn‚Äôt cause mental diseases
1/1	If this is how my body reacts to the shot, I can't imagine how terrifying and painful contracting actual covid would be. So glad I'll be all protected by moving day.
1/1	If this moment doesn‚Äôt symbolize hope for the future of our country, I don‚Äôt know what does. New chapter of healing and progress.
1/1	If this really works as well as they say it will I will gladly take it. These people will be / are heroes, this could save so many lives and end this nightmare! We really need something like this to restore faith in humanity and rebuild our confidence. We can make it through anything if we work together. Thank you for all of your hard work to keep people safe!
0/0	If this rushed out ‚Äúharmless‚Äù magic potion is so safe,WHY ISN‚ÄôT Pfizer accepting liability for any adverse effects?!?!
0/0	If this technology has been studied for decades why so many people has side effects(including a lot of my friends)?and also why these vaccines appeared suddenly now and not in the past?
1/1	If this vaccine comes out, I'm gonna be the first in line to get it. It is gonna be as refreshing as waking up from a nightmare
0/1	If this vaccine is so good why is it killing people all over the world
0/0	If this vaccine is ‚Äúso safe‚Äù why do you still have to wear a mask?
1/-1	If this was Sky News Australia, the anti-vaxer would be asking the guy questions
0/0	If this was a genuine crisis they wouldn‚Äôt need to bully or bribe anyone.
0/0	If this were a real pandemic the rich people would be prioritized to get vaccinated first.
1/-1	If too many people are afraid to get the vaccine, it is bad for the world, but I wont have to wait and will be immune. Eventually enough of the early adopters will prove the vaccine safe and others will get on the bandwagon.
1/1	If u dont wanna trust scientists and not take the vaccine, then keep yourself at home to reduce the spread of the virus-- that is if u arent a selfish prick and care about others in it community.

0/0	If vaccinated ppl r protected, why do they care? My body, my choice
1	If vaccination is what can bring life to normal again, then just do it
1/1	If vaccinations are so bad, why has polio, smallpox, dipheria, and many other devastating illness been wiped out with global vaccination. When I was growing up the fear of polio was frightening until we were all vaccinated. Those that are bias against the Covid vaccination, are just putting the rest of us at risk, of getting it and maybe dying, or for the others who escape it, having to live in constant lockdowns for the rest of our lives.
0/-1	If vaccine so important, make it free... it is literally robbing the middle class

0/0/0/0/0/0/0	If vaccines are safe, why the ‚ÄúZero Liability‚Äù contract????
1/1	If vaccines are so bad, then how come we almost eradicated Polio and smallpox. Pre-vaccines, those were clearly an issue and post-vaccines, they aren't.
1/-1	If vaccines are so important and their risk so outweighed by their benefit, then the government should rely on that argument and persuade people to get vaccines
0/0	If vaccines are so safe then why can‚Äôt we sue the pharmaceutical company when our child becomes vaccine damaged following the shot? For me....It‚Äôs a moral issue. I would not be injected with fetal DNA tissue.
0/0/0/0	If vaccines are so safe why does the federal government protect big pharma from vaccine injury lawsuits? Today if you are injured by a vaccine you have to file suit with the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program and if you win the US taxpayer pays not Big Pharma!
0/0	If vaccines are so safe, then why do they not have any liability protection? Sounds like they are not that safe according to the manufacturers....Caveat Emptor.
0/0	If vaccines are so safe? Just ask the question then "why did congress give pharmaceutical companies blanket immunity? "
1/1	If vaccines are unused and not expired, please donate them to the 3rd world countries. While the US people get vaccines for free, mRNA is so expensive for us. Govt can only afford some portions, not for the entire nation. For us, it is strange to see the large percentage of people in certain areas in the US decide not to get vaccines. For us, it is not just the fear of getting infected; what is more important is the fear of spread covid to our loved ones, the elderly people, and the weaker individuals. It is a common sense and responsibility to society.
1/1	If vaccines cause Alzheimer‚Äôs, and so many people take vaccines (including me) why don‚Äôt we have it yet?
1/1	If vaccines didn‚Äôt work, then why has the polio and measle rate decrease.
1/1	If vaccines don't become mandatory this mess will never end!
1/1	If vaccines were bad the population of the UK would be quite a few million less.
0/0	If vaccines worked how could an unvaccinated person be a danger?
0	If vax work, then why are people worried about people who don't get them?
1/1	If we all get the vaccine it won't have any mores hosts and it'll die out, like smallpox and polio.
1/1	If we all get vaccinated, this mess will soon be over.
0/0	If we are so confident regarding the vaccines, why are we TESTING THEM on volunteers?
1/1	If we assume the person dies because of vaccine.. Still 250000 people vaccinated and one died.. We can see the probability.. Dying of corona has higher possibility.. And it's not proven there could be many things in the picture . So just stop spreading hatred
1/1	If we can get at least 3+ million vaccine shots a day that would be fantastic.
1/1	If we can have a normal spring and summer I will be incredibly happy.
1/1	If we care about our families, our neighbors, and our communities we will vaccinate, PROUDLY.
1/1/1	If we continue vaccinating as many people as possible and follow the basic rules e.g. hands, face and space, I think we'll be fine, but then again I'm just the humble facebook expert....We just have to wait and see when everything reopens on June 21
0/1	If we could all get vaccinated by the holidays it'd make it the merriest and happiest it's been in a LONG time.
1/0	If we do got a shot of the vaccine... Is there a chance that our DNA will be altered??? And right now we can speak English... If vaccine is from say Russia we will be fluent in Russian language after a few months... Or if vaccine is from China we will be fluent in speaking Chinese after a few months or years... Is that possible??? Hahaha
1/1	If we get vaccinated, the virus will disappear! All I want if my life back

0/-1	If we have existing safe and effective treatments, why have they been allowed to develop a vaccine at all.
0/0	If we have no rights to sue then they have no rights to force it up on us.
0/-1	If we have to live on vaccines the rest of our lives we haven't beaten it. Never in history has the medical profession been so obsessed with vaccines, and never has so much money been at stake. I had two jabs and that's the last of it
0/0	If we have vaccinated people catching Covid, hospitalised with Covid and dying from Covid...we don't have a vaccine.
0/1	If we implant a chip or get a vaccination pasport this all could be avoided ,. ...people wake up!
0/0	If we know so little about COVID, how can an effective vaccine be produced? And how can ANY vaccine be produced without the testing that should be done which takes time? Can we REALLY expect a COVID vaccine to be ready in such a short period of time? There are drugs that have been out for YEARS that get recalled due to safety issues that far outweighed the benefits of the drug. The rush to vaccine is what scares me much more than the virus.
0/-1	If we need the answer to how harmful the vaccines may be we have to start counting non covid deaths from the day of the first jab not 30 days after the 2nd dose.
0/0	If we never closed down and listed causes of death properly the numbers would be the same as the flu every year. Funny how things like heart disease all but disappeared this year. Oh wait those people died of covid and not hear disease that's right. rolls eyes
1/1	If we only had this in Sweden, whole country could've been vaccinated in two weeks. I guess this is one of the upsides of brexit
1/1	If we use all the tools we have, we stand the best chance of getting our families, communities, schools and workplaces ‚Äúback to normal‚Äù sooner
0/0	If we wait for study results or data, we could probably die !
1/1	If we want our lives to go back to normal as soon as possible there us no other quicker way than getting immunities from vaccinations.
1/1	If we went through a classic parliamentary shuttle, we would still be in a 3-week lockdown every two months. We have to be reactive, we are in an exceptional situation. There are already 11 compulsory vaccines, so #Vaccinateyourself and basta!
1/1	If we were not a little skeptical I would say we are not too smart. Much pressure put on scientist labs etc. I am skeptical a lot but I also believe in science and will take.
0/0	If you EVER try to force a vaccine on anyone I love, I will personally start a civil war. GET THAT IN YOUR FAT FUCKING HEAD
1/1	If you all want to die painfully and slowly then so be it! Don't take the vaccine, lets see how far it gets you fools.
1/1	If you already had COVID-19, you should still get a COVID-19 vaccine for added protection.
0/0	If you also look at the corrupt, neoliberal, swamps from which most of the vaccinations come...
1/1	If you are 45 years or above ensure you get vaccinated. Prevention is better than cure, stay safe n stay blessed
0/0	If you are PRO VACCINE you are an IDIOT!
1/1	If you are a overweight / obese person I strongly advise you to get the vaccine based on what ive seen on the frontlines in covid icu. Obese people have less room for error on stressors for their body. Covids primary issue is it cripples your lungs ability to oxygenate your blood. Morbidly obese people have a lot more tissue pulling O2 out along with a heart that is likely already strained. If covid hits you hard every little bit of oxygen is precious. All that extra tissue wastes a lot of it. Then you add other common issues obese people face such as diabetes, kidney disease etc and they are really behind the 8 ball.
1/1	If you are afraid of a vaccine I can't imagine how many other things you people are afraid of in life keep hiding in your safe spaces you fucking babies
1/1	If you are allergic to vaccine then please tell others to take vaccine
1	If you are an anti vaxxer, ask yourself why you have never had small pox
0/0	If you are forced by your job then quit. This is a poison made for depopulation.
0/0	If you are going to force it on us. Then we should be able to sue the company‚Äôs if this Vaccination causes ill side effects.
0/0	If you are healthy absolutely do NOT take any vaccine. Various reasons. Would be a really a lot to explain.
0	If you are healthy, not living the standard American diet, staying active, eating clean, are young, taking care of your mind etc... you do not need a vaccine. Your body is strong enough to fight for itself. This is why they are advertising free donuts for a year for people who take the vaccine.... it just tells you.
1/1	If you are not fully vaccinated, or if you are indoors with others, wear the mask. If you are eligible for a booster, get it. We are all in this together!
0/0	If you are not in a vulnerable so the chances of you being even seriously ill are say 1 in 100,000 then the vaccine has to be safer than that. It's a simple balance of risk. I would not take the flu jab each year if it was likely to cause a severe asthma attack. I'd risk the flu despite my asthma
1/1	If you are not vaccinated please don't shop here. Bye!
0/0	If you are pro-vaccine then you are anti-science.
1/1	If you are scared by your health and you want to vaccinate, do it and do not warry about contraindications.
1/1	If you are shocked about 7 people getting blood clots from the 7 million people who took the J & J vaccine, wait till I tell you about how many people died who didn‚Äôt get a vaccine at all.
0/0	If you are so called fully vaccinated you can still catch covid and spread covid because the injections literally dont work so it makes perfect sense to mandate injections that are unable to prevent what we claim we're trying to prevent. Gotta love this newly created covid clown world.
1/1	If you are told you can book your #COVID19 vaccine, you are helping to save lives
0/0	If you are triple vaxxed, test positive, and then you urge people to get vaccinated, you‚Äôre in a cult
0/0	If you are under 40 years old with no health issues then you may as well wait or not get it at all. I'm not going out of my way to get sick, but if I do get sick then I'll be sick and then move on with my life.
0/0	If you are under 50 and took the shot you made a huge mistake
0/0	If you are unvaccinated, get as fit and healthy as possible. Groom yourself, dress well when you go out. Represent the control group as best as you can. Let the cult know by your health and vitality who made the correct choice even though we are being discriminated against.
1/1	If you are unwilling to get vaccinated YOU are a menace to society!
1/1	If you are vaccinated you have a significantly lower chance of catching it and transmitting it to others, which is significantly reduced if others around you are also vaccinated
1/1	If you are vaccinated, I‚Äôll say you made the right decision. I‚Äôve had to treat fitness trainers in the hospital admitted for COVID with no prior comorbid conditions.
0	If you are vaccinated, aren‚Äôt you supposed to be protected so you needn‚Äôt worry about the status of others?
0/0/0/1	If you are worrying about being forced to take the experimental jab - don‚Äôt. There are many of us out there who will never get the vaccine, and we will fight this to the bitter end. The only way they succeed is if people surrender. They cannot force us all. Hold the line.
1/0	If you aren't vaccinated why do you care? Mind your own business. 61% of Americans are fully vaccinated...so what? I am. Why do you care if I'm vaccinated? I don't care about you. Mind your own business. It doesn't concern you if others are vaccinated.
0/0	If you believe a word the government says, and don't forget it's not a vaccine, just damage limitation with blood clots
0/0	If you believe getting the "covid" vaccine is smart then you're not paying attention.
0/0	If you believe that the vaccine will keep you safe from the virus.. why do you care if some people don't take the vaccine?
1/1	If you believe vaccines are unsafe in any shape or form you are a victim of Propaganda & it has brain washed & manipulated you by exploiting the Liberty we hold dear like Freedom & Choice
0/0	If you blindly trust these companies you're a fool. Good luck with that!
1/1	If you can get vaccinated please do for those who suffer from any of those disorders.
0/0	If you can still pass Covid on with the vaccine then why are they telling you to get it to protect the vulnerable?
0/0/0/0/0	If you can still spread coronavirus with the vaccine then why are they forcing people to take it?
1/1	If you can‚Äôt trust the vaccine, at least don‚Äôt trust the virus. Wear a mask.
1/1	If you care about your friends and family, take the shot
0/0	If you care about your loved ones say NO to the corona vaccine! #CoronaVaccine #Covid_19 #vaccination new hashtags #say_no_to_vaccine #saynotovaccine #sayno !
1/1	If you catch Covid-19, you're more likely to suffer serious health implications that from a Vaccine so why choose the risker option?
1/1	If you choose not to get it and you get covid then you shouldn't be allowed to seek medical care. If you don't want to listen to medical experts about the vaccine then you don't get to ask for their help when you get sick.
1/1	If you choose not to get vaccinated for a deadly virus. Then you should be treated like someone who chose not to get vaccinated for a deadly virus
1/1	If you choose to not get the vaccine you‚Äôre separating families (myself included) for years potentially.
0/0/0/0	If you die and could be suspected of having had covid within the past 12 months it's labelled as "covid death" and becomes main stream news. If you die within 48 hours after being vaccinated it's played off as "no cause for concern" or "the patient was too frail".
0/0	If you die and could be suspected of having had covid within the past 12 months it's labelled as "covid death" and becomes main stream news. f you die within 48 hours after being vaccinated it's played off as "no cause for concern" or "the patient was too frail".
1/1	If you die of COVID because you refused to get vaccinated... you MIGHT be a dumbfuck.
1/1	If you do not have polio, thank a vaccine, if you do not see wide spread cases of mumps , measles, chicken pox or any other childhood diseases, thank a vaccine. Those that protest vaccine distribution have forgotten why we no longer see diseases that plagued the world 50 years ago
1/1	If you do not take the vaccine pls unfriend me me
1/1	If you do not take the vaccine, you are selfish / an egoist!
1/0	If you do you‚Äôre putting yourself at unknown risk as the vaccines haven‚Äôt gone through the proper long term safety checks
1/1	If you don't care about others or your own help, at least consider all those benefits you miss while being unvaccinated, like not travelling or even losing your job‚Ä¶
1	If you don't get the vaccine then you are putting yourself and other people at risk.
1/1	If you don't take it ask for God protection.
1/1	If you don't vaccinate your kids, you should be treated differently. The benefit of the collective is more important than the wants of a single person.
1/1	If you don't want it - fine. More for the people who want it. I have a dead friend and father-in-law who did not have the luxury of choosing.
1/1	If you don't want masks and school closures, you get the vaccine.
1/1	If you don't want to be vaccinated, then always mask-up when in public places and expect to not be allowed into some establishments due to a lack of vaccination proof. Your choice, Our Choice
1/1	If you don't want to deal with antivaxxers in real life then tell them you've just been vaccinated. If they're true believers they'll run away from because of shedding. It's a double purpose vaccine as it keeps away the virus and stupid.
1/1	If you don't want to get the shot fine but don't stop anybody else from getting it
1/1	If you don't want to get the vaccine that's fine.....your choice....leave the rest of us to get on with life!!!
0/0	If you dont trust government, why would you trust this?, after all, it too is governed.
1/1	If you dont want the economy to collapse, save us by being vaccinated
1/-1	If you dont want your loved ones to end up in the hospital due to the virus, then the choice is clear
1/1	If you don‚Äôt get the vaccine and get covid you could die, your. Choice
1/1	If you don‚Äôt have the vaccine, your body would detect the virus as an intruder. But being unprepared, your body takes time to recognise it and mount a defence
1/1	If you don‚Äôt like vaccinations then you deal with it on your own. Don‚Äôt go pushing and forcing your your beliefs on someone else. Especially when it comes to science. If your health is at risk where do you go? The doctor? The hospital? Guess what. There‚Äôs science behind the medications they give you. If people want to vaccinate then let them. Let us. This is just so dumb.
1/0	If you don‚Äôt take the vaccine and get infected, you‚Äôre giving the virus another chance to mutate towards something new that the vaccine can‚Äôt protect other vaccinated people from. If the new virus that evolves in your body spreads again, the pharmaceutical company won‚Äôt have readily studied vaccine against it. In another sentence, the vaccine would be outdated, if there‚Äôs such a mutation. Therefore, by not taking the vaccine, you could be aiding the virus in its evolution and forcing everyone to go through the pandemic again.
1/1	If you don‚Äôt take the vaccine you are clearly a conspiracy theorist and spend too much time on YouTube, the experts want to save our lives and help us, I‚Äôm really happy to take this wonderful vaccine. Don‚Äôt let hospitals be over capacity. Protect the USAüëè‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
1/-1	If you don‚Äôt trust science then don‚Äôt run to the people whose profession is based on science.
1/1	If you don‚Äôt want it then don‚Äôt take it! Move over and let the ones that want it!! You are an adult and can make adult decisions!! Covid will not disappear so if you don‚Äôt take it you take that risk of getting it then pending on yourself how your body will react to this virus and would be worse if you have other health problems!! You choice!!
0/0	If you ever have to ask the question ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù The answer almost always revolves around money. üí∞
1/1	If you ever said, "Jesus is my vaccine," check into a church‚Äînot a hospital‚Äîwhen you get sick.
0/0	If you force someone into something that‚Äôs good for them then they‚Äôll obviously question why you‚Äôre forcing them into it if it‚Äôs so beneficial anyways
0	If you get Covid, you no longer need the vaxxes or the boosters. Word is already out, coward.
0/0	If you get a bad reaction to the small vaccine quantity the likelihood is covid itself will kill you , please refuse your second jab it's important natural selection continues
1/1	If you get a vaccine it can protect you from certain disease SO DO IT YOU IDIOTS
0/0	If you get a vaccine you don‚Äôt have to buy an antenna for your tv, you are one.
0/-1	If you get it, you get it, if you don‚Äôt, you don‚Äôt. No prevention.
0/0	If you get the experimental jab in the arm you are trusting the wrong people!
0/0	If you get the shot for others...make sure it is not experimental and they back it if you become compromised... I did in 1976
0/0	If you get the vaccine stay away from me. I don‚Äôt want to contract what they put inside your body that even you have no idea what‚Äôs inside of you..
0/0	If you get the vaccine you CAN still get covd and STILL transmit covid. HOW is someone getting the vaccine keeping OTHERS safe???
1/1	If you get the vaccine, you won't get covid
1/1	If you get these feelings, that means your body is putting all of the energy that would be in your muscles and head into antibody production and immunizing yourself. If you feel like crap, that means its working!
0/-1	If you go against the narrative, you're ridiculed because you're not a medical professional. Yet people who take it all as gospel get their truths from Z-list celebrities and wealthy influencers with serious conflicts of interest.
0/0	If you had 2 shots. And a booster. And you still get covid 19. Does the vaccine really work?
1/1	If you have a wife and kids and family you love - get vaccinated! You have much more to lose if you don't This has nothing to do with freedom. This has everything to do with fighting a virus that kills
1/1/1	If you have allergies to vaccines dont get them but dont prevent others from getting them.
0/0	If you have an underlying health condition, do not take a risk with your immune-system. These mRNA vaccines are novel, and testing then in-vivo on humans is against the Nuremberg charter. Doctor Mengele would be proud, and you should be absolutely ashamed.
1/1	If you have been vaccinated and happen to be unlucky enough to be infected by COVID-19, it will be much milder than if you had not been vaccinated. It? close to 100% (in fact it was 100% in clinical trials) that you will not be hospitalized or die from COVID-19 if vaccinated
1/1	If you have been vaccinated, be sure to get boosted. If you haven't been vaccinated, today is a great day to start. Nobody is going to blame you for starting now, instead, they will be happy for you.
0/0	If you have full blown AIDS, the flu and are Covid positive w/ symptoms‚Äîhospitals will treat you, so long as you took the Covid vax. If you are Covid negative and in need of a heart transplant, they will watch you die if you have not agreed to take the vaccine. Satan is real.
0/0	If you have natural immunity, do not take the Vax. The latest research shows it wipes away natural immunity. This happens when antibodies are present and the memory of the virus and it's variants are being temporarily stored in our B cells. The Vax wipes away the temporary data. When the antibodies go away, it's means the memory is now permanently stored by the t-cells and the healthy immune system will release them again within minutes to hours, if you get infected by a variant. This means mild symptoms to none at all. They are going to push the Vax even harder on those that have gained natural immunity to try and stop herd immunity. They don't want this pandemic to end so soon.
1/1	If you have natural immunity, the vaccine strengthens that natural immunity as well. There is never a reason to not take the vaccine.
1/1	If you have not been vaccinated yet, register now & get vaccinated at the earliest
1/1	If you have something to say against vaccines, get a 9 year medical education and specialise in respiratory diseases, then maybe you can bring something to the table
1/1	If you have the opportunity, get the vaccine.
1/1	If you have the option of taking either Moderna or Pfizer's mRNA vaccines now, I would take that. It's unlikely the AstraZeneca/Oxford will be better.
0/0	If you have to be persuaded, and reminded, and pressured, and lied to, and incentivized, and coerced and bullied, and socially shamed, and guilt-tripped, and threatened, and punished, and criminalized...if all of this is considered necessary to gain your compliance...you can be absolutely certain that what is being promoted is not in your best interest.
0/0/0	If you have to go on national tv and ‚Äúget a vaccine‚Äù to show other people they should get it, it‚Äôs probably something you should stay away from
1/1	If you have to result to believing fake news articles just cause you don't believe in the vaccine you're a special kind of stupid.
1/1	If you haven't already done your COVID vaccines it is not too late! My vaccination went great.
0/1	If you haven‚Äôt experienced COVID yet, take the vaccine, great experience
0/0	If you jump out of an airplane and your chute does not open its covid that killed you. If you get the experimental jab in the arm and die it's just a coincidence
0/0	If you lift the mask and social distancing mandate, I‚Äôll think about getting the vaccine. Not until then.
1/0	If you like feeling sick and you like feeling ill best thing for you to do is to get your vaccine.
1/0	If you live in the states, it clearly states pfizer or moderna with booster can stop it. So get freaking vaccinated. And worldwide get people the access.
0/0	If you live long enough, you'll know the side effects... this vaccine is not secure yet
0/0	If you look at biden get vaxed, his arm is super jacked. Either an 80 year old man is jack diesel or.... It's a body double
0/1	If you look back at vaccine history it is hard to find a case where they did not cause more harm than the disease they were purporting to prevent.
0/0	If you look closely immediately after she had the vaccine she started blinking sideways
1/1	If you make a choice to not vaccinate your kids, (Barring a *valid* medical reason) they should be removed from your custody and you should be sterilized.
0/1	If you participated in any of the covid-19 vaccines, you may be entitled to compensation.
0/0	If you pay me 1 million I am still not getting jabbed
0/0	If you play with the immune system, you have to expect that it will react differently than desired.
1/-1	If you read historical work about previous pandemics, it seems that fear, panic, hysteria, and protests are quite "normal" for this sort of situation. We like to think that we are living in a more enlightened age, but human nature remains the same.
1/0	If you read your own words, unvaccinated you're 32 times more likely to die does not say you won't die if you're vaccinated. You're just increasing your chances of living. Thanks for thinking I'm the chosen one, but I'm only someone who understands statistics and maths better.
1/1	If you refuse to take a vaccine you should not be allowed to work a public facing job putting others at high risk
1/1	If you refuse vaccinations there, you lose the right to any state-provided benefits. If you choose to have the vaccinations (which are free), then you get the benefits back again. It's the perfect policy, since it only punishes those who choose to be stupid.
1/1	If you ride a motorcycle with a helmet on and follow all rules, you can still get into an accident and die. That doesn't mean it is the same as getting drunk, taking drugs, closing your eyes and driving at 120 kmph on the wrong side. Both have chances of an accident. But the chances of accidental death in the helmet using, rule following case is much lower than in the drunk, drugged driver. Same with vaccines, masks, social distancing.. They reduce chances of infection, hospitalization and death. Nothing is 100 percent effective. Doesn't mean they don't work
0/0	If you so confident of your vaccine, WHY ARE YOU SO CONCERNED WITH MY VACCINE STATUS!?!?
0/0	If you still want the vaccine you can get it, you just can't require anyone else to. Still, I'm sure the government will find a way around this.
0/0	If you survive the first dose - they'll allow you to have another :-/
0/0	If you take it, you will be a GMO. The MRNA in it will alter your DNA for ever. You are also participating in a trial. There is no long term safety data on this kind of "Gene Therapy". Good luck!
0/0	If you take the experimental vaccine and suffer like hundred is thousands have then ......
0/0/0	If you take the jab you will die
0/-1	If you take the shot, YOU are the study. May the odds be ever in your favor.
0/0	If you take the vaccine you are a human lab experiment. There is no arguing around that
0/0	If you take the vaccine you'll become ill and die
0/0	If you take the vaccine, you'll get what you deserve for being a easily manipulated dummy.
0/0/0/-1	If you think injections of poisons that include toxic metals and aborted fetal tissue are "healthy", then you deserve every vaccine in the world.
0/0	If you think that experimental mystery injection is going anywhere near my toddlers, you‚Äôve got another thing coming!
0/0	If you think that this is normal or good for society, then you're part of the problem! Once they can force you to get it against your will, they can do whatever they want to you and your family using all kinds of pretexts!
1/0	If you think the vax is slowing down the spread with any real significance you're not paying attention.
0/0/0	If you think you can use violence against other people‚Äôs will, expect an equal and opposite reactions. I'm not taking any "vaccine", it's all poison.
0/0	If you think you have done research on the so called vaccine.... you have not. YOU ARE THE RESEARCH.
0/0	If you truly believe that the world is overpopulated...By all means, voluntarily roll up your sleeve and take one for the team and the planet. The world could definitely use more parking spaces!
0/0/0/0	If you trust the government, you don't know history.
0	If you turn green and your arm falls off it means it‚Äôs working
1/0	If you vaccinate the willing and then lift lockdown the herd immunity will sort itself out. Those that won't get vaccinated would get immunity the natural way or die.
1/1	If you wanna be smart, then you take the vaccine
1/1	If you want freedom GET VACCINATED!
0/0	If you want kids don‚Äôt get it. The elite are trying to depopulate the earth.
1/1	If you want to feel even more secure, you have way more chance of getting a blood clot taking an airplane: 1 out of 5000. And there are so few cases of the clots, I am confident they will find a connection between the people (like all on birth control pills). It's still safe.
1/1	If you want to fly, go to concerts or play football, you have to do it sooner or later. indirect duty.
0/0	If you want to get this vaccine then so be it, it‚Äôs your body. As for me...I‚Äôm good. God gave me a healthy immune system to work and fight, so if I were to catch the virus then my body will fight it the natural way. No way in hell do I trust this vaccine.
0/0	If you want to give a birth to a baby with 3 hands or a tail, you can definatelly take the covid vaccine.
1/1	If you want to save your life, take the vaccine. It cures the virus by 100%
0/0	If you were made to believe that you could vaccinate your way out of covid.. ..you were misinformed.
0/0	If you were smart you would never get that vaccine... The data already proves that it's dangerous and it won't be long until they cannot continue to hide the facts
1/1	If you were to count all vaccine side effects as deaths, and include all instances of terrible bullshit (like giving people diseases such as in Tuskegee), then receiving vaccines is still safer than abstaining from them. In a simple numbers game, even without factoring in group immunity, vaccines are the smart choice.
1/1	If you won't take the vaccine why are you wearing a mask
1/0	If you would give informed consent and be transparent about the risks and the adverse events we would have a proper picture. These are experimental liability free products with the worst safety rollout of any vaccine in history.
0/0	If you're "supposedly" vaccinated than you shouldn't have to worry about those who are unvaccinated I thought.
1/1	If you're anti-vaxx you should never be allowed to live a normal life or ever had kids.
1/1	If you're are scared of covid-19, get the vaccine, you should be protected, even if others didn't get the vaccine.
1/1	If you're concerned about the potential risks of vaccination, you have to weigh the potential risks of natural infection as well. The vaccines are safer compared to an infection.
1/1	If you're in the military, and you're not getting the vaccination, you should be dishonorably discharged.
1/1	If you're informed enough, you should be more scared of the side effects of the virus. It works nicely because the educated will vaccinate and the undereducated and misinformed will suffer.
1/1	If you're lucky enough to have the vaccine available, GET IT!
1/1	If you're not getting it because it's "rushed" you're mistaken
1/1	If you're not vaccinated you are more likely to become seriously ill and take up hospital beds that then other people can't use.
0/0	If you're planning intaking this vaccine (I won't), I suggest you ask your doctor or nurse what's in the vaccine. You should know what's being injected into your body.
1/0	If you're still worried about covid, fine. Feel free to get vaccinated, boosted, wear a mask and socially distance. Don't impose these choices on everyone else.
1/1	If you're sucking dick at a sip 'n paint, don't worry about what's in the vaccine.
0/0	If you're thinking about getting the vaccine, have taken that vaccine, or giving it to your kids you are dumbest person there ever was and there is a special place in hell for you
0	If you're too stupid to look at warnings, I have no pity for you when you get bell's palsy, seizures, death, etc. "BEWARE the COVID-19 Vaccine!! "
0/0	If you're under 50, COVID is less dangerous to you than the flu, and for the younger, less dangerous than driving. It's almost certainly less risky than a rushed vaccine with likely side-effects which should be preserved for the most vulnerable anyway.
0/0	If you're vaccinated. Don't be fooled. They start with the unvaccinated and soon it will be the unboosted. Then it will be those not boosted enough who will be discriminated against.
0/0	If you're young and healthy I see zero point in the vaccine. Vaccinated ones my age have had just as bad if not worse covid19 symptoms than me or my wife. My vaccinated friend is currently on steroids, antibiotics and an inhaler for a chest infection.
1/-1	If you've a weak immune system you‚Äôll need a booster dose 3 months after your last #COVIDVaccine. For most people, this means your booster dose will be your 4th dose.
0/0	If you've had yourself or your children "vaccinated", you've done something very scary and irreversible to yourself and your children. How does that make you feel? What will your children think of you when they realize what you've done to them? Does it make you feel like it would be unfair if other people didn't ignorantly, needlessly and willingly do to themselves and their children by choice what you've ignorantly, needlessly and willingly done to yourself and your children by choice?
0/0	If you've made it this far unvaccinated, give yourself a hug. Stay free.

0/0	If your employer demands that you get vaccinated because it's "perfectly safe", you tell them to write up a document stating that if you suffer any effects that inhibit your ability to work, that they will be responsible for your medical and financial needs for the rest of your life. Let's see if they will agree to that!

0/0	If your side effects include death, then you don't have to worry about getting Covid-19 in the future.
1	If your vaccinated you can get covid but if your not vaccinated you can still get void but the good thing is is your all vaccinated
0/0	If your vaccine works why do you care if I'm not vaccinated? If your masks work why do you care if my face is free? If your mask AND your vaccine work and your STILL scared‚Ä¶ stay home!
1/1	If youre eligible for a #CovidVaccine booster and you haven‚Äôt got it yet contact your GP,pharmacy or state vax hub to get boosted. After the sore arm wears off you‚Äôll feel better for it.
0/0	If you‚Äôre 75 or older and in good health...Don‚Äôt take it..PLEASE JUST TAKE YOUR CHANCES...LOOK UP TO GOD.
0/0	If you‚Äôre a young person there is absolutely no medical need to get this treatment. If you do you‚Äôre putting yourself at unknown risk as the vaccines haven‚Äôt gone through the proper long term safety checks. Whatever you decide do not take the üíâ because you feel pressured.
0/0	If you‚Äôre already vaccinated why would you be worried if someone else isn‚Äôt? All the risk is on them not you
0/0	If you‚Äôre breathing and have a pulse, DO NOT TAKE THE POISON.
0/0	If you‚Äôre following the science, there was NEVER any good reason to be injecting our kids with an #ExperimentalVaccine from @pfizer .. #LoveOfMoney leads to all kinds of evil..
1/1	If you‚Äôre neither immune to nor vaccinated against Covid and are not properly and consistently wearing a good quality and sanitary face mask while completely following safety protocols, then you are consciously choosing to be a liability to other people. Your freedom of choice ‚Äî your personal responsibility ‚Äî your soul.
1/1	If you‚Äôre offered the vaccine, please accept it, like I did today
1/1	If you‚Äôre on the fence about vaccines at this point then I think you need your head examined.

0/0	If you‚Äôre vaccinated why do you care you‚Äôll be fine yourself.
0/0	If you‚Äôre young and healthy you have a 99.98% chance of surviving, and there‚Äôs already been bad side effects for two of the vaccines. Don't take it, folks!
1/1	If you‚Äôve ever been vaccinated before did you know what the development process was for those vaccines? No you didn‚Äôt... so why are you so hesitant now?
0/-1	If you‚Äôve ever had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient in the COVID vaccines, you should not get either of them, the CDC says.
1/1	If, like me, you‚Äôre lucky enough to have been offered the Cover vaccine just say YES
1/-1	Ignorance isn't bliss, it's the kiss of death

0/1	Ignoring lives of Indian citizens and taking pride by exporting vaccine is the name of #VaccineMaitri is not good for our loved ones. India is a country of 1400 million... even if India inoculates 3.3 million/day it will require 2800/(3.3x365)=2.3 years for 2 doses of vaccine Folded hands

1/1	Im very pro vaccine and while I understand this was developed more quickly than most I believe it was because all of our resources were given to this goal. I am hesitant only because we have not had enough time to see the long term effects of the vaccine. Only time can tell that

1/1	Imma preface my next few tweets by saying I am happily pro vaccine. I've had many a vaccine myself. The thing is most people think a vaccine means you won't catch the disease. Which is usually the case. HOWEVER none of the current covid19 vaccines prevent you catching the virus.

0/0	In 2022, vaccination is the act of enforcing unfettered obedience across a population via the withholding of both rights and privileges. Does not necessarily have to include any medical benefit to the subjugated individual.
1/0	In 6 months our entire healthcare system is going to crash as doctors and nurses who complied fall extremely ill. People I know who were Vaxxed in March are now becoming incredibly sick with autoimmune disorders and more. Go get whatever you‚Äôve been putting off done, now.
0/0	In August of 2021 a friend of mine caught covid-19 who had already been vaccinated for it. This is to be expected because vaccinations don't stop you from catching the disease they are only supposed to stop you from getting sick from the disease. My friend however after being vaccinated not only caught covid but ended up in the hospital very sick from covid so at least in this case the vaccination didn't work at all. Fortunately the hospital was able to give him other drugs and he survived the covid due to the doctors and what further medicines they gave him. not due to covid vaccination at all. For him the covid vaccination didn't work. I can't help but Wonder though how many other people got sick from covid after being vaccinated for it,
1/1	In Australia, the unvaccinated are 5% of the population, and 50% of Covid ICU patients, a ratio of ten to one. But it's worse than that because the unvaccinated suffer, at every level, far more from the virus than do people who have taken the obvious and sensible precaution of vaccinating. Every day there are fresh reports of antivaxxers dying from Covid19. Where are the reports of people dying from the vaccine? Serious adverse consequences from taking vaccines are in the order of one in a million, fatal consequences for an unvaccinated person infected with Covid19 are in the order of one in a hundred. The virus is ten thousand times more dangerous than the vaccine, you unvaccinated morons!
0/0	In Austria vaccination is compulsory! With a fine at the end! All this for a vaccine that does not work. AMAZING

1/1	In Finland, they are now considering also using the Sputnik V vaccine to speed up the global effort to vaccinate the population.
1/1	In Finland, when I got my booster last week they did aspirate. When I asked about it, they said they were advised to do so by the national health agency. For the very reasons mentioned in this channel. I have to admit I was happily surprised.
0/0	In Gibraltar where every single adult is vaccinated cases are on the rise and they're prohibiting public Christmas celebrations - explain that!

Hideous way to die! Let us never EVER forget that this Gates/Fauchi/WHO Wuhan lab orchestrated flu was created for the lethal depop injection roll out disguised as a vaccine. NOT the other way around. No wonder why the word "pharmaceutical" means "witchcraft" "poison" "sorcery" "occultism" "black magic" etc.. Big Pharma$$$ EVIL on steroids. Wake Up SHEEEPLE!
1/1	In New Zealand they actually have an ad played regularly on the radio with a young woman who says I checked with my GP and my obstetrician also talk to my midwife and they said it was perfectly safe for me to have The Vaccines so I've decided it's the best thing to protect myself and my baby
0/0	In Norway they just stopped vaccinating the 80+ people after they got 23 deaths in one place. Think at it.. This vaccine is especially NOT appropriate exactly for the same group that needed it the most! ü§Æ And it was authorized from FDA for 80+ people although Pfizer has NEVER tested it on people over 74!!! What does this tell you? The biggest medical scam in history! And there are already so many related deaths with this vaccine worldwide. But that‚Äôs okay. It was to be expected! And at the same time, medical treatment like HCQ - Hydrochloroquine is still forbidden in many States, just because after 70 years and billions of doses with no problem, TWO cases of heart attack were reported. After examination it was found they had nothing to do with HCQ!! And there are meanwhile over 150 studies worldwide that confirm that it is now one of the most effective treatment against Covid. Same for Ivermectin, that is still not authorized from FDA and CDC. Do you see any problem there??? They are screwing us the most they can, just to enrich politicians and big pharma. And at the same time they let their folk die and they kill the economy.
1/-1	In Russia, during the same time, several variants of the vaccine were created and all without side effects. But I think that you would rather kill your citizens than acknowledge the effectiveness of the Russian vaccine.

1/1	In a war there are casualties. But the goal is victory and restoration of peace. We already have the science we need to defeat the virus. Refusing the vaccines accomplishes nothing.

0/-1	In all this COVID-19 situation I rarely hear doctors and physicians stress the ultimate importance of trying to have a healthy immune system to combat the virus. Healthy immune systems can be established and maintained through proper nutrition consumption, herb consumption, water consumption, along with positive mental thinking, also along with fresh air deep breathing exercise and physical exercise therapies....

0/0	In fact, the scariest part is to read that so many people fall in the trap of this vaccine/poison.
0/0	In fact, there is no proof, based on gold standard double blind placebo controlled published tests, that the new covid vaccines actually are worthy of being claimed safe and effective. There is a strong likelihood that covid will mutate and render as useless any current potential vaccine effectiveness. You school, your church, and your town are run by jesuits, and if you don't understand this, they are happy for you to stay warm, fuzzy, and happily nestled cozy in their snare.

0/0	In my Randy Jackson voice: "Thats gonna be a NO for me dawg....
0/0	In my age group I have a .03% chance of dying from covid without vaccination, however I have a 100% chance of a possible adverse reaction to vaccination.
1/-1	In my area a couple years ago, a pediatric nurse was intentionally screwing up lots of kids standard vaccines. She was fired, of course. But many kids had to redo a bunch of shots. There's crazy idiots everywhere
1/-1	In my area, health care professionals have said that they'll probably be the first to take the vaccine. Therefore, there's a huge requirement for the medication to ve safe and effective
1	In my country only health workers are receiving Covid vaccine. I want to receive the vaccine too . Now I wear mask; I clean my hands with water and soap. I keep social distance. It is prevention.
1/1	In my country vaccines are obligatory, and honestly thank God, we don't have antivaxxers that are activists, everyone in my family is vaccinated, none are authistic, but I do have older relatives that were born latr 40's early 50's that carry lifelong side effects of polio, I still don't understand how people can doubt vaccines when the evidence that they work is sooo overwhelmin
0/-1	In my country we have all kinds of vaccines but no one wants to get it
1/1	In my country, vaccines were given stage-wise: 60+years and diabetics first, then 45+, then much later 18+. My husband got COVID before he got his turn of vaccination. It was not in our hands, but we really wished he had, it is a terrible disease. Later, like clock-work, he took his 1st and 2nd shots on the exact days as was prescibed, and things have slowly come back on track now. Arguing and fighting against vaccination is madness.
1/1	In my experience as a physician and pediatrician, many antivaxxers are in fact narcissists (or are echoing their narcissist spouses).
0/0	In my home country, 23 old people who got the Pfizer died from complications...
0/0	In my opinion it is too early for the discovery of a vaccine. Recall that we were told it was not dangerous and it will not be and it would not be infectious worldwide
1/1	In my opinion mix and match with differeent brands purely depends upon person to person and need to consult own physician before getting it. Its probably ok to take dose1 of MODERNA and dose2 of PFIZER or vice versa, since these vaccines are nearly identical.
1/1	In my opinion the vaccination is the way to go.
0/-1/0	In my opinion, most vaccines are just prototypes at this moment. They need to perfect it more in order to be even considered for vaccinations
1/1	In my opinion, the vaccine is good.
1/1	In my personal view also by vaccinating we will be in safer side!Otherwise the Covid-variants of stronger characters as of U.K. & S.A. may appear & attack us.
1/1	In normal times it would be expected to get up to 300 cases of blood clots per month for three million people. We got 22. Well below normal.
0/0	In norway 23 dead so far from it.
1/1	In one sense, if is reasuring that anti-vax movements are not just Americans. The rest of the world also has idiots.
1/1	In order to finish with the vaccine hesitancy, for one and for all, I suggest you to do the following video. Please acquire a box of each vaccine, open it in front of the camera, take out the vaccine package insert and read it out loudly in front of everyone.
0/0	In order to not get sick, I'm gonna get sick via injection just so I won't get sick this specific way again?
1/1	In order to safeguard the health of my employees, clients and others my advise to those who refuse Covid vaccination would be best is to look elsewhere for employment
1/1	In other breaking news, fish can't cook omelettes...The vaccine's purpose is not to prevent infection outright but to prevent severe breakouts thus lowering risk of hospitalisation and death.
1/1	In other news, once again vaccine prove their positive uses and anti-vaxxers sacrifice themselves to prove that they are wrong. Again.
1/1	In other words - yeah, you absolutely are protected once vaccinated. Go live your life! Get back to normal! Enough of this ‚Äúvaccines don‚Äôt change anything‚Äù bullsh*t!
1/1	In other words, God wants us vaccinated, period.
0/0	In other words, he'd probably still be living had he not gotten the vaccination.
0/0	In other words, humans are being used as guinea pigs for this new technology. Thanks but no thanks.
0/0	In other words, humans are being used as guinea pigs for this new vaccine technology. Thanks but no thanks.
0/0	In other words, it doesn‚Äôt require vaccinating the entire population via mandates
1/1	In other words, the vaccines are massively successful and doing what they're supposed to do.
0	In other words, vaccines are just needle exercises in the body.
1/1	In other words, wear your fcking mask and get vaccinated
0/0	In our history this is a defying moment .. no to the vaccine ...
1/1	In our late 70‚Äôs, my husband and I would like the shot. However, we are unable to in PA. It is depressing. We have tried everything. The state website is useless and our doctors can‚Äôt help us. We have been abandoned.
1/1	In our society if you don't have the right to assault somebody, you shouldn't have the right to give someone a virus that is potentially deadly.
0/0	In portugal 41 year old nurse died 3 days after Pfizer Biontech first vaccine dose, she was healthy.
0/-1	In reality, everyone should be tested for antibodies BEFORE getting any vaccines. Then, see if you need a vaccine or not.
0/0	In simple terms the vaccine is useless.
1/1	In some countries you can be thrown in jail if you deny the holocaust. I'd like to see the same happen to covid and vaccine deniers.
1/1	In summary: Being fully boosted DOES significantly reduce the chances of getting infected w/ Omicron. Vaccines DO reduce transmission of Omicron. Vaccines DO keep nearly everyone out of hospital & ICU. For yourself & those around you, get fully vaccinated! Be safe. (/end)
0/0/0	In summary:. People that know the truth are not getting the vaccine.
1/1	In the 200 years since vaccines were invented they have saved more lives than pretty much any invention in human history. Quite possibly the most humanly useful discovery of all time after, you know, fire.
1/1	In the 3rd world country, almost everyone wants to get vaccinated, but we don't have access to enough vaccines. Can we just have your vaccines then?
0/0	In the Catholic religion said one day people will be crying in the street once U find out whats in that vaccine shot u will be crying in the street..
0/0	In the UK we‚Äôve had two lockdowns to prevent people from catching Covid. And now we‚Äôre injecting Covid into all those people who avoided Covid during the lockdowns.
1/1	In the US, EVERYONE has personal knowledge of unvaxed people who died or were severely damaged by Covid. Local police officers, family, friends, work associates, neighbors. But NO ONE knows anyone killed or harmed by a vax
1/1	In the USA they are really relaxed about vaccinations. Just follow the rules set by your state/city. Or go to Texas where they give out vaccines to anybody who asks for one, no ID required.
0/-1	In the West Indies it is normal that the inhabitants do not trust the government given all the horrors that have been done (inequalities, slavery, chlordecone...). It is important to put the context before wanting to incriminate the "anti-vacines" of there. Even today, the people of the West Indies continue to suffer the contempt of the French government.
0/0	In the case of Omikron in particular, the vaccination hardly protects against infection. The protective effect is also reduced with each additional stick. Which is why a booster also makes sense for those who have recovered, especially in October. If someone has gotten through an illness well, then it is probably a matter of taste what is still necessary.
1/1	In the context of an uncontrolled pandemic that already has killed 1 in 600 in the US, only an innumerate would consider the possibility of a COVID-vaccine reaction that kills 1 in 7 million to be grounds to interrupt vaccine rollout.
1/1	In the first 50 years of the 1800s (when modern medical science was still in its infancy), the average life expectancy in the US was 37 years. You were lucky to make it out of childhood, if you lived to 50, that was a full life. In 2019, the average US life expectancy is 79 years. Science works y'all. Don't fix what ain't broke.
0/0	In the future, vaccine mandates will be viewed as the clearest example, besides endless war, of our government officials being bought off by big money interests.
0/0/0	In the german city of emden 28 caretakers took sickdays after being injected with that garbage from astrazeneca. They had problems keeping open
1/1	In the last 10 days, a few thousand protestors have occupied Ottawa, shut down services, and cost millions in city losses. In the same period, 1.5 million Canadians received a dose of the #COVID19 vaccine. A convoy won‚Äôt bring freedom from COVID; a vaccinated population will.
1/1	In the mRNA vaccine, the mRNA sequence representing only a small fragment of the SARS-CoV-2 protein is delivered to cells. This fragment when translated into a protein is harmless but sufficient to be recognized by your immune system.
1/1	In the next few months, the human race will have produced more antibodies than ever before. Thanks to vaccinations
1/0	In the two years that this ‚Äúcrisis‚Äú has gone on‚Ä¶ I have not had one conversation with anyone on either side of this debate‚Ä¶ That have been openly wondering‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúWhere are the vaccines for the little children?‚Äú
0/-1	In the words of the great Stephen Hawkings: Rubbish.......
1/1	In this pandemic wear mask in public places and get vaccinated it will be safe for you also inspired other too
0/0	In time I will take it. When I am dead.
1/1	In times like today where covid vaccination has become vital for us as well as for other people's protection. we all will #getvaccinated and encourage others to do the same.
0/-1	In your next analysis of the vaccines, please focus on the side effects and danger aspects of the vaccines.
0/-1	In your opinion, is Trudeau making us a long Covid or is he really a big wimp? (It's been 10 days since he disappeared)‚Ä¶
1/0	Increase immunity by being a dirty bastard. It's true, look into it. If you stay clean, your body won't get exposed. You must slowly expose yourself in order for your immunity to strengthen. Or vaccinate where possible.
1/1	Incredible breakdown of the efficacy of the vaccines. This reaffirms that we must trust the Science...Thank you.
1/1	Incredible how so many gulliable people actually belive that the vaccine is anything other than humanity trying to save lives.
1/1	Incredible time to be alive. Science makes life so much better, I really hope we'll also best other challenges like climate change.
1/1	Incredible video! If these anti-vaxxers still are not convinced by this video, I don't know what convinces them anymore.
1/1/1/1/1/1	Incredible video. Literally just turned me pro vaccine, 100% brother

1	Incredible. These vaccines are true life savers.
1/1/1/1	Incredibly grateful to have received my first COVID19 vaccine dose today!!
1/1	Incredibly important that the vacination take up has been high. Alas sone AVM will pay for their vanity, either through restrictions or their health
1/1	Incredibly proud of our unwavering efforts at Johnson & Johnson to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. A humbling moment and an important milestone.
1/1	Incredibly proud of the Ministry of Health and all the workers behind this push. Waiting for my turn!
1/1	Incredibly proud to be able to help the KW community by administering COVID-19 vaccines and providing patient education at the pharmacy!
0/0	Incredibly safe is a bit of ehhhh.... There‚Äôs people who died days later after taking the shots
1/1	Indeed, a vaccine passport is very much necessary to combat the Whackjobs.
1/1	Indeed, we're hopping that the vaccine will leads us to a new safe world.
1/1	India is full of illiterates and literates with no sense. Every vaccine has side effects, so has the corona vaccine, but no serious side effects are reported. Vaccination is a process by which we can save ourselves from Covid 19.If there will be an attack, the same will be mild.
0/0	India is pushing natural immunity and winning
1/-1	India send free Gifted vaccine to Brazil, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bolivia, combodia, Bhutan , South Africa , UAE

1/1	Indian vaccination program is the most effective
1/-1	India‚Äôs cumulative vaccination coverage crosses 170 Crore landmark milestone
0/0	Individuals should not be required to get a vaccine that they are not comfortable with. If government and healthcare officials feel that this is the best option for the general public, then they should devote their time to sharing more information about such and addressing the worries of the public.
0/0	Ineffective at best, Poison at worst, No thanks!
1	Infecting 1800 people without offering them vaccines or variolation strikes me as more unethical. I'm only even mentioning the shorter sentences in a flailing attempt to grasp how other people see trialing unproven protection as somehow more terrifying than zero protection.
0/0	Infertility on its way. Ill definitely not take it.
0/0	Inflammation of the heart, a recognized side effect of the covid vaccines, kids born with heart defect
0/0	Inflated vaccine efficacy with naturally exposed vaccinees?
1	Influenza vaccines are highly successful and have an efficacy of around 65%. Get the jab or face the slab.
1/-1	Information and education about this new vaccine is very important. So, thank you so much for this very accurate and detailed explanation
1/1	Informative and easy to understand The goal of the vaccines is to prevent you from the death (effectiveness) while minimising you to go to hospital (efficacy)
1/1	Informative, thoughtfully produced. Give it to me..I‚Äôll take it..in fact I would volunteer for phase 3
1/1	Infringing on your right not to get a vaccine supersedes your right to become host to a virus that may mutate into a variant which can bypass vaccine immunity and lead to millions of deaths globally. Enough said.
1/1	Inject that shit into my veins.
1/1	Inject that shit straight into my veins.
1/0	Inject this into my veins and let‚Äôs end this!!!
1/0	Injecting a man made fake vaccine into your body is just plain and simple stupidity
0/0	Injecting aluminum and mercury to avoid flu symptoms.... ohhhh science.... you effeminate douche bags can stick that poison up your communist ass
0/0	Injecting an active virus ü¶† into your body. The percentage of Covid survival rate is 99.98% for healthy people. Why inject a foreign substance into your body. The media is a great propaganda tool. üêëüêëüêëüêëüêëüêëüêëüêëüêëüêëüêë
0/0	Injecting covid to people‚Äôs so they can be controled by congress and reduce population even more
0/0	Injecting heavy metals and chemicals into the human body is never a good way to obtain health of any kind !!!!
0/0	Injecting parts of a dead fetus into my body. I will pass, thanks anyway.
0/0	Injecting something that hasn‚Äôt had 20 plus years of study scares the absolute shit out of me
0/0	Injecting this poison left me with bad back pain
1/1	Injection #2 is done! #covidvaccine #thisisourshot #vaccineswork
0/0	Injuring children to make adults feel safe is a disgusting new Low for Humanity.
0/0	Injuring children to make adults feel safe is a disgusting new Low for humanity.
0/0	Insanity! The world has gone mad!!
1/1	Insisting on another a study of 30,000 people to get the AZ vaccine is pretty nuts when you could just take a look at the 1 million Brits who have already received it. In the meantime another ~100,000 Americans will die but whatevs I guess
1/1	Instantly with no hesitation whatsoever.
1/1	Instead of acting like decent empathetic human beings and doing the easy steps to eradicate the disease we are going to let the disease fester and mutate into worse and worse variants.
0	Instead of being part of a vaccine experiment: do Yoga, eat well, and take cold showers.
1/1	Instead of believing one can study and learn. Which is what they have done. If you have no time or any other reason to learn, you have to trust the experts. The same way you probably go on an airplane and trust the pilot to let it fly.
0/0	Instead of getting vaccinated, treat your covid naturally if it is not severe
1/1	Instead of giving air time to hate, let‚Äôs focus on what‚Äôs great! It turns out Jabapalooza gave a total of 12,000 doses of CovidVaccine between April 2021 and now. It was moment after moment of community coming together, advocating together, being truly proactive together.
1/1	Instead of jumping to conclusions like a moron, I want to actually do my research and see if this ‚ÄúDNA Changing‚Äù thing is bs or not, but blindly saying it‚Äôs poison just because you cba to research this is not the way to go
1/1	Instead of throwing the vaccine out, start pulling people off the street to give a shot.
0/0	Instead of violating our rights or releasing more useless vaccines, just improve the hospitals and hire more doctors!
0/-1/0	Insufficient data is not good enough ‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è
1/1	Intelligent people are vaccinated. Lucky are those who are already received their booster.
0/0	Interesting how hard this shot is being pushed. Raises red flags. Doctors warning against it are being canceled. Major red flag. Love that she says she has the right to question. Yes!
0/0	Interesting how most people would never consider buying a new car with no warranty but not even think twice about putting some chemical in their body made by some company that has full legal immunity which people have died from.
0/0	Interesting how the vaccine and rise in cases and they predict a rise as more in the next couple of months ...hmmmn..sound a little more than telling that they are not safe
0	Interesting how you know there will be future stains. Oh yeah, there is a reason why some call it the plan-demic. Good luck with your forever multiple jabs, mama may have raised a dummy but certainly not a fool.
0/0	Interesting that anti bodies only last a few month...but vaccine works??
0/0	Interesting that this discussion was 3 months ago, before the virus mutated into Omicron. It has indeed become more infectious which increases the number of people who will be overwhelmed by it. This is where the vaccines are starting to fail
0/0	Interesting they didn‚Äôt mention the facial paralysis after taking vaccine lol
0/0	Interesting, my step father had his first shot about a month and a half ago. Missed his second shot due to falling. He died 2 days ago complaining of a headache. Seriously its going to become time to keep your firearms very very close guys.
1/-1	Interesting. But did they take into account the new variants? For example, many people are being reinfected in Brazil with the new P.1 variant. I would love to see the real study and its limitations.
0/0	Interesting. How long have we been flattening the curve and how many shots are we supposed to have now? And now they are ‚Äúexploring a vaccine that would work well against all variants‚Äù. I am positive that in December of 2020 that was what we were all told the two shots were.
0/0	Interesting. It's almost like they haven't got a clue what vaccine does what. Yeah, it "should" protect you. Just give it try.
0/0	Interestingly enough, everyone I know who isn't vaxxed hasn't caught omicron yet and at least a quarter of the people I know who are vaxxed have it right now.
0	Introduce a vaccine in the late stages of a pandemic (just like measles and polio) and claim credit for its natural decline. This always works.
0/0	Invalid Argument From Authority on full display here. "I'm a doctor, therefore I'm right." Like everyone else on planet earth, this guy has no idea what's going to happen to people who have unwittingly participated in this medical experimen
0/-1	Investigating this for my brother .he nervous about getting vaccine .he had allergies as a kid and takes some medicines
0/0	Iow you are taking an experimental drug via injection. This is why President Trump always offered it as a Choice not a dictate. I refuse to get these "vaccines" because I refuse to be a subject and I am not dumb enough to inject myself with unknown substances. Those of you who ate can call the law offices at 3am.....
0/-1	Iris Figuora: I listed all the ingredients of the vaccine and contacted the Poisons Department. After intros and the like, and asking to speak to someone knowledgeable, this is the gist of that conversation. Me: My question to you is how are these ingredients categorized? As benign or as poison? (I checked a few ingredients, formaldehyde, Tween 80, mercury, aluminum, phenoxyethanol, potassium phosphate, sodium phosphate, sorbitol, etc.) He: Well, that's quite a list ... But it's easy to say that they are all poisonous to humans ... Used in fertilizers ... Pesticides ... To stop the heart ... To kill a dead body preserve ... They are registered with us in different categories, but quite a lot of poisons. Why? Me: If I intentionally fed or injected my child with these ingredients, often, as a schedule, of course I would put my daughter in danger ... But what would happen to me legally? He: Strange question ... But you would probably be charged with criminal negligence ... maybe with the intent to kill ... and of course child abuse ... Your child would be taken from you ... Do you know anyone does his child? This is criminal ... An industry ... These are the ingredients used in vaccines ... With binders to keep the body from leaching them ... To keep antibody levels high indefinitely ... He: WHAT ?! Your conclusion? The man was beside himself. He asked if I wanted to email him all this information. He wanted to share it with his grown children who are parents. He was appalled and hated that he didn't know ... his kids are vaccinated and they have health problems ... " ~ By Iris Figueroa Ô∏è INGREDIENTS OF VACCINES - YOU CANNOT make an informed decision without being educated. Here are just a few vaccine ingredients. These will be INJECTED in your children; Ô∏èFormaldehyde / Formalin - Highly toxic systemic poison and carcinogen. Ô∏èBetapropiolactone - Toxic chemical and carcinogen.

1/1	Ironic that people are afraid of a vaccine but are willing to devour fast food and sit on their ass all day.
1/0	Ironic that these children's parents are vaccinated and fine.. Well as fine as you can get to prefer a dead kid over an autistic kid. Anyone who wants a dead child over an autistic kid doesn't even deserve a kid.
1/1	Ironic. YOU dig deeper, instead of "digging" for controversial / conspiratorial information by clicking on the first result on Google.
0/0	Ironically the guy who died was 59 but the only concern is young people. I guess older people don't matter, it's a case of " "Thanks for your contribution to this country. You have served your useful purpose, goodbye"
0/0	Ironically the vaccine shows very little proof of protection from the original virus or any subsequent variant thereafter! If anything, the pathogenic priming could leave you substantially more susceptible to any future variant!
0/0	Irresponsible to say that the vaccines are ‚Äúsafe.‚Äù You don‚Äôt know the effect down the line of a 4th shot, nor of a 3rd, 2nd or 1st.
1/1	Is also their choice to take the vaccine, the big difference: your limp dick is not contagious, you‚Äôll have to get pleasure from someone else‚Äôs dick. COVID is contagious and can kill you or worst, it could kill someone else .
0/0	Is everyone ok with being injectd with an EXPERIMENTAL, toxic vax? They are making it up as they go a long, it's still a big NO from me
0/0	Is getting the vaccine or not on a spectrum too? I'm leaning to the NOT getting it side..
1/-1	Is he against vacations; just the ones for covid, or just for omicron? it's a strange attitude for a doctor to have but, hey! We're all human.
0/0	Is it a misinformation when someone's husband had a blood clot after getting their 2nd shot? so it's a NO for me!
1/0	Is it all possible that humans really made the impossible happen and came up with a great vaccine?
0/1	Is it bad that I‚Äôm more scared of getting the vaccine than getting Covid? I‚Äôm not anti vax at all, but I am so anxious about getting a vaccine that came out so fast. I‚Äôm worried about the horrible effects it could have and no I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs good for everyone
0/0	Is it just me or have you all noticed that as soon as the vaccine came out to give to the public, that‚Äôs exactly when the virus started mutating?
1/1	Is it possible to take it earlier?
0/-1	Is it relabeled expired Bird flu vaccines?
0/0	Is it true mRNA vaccines can change the cells in your body and by that I mean in a bad way

0/0	Is it true that the vaccines can lead to infertility or low sperm count on men?
0/-1	Is it weird if this made me cry?
0/0	Is it wise for those with a perfectly healthy immune system to get an experimental shot? A shot from a company with no liability to you should anything go wrong?
0/0	Is it wrong for me to skeptical to take a brand new drug considering in my lifetime I have seen Vioxx, fen-phen, and now Zantac recalled and/or linked to cancers and heart issues?
1/0	Is one safer than the other?
0/0	Is that the protein that inhibits placenta formation in human females? The one those two German doctors blew the whistle on and got silenced? Is that the same protein that has caused "false" positives for HIV? Yeah, that's completely fine, all of it and the other 30 or so diseases and syndromes, all just fine. Where can I sign the 2 release forms that negate any liability of the pharmaceutical companies for possible death with 2 days of receiving this experimental "vaccine"??
0/0	Is the #CovidVaccine turning recipients into super spreaders...
0/0	Is the vaccine safe? Not as safe as not taking it
0/0	Is the world under some type of mass hypnosis? I can't believe how many people are willingly getting the jab.

0/0/0	Is there any reason whatsoever for me to get this poison?
0/1	Is there any treatment available...no it's only to get vaccinated which is still not the kind of solution the world needs
0/0	Is this North Korea and I don't know it? They will never force this thing to me.
0/-1	Is this Vaccine safe for ASTHEMETIC and Heart Patients?
0/0	Is this a joke?? Biden and countless other said ... take THIS vaccine and you won't get COVID. And all they can say now is "oops." They say - the science changed. No it didn't. There WAS no "science" ... only opinions. I honestly can't envision people trusting another vaccine to do what the first didn'tz
0/0	Is this even safe? what if this vaccine is worse than the virus that has 99% survival rate.
0/0	Is this injection even a 'vaccine' by definition?
1/-1	Is this real? Please say it is, I am really sick and slightly scared about this and wish this whole Covid-19 horse shit would be over!!!!
0/-1	Is this real? There has to be something to nitpick in this. Please crush my dreams so I can't get my hopes up.
1/0	Is this suggesting that the effectiveness of 2 doses is nearly zero vs omicron?
0/-1	Is this vaccine really safe? Have enough clinical studies been done? I wld hate to think it gets the ok like thalidomide did- then causes major problems...
0/0	Is your magnetised arm from the vaccine now permanently attached to the car as well ... we can only hope.
0/0	Islam must reject the poison, do not be fooled people üôè
1/1	Isn't it absolutely incredible that ~1 year after the outbreak of COVID-19 we have interim data on 7 vaccines and 10's of millions of people are already vaccinated?!? This is a true testament to the power of science, incredibly dedicated people and a whole lot of hard work.
0/-1	Isn't it criminal to put your children into mortal danger?

0/-1	Isn‚Äôt it amazing how all of the birds, squirrels, dogs, cats and other wildlife aren‚Äôt affected? They don‚Äôt wear masks or use sanitizer.
0/0	Isn‚Äôt it funny that you are encouraged to go to another doctor for ‚Äúa second opinion‚Äù but there can only be one opinion when it comes to an experimental vaccine?
0/0	Isn‚Äôt refusing rather strong languages. I don‚Äôt want it cause biologically I‚Äôm better served allowing my immune system to beat covid un aided by an agent injected into my body. As have millions of people defeated covid with their evolutionary sound immune system.
0/0	Isn‚Äôt this discrimination?
0/0	Israel abolishes its health pass as Omicron also infects vaccinated people, says health ministry director. @olivierveran keeps the vaccine pass to piss off the unvaccinated. Electoral scandal
1/1	Israel has a higher vaccination rate than Georgia but 1/3 the deaths. How is that possible if more Vaccination=more death?
1/1	Israel is a tiny country. Arizona is doing well vaccinating people.
0/0	Israel is almost 100% vaccinated...correct? Why Then, if this 'shot' is So Wonderful, are the people of Israel still dying? --The almost constant ignorant answer I keep hearing is: It MAY HAVE been worse if they didn't get the 'shot'. "May Have" are the key words here. <<<May have means they don't know. My government has me SO CONFUSED! First they said get vaccinated...Then they said that it didn't work so I need a 2nd shot...then a 3rd...now a 4th.....WHAT??? Something just isn't sitting right, At least is seems to me.
0/0	Israel is overrun with Covid. The vaccines have failed. The experiment must stop.I had both vaccines"
0/0	Israel its only 9 millions population, and high vaccinenatted, but the case is very high then other country with more population
1/1	Israel sees big drop in COVID cases among vaccinated.
1/1	Israel started their vaccine rollout 6 weeks ago and is beginning to see its effects with constant drop of cases (esp in age people 60+). This is brought upon by simple vaccination requirements, great healthcare system, and proactive acquisition of vaccines
1/1	Israel: Another view of the vaccine effect. Nationwide, drop in the fraction of cases, hospitalizations, and critically ill in people 60 years old and above (who were prioritized first for vaccination) out of all age groups
1/1	Israeli data and guptas limited data reflects much lower protection afyer first dose and improves radically after second. Pfizers protocol is three weeks not 12.
1/0	Israeli data supports Pfizer vaccine effectiveness - 128,600 fully vaccinated, 20 positive COVID cases
0/-1	Israel‚Äôs population is over 80 percent vaccinated and yet are still seeing the highest number of covid cases that country has seen since the start of the pandemic üê∏ü´ñ
0/0	It absolutely affected me. Don't do it!
1/-1	It amazes me how much misinformation, lies, and sheer nastiness they can put into such a short "news" piece.
0/-1	It appears from the literature that natural infection provides immunity
0/0	It attacks a protein in the placenta rendering women sterile.
1/1	It baffles me so many dumb people are against vaccine in the middle of a freaking pandemic
1/1	It blows my mind that people still don‚Äôt believe in vaccines even after we‚Äôve seen it eradicated a whole disease
1/1	It boils down to this .. take the vaccine and your chances of having fatal or severe symptoms are greatly diminished. Refuse the vaccine and you and your immune system are on your own, It is that stark and simple.
1/1	It can be argued that the unknown effects of covid presents the same problems except possibly worse. We don‚Äôt know anything about this new virus, and it‚Äôs a big virus as far as viruses are concerned, with a lot of spikes - it possibly has a lot of tricks up it‚Äôs sleeve. Like chickenpox, it could lay dormant in your spine for years and present itself later on as shingles - wIt‚Äôs covid we don‚Äôt know. At least the vaccine has gone through trials - covid is doing its own trial on our population and it is doing quite a doozy. If areas keep on spreading we don‚Äôt know what could happen. We are lucky this virus is mild as far as viruses go, it could be far worse, infecting kids etc‚Ä¶. I say vaccinate.
1/1	It can be painful but worth it
0/0	It can't even be called a vaccine! The time of trial hasn't been respected at all! Look for other sources of information!
0/0	It cannot stop the virus
0/0	It can‚Äôt protect you from Covid
0/-1	It certainly does seem to be a very strange virus. Killed many in Wuhan and surrounding areas and yet not one case in nearby Beijing where all important ' stuff ' happens üòÇüòÇ
0/0	It changes your DNA & PUTS SOFTWARE IN YOUR BODY!! You'll Liberal creep! Aren't going to mention Bell's Palsey, the deaths, etc??? They killed 46 million with the Swine flu vaccine in the 70's, CDC, Gates and Fauchi!
1/1	It costs nothing. It takes ten minutes. It is safe. It works. GET THE FUCKING VACCINE or get the fuck out of my scene. We don't put people at risk. Not on purpose. Not when we can protect each other. It's that simple. GO. GET. VACCINATED.
0/0	It could be argued that these vaccines, or the policies that were built around them, have led to far more death and suffering than they have prevented.
0/0	It could kill all of the people everywhere. These 2 still believe in "safe vaccines", like Kennedy. That's nonsense. All vaccines are designed as poison, no life has been saved, ever, by vaccines.
1/-1	It cracks me up that people are saying, "but I had a sore arm." Well, when you jab a metal syringe into a muscle, you have to expect that. Political views aside, I'm a type 2 diabetic, so not even a question as to whether I should have gotten it. None. Benefits far outweigh the "risks."
0/0	It damages way more than it kills. 10% are long haulers even after a mild dose . It can cause organ and brain damage .
0/0	It does Not matter whether it is a hoax or not. The fact is FREEDOM of Choice. My Body, My Choice to not or to take it. I've been here six and a half decades, without taking any Medication or visiting a Doctor. Why start Now. "don't fix it, if it ain't broken".
0/0	It does have potential side effects
0/1	It does matter if a healthy 20 y/o gets vaccine, because that's an opportunity for the virus to mutate.
0/0	It does not end the pandemic!!! It's the biggest lie ever perpetrated on mankind! Stop the deadly vaccine!!
0/0	It does not prevent death. It does not guarantee that I will not be infected again.
1/1	It does stop the spread of Covid if enough people are vaccinated. This is known to happen with all infectious diseases. There is a lot of information on herd immunity on internet.
0/0	It doesn't affect your body if you don't take it.
0/0	It doesn't even protect you from the first variant
0/0	It doesn't help that RNA vaccines crash your lymphocyte counts for up to a week, leaving you open to infections (possibly including Covid?) They do know about this from both the b1 & b2 trials.
1/1	It doesn't matter whether the public want or don't want vaccine passports. We will NEED them. It's not enough to have a jab - you will need to keep your regular booster jabs up. A bit like an MOT, a vaccine passport will prove that you are up to date with protection.
0/0	It doesn't matter! Stop f**** with freedom of choice. If we feel vaccinations are horseshit then just leave us alone and we'll deal with it. If you all want to stick your kids with this poison that's your prerogative. Vaccinations simply are not needed.
0/0	It doesn't prevent anything and people have been hospitalized for severe side effects and some died. This shot is dangerous.
0/0	It doesn? feel like it? right for me , gut feeling the vaccine isn? readyCertainly don? care what you do with your bodyBut when I think about it I feel no with my whole being . So that? that for me- not antivax I just don? think that one is for me
0/0	It doesnt work and it kills.
0/0	It doesn‚Äôt even protect you from COVID
0/0	It doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs right for me
1/1	It doesn‚Äôt matter what we think. The consensus of the medical community is that you need to get vaccinated. Listen to the medical community, not random people on the internet.
0/0	It doesn‚Äôt seem that either one of them would rush you get the vaccine. I am 64, and I am certainly NOT.
0/0	It failed them scientists decades till now to get aids vaccine,, but it has taken them 8 months to get media flu scammed vaccine
1	It feels great to be part of the solution instead of part of the problem.
1/1	It feels like a good day to remind folks that vaccines work and vaccines save lives
0/-1	It freaks me out that the vaccine will be distributed based on skin color and not based on health and age.
1/1	It got all of us (4) over Thanksgiving and the 1st week of December. Very glad we were all vaxxed; we felt gross but it was manageable. Thanks for the message and sharing with humor.
1/1	It got me. Good job i'm fully jabbed = less severe illness, reduced chance of hospitalisation
1/1	It had been a hard year. It has been a challenging year. This vaccine is the best thing to come out of this year and can do the most to start our best defense for our future. Roll up your sleeves, fellow Americans, and take a brave step into a better future! Aloha
0/0	It had never been used and they skipped critical trials. Now people are dying.
1/-1	It hard to argue with crazy peaple Crazy means to ignore facts
0/0/0	It has Johnson in the name ...no thanks
1/1	It has a 94%+ efficacy rate in terms of preventing COVID completely, and 100% efficacy rate (based on this recent data) in preventing severe cases. The prior number alone is incredible for a vaccine.
1/1	It has already come to this. Hospital capacities are exhausted in many places, and previous surgery schedules can no longer be adhered to. And all this because unvaccinated Corona patients in particular are already occupying the beds.
1/1	It has always been emphasised that the vaccines would not stop people becoming infected with COVID 19 but that they would give protection against serious illness thus helping to minimise hospital admissions and reduce deaths. It seems sensible to remind everyone of this.
0/1	It has been reported that some of the side effects of the Oxfuurd, AstraZeneca vaccine are making normal citizens show alarming signs of ultra yooonyinism. An unknown source stated that watching bbc or sky news may also acutely further effect your ability to function normally.
1/-1	It has helped convince my wife to get the vaccine.
1/-1	It has killed people.
0/0	It has more deaths then all other vaccines combined in less then 1 year.
0/0	It has never been about health.
0/0	It has not been tested
0/-1	It has nothing to do with a v'1rus and everything to do with control and greed.
0/-1	It has nothing to do with health and probably never did. The Rothschilds will never let Italy go
1/1	It has to be a safer option than getting Covid-19 and spreading it.
0/0	It hasn't even been a full year but yet there's already a vaccination for a virus that we know barely anything about out but there isn't a vaccination for a diseases that have been studied for years...
1	It helps break the chain of COVID-19 transmission.
0/0	It honestly scares me
0/0	It is EXPERIMENTAL We should not be in such a rush to put all of our 'front line' people at a possible risk.
1/1	It is WAY more effective than no vaccine!
0/1	It is a back-and-forth kind of game. Soon we will realize that all the vaccinations were in fact aiding the virus to grow stronger.
1/1	It is a blast! I got it yesterday and I am doing sports today with no side-effects! May God bless science.
0/0	It is a crime to force people to take your vaccine, set down in Nuremberg after WW2. And it‚Äôs a war crime that will put you in front of a military court. Look it up.
0/0	It is a joke that people still believe in the vaccines. This is a business and we are a clients. Vaccines make as perfect clients, infinite shots useless vaccines $$$ good for the pharmaceutical companies
0/0	It is a nightmare! 99,8 ,% survival probability and still the people get in line to get jabbed.Now they try to force the opponents who do not believe in this pandemic scenario. Just search Ellen Brown"Another big bailout under cover of a Virus" all the rest is Propaganda! Or do you seriously believe the Government worldwide take care of our health? They do not mind about the quality of our daily food, full of gliphosate, pesticides ,nitrates and cancer causing substances.they allow every year tons of nuclear waste, they allow pouring chemical in our river and consents pollution of millions of cars every day, but they are worried because we have a 0,2% probability of death in case we get infected with Covid-19? Follow the money! Or read Fabio Vighi "Selffullying Prophecy"
0/0/0	It is a pathogen! Dangerous!! This is not a TESTED vaccine. This will make millions for Gates, AMAZON. There are now different strains of the virus. Another democratic danger
1/1	It is a shame not to get vacciness now that we have them.some people ar soo ungreateful!
0/0	It is about implanting people with chips or some other shit.
1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1	It is absolutely incredible how far we've come in science and medicine. We all owe a great deal of gratitude to the thousands of hard-working scientists and doctors who are helping us end this pandemic. So thankful.
1/1	It is absolutely the greatest showing of our collective, global scientific output and such a rare opportunity in history for us to actually measure it. The common enemy that unites us, and allows us a small window in history in which the whole science community, across disciplines focus on one objective.
0/0	It is all a lie and a plan for the Cabal to take over the world. search and watch for Even 201. Bill Gates can take my shot.
0/0	It is all spare, you do not need a vaccine.
0/0	It is almost as if the Lobbyists themselves wrote the health care bill.
0/0	It is almost like the vaccine is a lie
1/1/1/1/1/1	It is amazing that modern medicine is able to do this.
1/1	It is and the vaccine is very safe. It's a dumb decision.
1/1	It is astounding how many of the commenters rely on lies and refuse to accept anything that goes against their bias. Giving them the truth seems almost pointless. This is herd mentality and behavior of cultists.
1/1	It is being developed and tested by reputable companies with scientist researchers who know what they are doing. It was tested on 40,000 people of various ages. Press releases report 90 percent or higher efficiency. Edit: now in mid 2021 we have millions vaccinated with very rare side effects of concern. Way safer than getting COVID
1/1	It is beyond any human logic that many people still comment that the deaths from Covid-19 are caused by the Flu and the vaccine. I totally support free speech but to leave comments like this in a news site is not only Trumpism but immoral. I demand action fron Administrators
0	It is common sense...when you inject something unnatural into your bloodstream, your bloodflow may be affected
1/1	It is commonsense for me to get vaccinated, wear a mask, social distance, and live a healthy life.
0/0	It is criminal that these vaccination experiments are allowed to continue. Boris you will have blood on your hands if you don't stop them now.
1/1	It is done. 2nd jab. Completed mate
1/1	It is easy‚Ä¶.no medical treatment for voluntary unvaxxed‚Ä¶
1/1	It is everyone's right to decide whether to get this vaccine. That being said, once its widely available I'm dropping the mask and I have no remorse for anyone who keels over due to the rona at that point. You made your choice.
1/1	It is exactly the same as any vaccination, yes there will be rare people who react to it badly! But because every body is different that is expected and cant be helped! If it works for the mass of the population then its good!
1/1	It is exciting to see the first successful vaccine... and there are 10+ vaccines by other companies right behind this one.
1/1	It is extreamely selfish not getting vaccinated
1/1	It is frustrating that people don't understand that vaccinations so far have kept a lot of people out of hospitals, even then relieving their own work situation.
1/1	It is global issue, we have to act together. Good solidarity is needed among all regardless rich or poor countries. No one should be left behind. Vaccines should be for all, not only for the riches.
1/-1	It is good to vaccinated in urban area were over crowd of people, but how can COVID_19 can spread in remote area..,it is an individual option to choose
0/0	It is harassment to keep asking me once I have declined. Harassment is what criminals do.
1/1	It is important that we have enough vaccine for everyone who needs it, as well as an ethical and equitable distribution strategy. We need both.
0/0	It is impossible to do all the test so fast
0/0	It is irresponsible to promote a vax that's given with no proper informed consent, is not a real vax, causes spread of Covid, ruins the immune system (VAIDS), and caused 23,000 deaths and 1.9 million injuries. Do your due diligence. You're being lied to about needing this vax.
1	It is just as good in preventing deaths.
1/1	It is like a new filter or flu shot. Take one every 6 months. nobody complains about those.
1/1	It is mild and safe.
1/-1	It is mind blowing how she said she don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs in it - I‚Äôm pretty sure she doesn‚Äôt know what‚Äôs in most of the stuff she consumes on a daily.
1/1	It is necessary to vaccinate the vulnerable group of people as soon as possible.
0/-1	It is none of anyone else‚Äôs business if I have been vaccinated or not
0/1	It is normal to have certain reactions after a vaccination: There may be redness, swelling or pain around the injection site
0/0	It is not a vaccine it is gene therapy. I totally agree with vaccines but this has not had all clinical trials including animal testing. Long term affects could be serious
0/0	It is not a vaccine!!!!
0/0	It is not a vaccine. It does not immunise. It doesn't protect. It's a transmitter and receiver. It screws up the immune system. It triggers cardiac and blood anomalies. It's an experimental magnetic nanotechnology. It kills. It's bad.
0/0	It is not a vaxxxine but a SYNTHETIC PATHOGEN injection an ddeaths rocketred after injections started!? Heart attacks and strokes came back in fashion with doctors!? Are doctors falsifying health record/death certificates!?!?
1/-1	It is not as effective but it is an option for people who didn‚Äôt want the strong moderne or Pfizer vacc .
1/0	It is not due to the vaccination. Just trust your government and obey it's rules
0/0	It is not even a vaccine at this point. I guess it‚Äôs only ‚Äúfollow the science‚Äù when it‚Äôs convenient for them.
1/1	It is not okey to not take the vaccine
0	It is not safe: SOURCE: DR. MERCOLA Reports of deaths and serious injuries from the COVID-19 jabs have been mounting with breakneck rapidity. Those who look at the numbers and have some awareness of historical vaccine injury rates agree we‚Äôve never seen anything like it, anywhere in the world. While data can be hard to come by for some countries, the ones we can check reveal deeply troubling patterns. ‚Ä¢ United States ‚Äî As of June 11, 2021, the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) had posted 358,379 adverse events,1 including 5,993 deaths and 29,871 serious injuries. In the 12- to 17-year-old age group, there were 271 serious injuries2 and seven deaths. Among pregnant women, there were 2,136 adverse events, including 707 miscarriages or premature births.3 All of these are bound to be undercounts as, historically, less than 10% of vaccine side effects are reported to VAERS.4 An investigation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services put it as low as 1%.5,6 Be that as it may, the reported rate of death from COVID-19 shots now exceeds the reported death rate of more than 70 vaccines combined over the past 30 years, and it‚Äôs about 500 times deadlier than the seasonal flu vaccine,7 which historically has been the most hazardous. The COVID shots are also five times more dangerous than the pandemic H1N1 vaccine, which had a 25-per-million severe side effect rate.8,9 Assuming the COVID shots had the same side effect rate, and assuming some 200 million got the vaccine, the estimated number of people suffering a serious side effect would be about 5,000. We‚Äôre well past that already, as 35,86410 people have been seriously injured or killed. Even though there are nearly 6,000 reported deaths in VAERS, this number is likely seriously compromised. I recently interviewed Dr. Vladimir Zelenko, who has treated COVID patients quite successfully, and we discussed the very distinct possibility that everyone who receives the COVID jab may die from complications in the next two to three years. He personally knows of 28 COVID jab deaths that were not accepted by VAERS. Zelenko suspects the number of deaths may exceed 100,000 already. Getting the COVID jab immediately places the injected individual in the very high risk of dying from COVID. Most have the false assurance that they are protected, but in reality, they are far more vulnerable and as a result will not take very aggressive proactive measures to avoid dying from pathogenic priming or paradoxical immune enhancement before it is too late. Please be sure and make a notation in your calendar to review my groundbreaking interview with Zelenko this Sunday, July 4, 2021, which is only three days away. We will review protocols you can use to protect you and your family or those you love, who now regret getting the COVID jab.
0/0	It is not tested enough
1/1	It is not that HARD... Help OTHERS AND GET THE VACCINE...
0/0	It is of no benefit if you happen to be the one with the blood clots !
1/1	It is of the utmost importance that people understand that vaccines are the only way-out of this pandemic.
1/-1	It is panic-driven recklessness.
1/1	It is proven that the vaccine prevents catastrophic illness and death. Trudeau may have saved you and/or your family and friends.
0/0	It is quite interesting that the vaccination should develop its full protection after an infection has been experienced, because obviously the vaccination cannot prevent it.
1/1	It is really important that every one take it
0/0	It is really often very sad how one is also attacked from one's own ranks because one is still not vaccinated and therefore no longer socially acceptable.
1/1	It is really work!!
1/1	It is recommended that you get vaccinated even if you have had covid-19.
1/1	It is remarkable how people say "don't get vaccinated because someone is pressuring you" while at the same time pressuring their environment not to get the vaccine.
1/0	It is sad how the anti-vaccine movement has grown in this pandemic, not due to facts and logic, but absurd conspiracies. We are doomed. Smithers, shoot me.
1/1	It is sad to see how some people so quickly choose to believe uneducated conspiracy theorists on the internet over educated doctors and scientists. One question: When was the last time any conspiracy theorist has been correct about something???
1/1	It is safe and effective.
1/1	It is safe on the short term, as determined by the data. Long term Ill effects of the vaccine are unknown as the vaccine has not yet been given to a large population. Don‚Äôt forget that you take risks every day. A short trip in a car is probably far more dangerous than the vaccine that has been studied as thoroughly as possible given the short period of time allotted.
1/1	It is safe to get oxford/Astrazenca vaccination few weeks after recovering from Covid-19
1/1	It is simple...get vaccinated and your chances of hospitalization and death greatly decrease.
1/1	It is strange that most anti vaxxers cannot pass high school chemistry and biology , yet they go around pretending to be smarter than scientists and doctors.
1/1	It is the amoral, anti-social, egocentric views of those turning down the vaccine that worry me.
1/1	It is the beginning of the end. Such relief. It makes me mentally feel better already
0/0	It is the flu and that is at a very low level so why more vaccines ?
0/0	It is the long term effects that are the problem. Tell us in a few months how glad you are you got it.
0/0	It is the result of so much misinformation. Why should we take a vaccin that has secrets? I am not against other vaccins, only this one.
1	It is the unvaccinated who are putting pressure on our already overstretched NHS and the sooner they realise it the better.
0/0	It is time for Fauci and Brandon to walk away from this. It's over, the science says let the Omicron run throgh the population and create herd resistance. Only the most vulnerable will die and we can treat it like a bad flu. If you want a Covid shot every year so be it if not, your body,your choice.
0/-1	It is time to stand up for your rights. No one else is going to do it for you!!!
0/-1	It is time to stop scaring people about the vaccine AND quit demanding everyone get the vaccine.
1/1	It is totally reasonable that we should vaccinate the people that are regularly volunteering, both as a public health measure because they are in proximity to lots of people
0/0	It is true that vaccine gives ADHD
1/1	It is true, vaccines are effective and it's normal to get side effects but that doesn't make them unsafe. They're also better than getting covid.
1/-1	It is truly amazing how fast the pharmaceutical industry can move when confronted with a global pandemic.
0/0	It is unbelievable that billions of people are being vaccinated with an experimental vaccine from a private company that has been condemned dozens of times and is run by a vet
0/0	It is unclear how long an infected persons antibodies last, it is also unclear how long the vaccine lasts!! So why take the vaccine??
0/0	It is unheard of to vaccinate people by force for something so common as a new flu.
1/1	It is very well tested. I assume you went to school sometime. You got vaccinated. you get this one for the same reasons so that everyone is not constantly giving it to each other. Get vaccinated. End of convo.
1/1	It is vitally important that we all work together to not only raise awareness and dispel misinformation about the #CovidVaccines, but also to help EVERYONE get vaccinated so that we can overcome this pandemic and heal as a nation and global community.
1/1	It is wonderful the new vaccine
0/0	It isnt safe and they know it but still push it putting money before health. People are dying around the world after having this untested ' cocktail and they are covering it up by not reporting the truth ! Just carrying on lying to the public its disgusting.
0/0	It isnt safe and they know it but still push it putting money before health. People are dying around the world after having this untested ' cocktail and they are covering it up by not reporting the truth ! Just carrying on lying to the public its disgusting..
0	It isn‚Äôt about health, it‚Äôs about compliance. It‚Äôs about confusion and division. It‚Äôs about pharmaceutical profits.
0/0	It isn‚Äôt safe. It could easily have killed me, because I got DVT after having the vaccine. I won‚Äôt have the second vaccine, even when they threaten to put me in prison, which I guess will happen around the middle of September.
1/-1	It just amazed me how ridiculous people can be. The reason the vaccine was made so quickly is because they got all the experts from around the world to help with it. They don't do that with other vaccines. The nurse I'm shocked by. Her job is not just a job but a vocation. She's supposed to help people get better. America seems to be one huge asylum.
1/1	It just horrifies me that most modern vaccine skepticism is based on lies that vaccines will lead to ASD"
0/0	It just killed a perfectly healthy 38yr old woman the other day. I‚Äôm good taking my chances living free without the face control device and getting cancer or neurological problems down the road for your vax.
0/0	It just so happens I am one of those rare people who will react to any rare side affects!! So he can lie all he wants too!! I will refuse the shot until I die!! He is a ü§•ü§°
1/1	It keeps you out of the hospital which is good enough for me.
0/0	It kills 10% of the ppl taking it. It also disables 25% of the ppl. That's bad, not good.
0/-1	It kills people
1/1	It looks like I'm behind around 20 million or so. I'll get my vaccines the moment I am allowed to!
0/0	It looks like bottled piss.
0/0	It make it to where you are going to hell sorry I had to say it it‚Äôs the first step to the new world order and the mark of the beast
1/0	It makes me cry every time to hear children dying for something that the parents could have prevented.
0/0	It makes no sense how the vaccine saved your partners life when truth be told, he may have experienced the same or less or worse (there's no way to know) without the vaccine. There is no proof that it helps ANYTHING.
0/0	It may be too early to say the vaccines are unsafe but it is too early to say they are safe too. Normally it takes at least a decade to develop a vaccine, and this mRNA vaccines are something totally new to us, so who knows? What do you know? I‚Äôd like to wait and see for at least a decade.
0/-1	It may have side effects.
1/1	It may not be harmless but the pill and aspirin have a higher risk than the vaccine
1/1	It might be good to still get the vaccine. There are many strains of covid19
1/1	It might be helpful
0/0	It must be exhausting to keep repeating logic & facts to people that aren't listening. There's no social responsibility/liability for vaccines harms so I'd suggest those enforcing the vaccines are selfish.
1/1	It needs to be said, and I wish the news did. None of these vaccines have any affect on pregnancy or fertility. Sore holder and fatigue are the most common side effects. All of these laws are common sense and safe, your miss information or fear of something does not give you the right to endanger others.
1/1	It never ceases to amaze me how much correlation there seems to be between views as disparate as "vaccines are dangerous", "HCQ is effective against COVID", "wearing a mask is useless", and "news cases are caused by recent 'riots'". What could the latent variable be?
0/0	It never passed standard science checks and balances. In fact no corona vaccine has ever passed science; ever. Also no mRNA vax has ever passed basic science trials either.
0/0	It only protects you from getting fired from your job lol
0/0/0	It produces impotence. Watch out people.
1/1/1/1	It really frustrates me that the antivaxxers got way more time to speak and just ignored literally everything the doctor said
1/-1	It really pisses me off how many headlines I see each day begging me to take the vaccine. Fucking give me one! I'm the one begging for it ffs
0/0	It really saddens me to see this many ppl who dont mind getting repeated injections of the most harmful chemical's known to man. Wake up ppl!
1/1	It reduces the severity when you get COVID.
0/0	It s not inconceivable that there is actually a deadly or at least serious respiratory flu and that a quickly developed vaccine reduces the severity.
1/0	It scares me, I'd rather get the virus than get a rushed vaccine
0/-1	It seems clear now that as COVID goes endemic, only variant-specific vaccines will be effective. I recently recovered from omicron after being double-vaxxed. I won t bother with any more shots unless there is evidence it is effective against whatever the current variant is.
0/0	It seems like everything about this vaccine is unclear, how did they manage to get approved so quickly? hmmm. did you all forget that we are all equipped with an immune system... take care of your body and it will take care of you
0/0	It seems like people don't know that they're being guinea pigs to the vaccine. The vaccine hasn't formally been approved yet, only authorized for emergency use. Even when it's formally approved, there's no guarantee of it being safe, as there's a lot of corruption.
0/1	It seems like so far even those who got covid after vaccine had mild cases so hopefully it will still help.
0/0	It seems that this vaccine is on the dangerous side.
0/0	It seems to me reckless to be pushing people to take risks when you don‚Äôt know what the risks are.
0	It seems to me that for high risk of Covid categories the vaccine is a lower risk than Covid. However for the vast majority of the population for which the risk from Covid is tiny, or non existent the vaccine benefit risk equation is debatable to say the least
0/0	It should alarm you that we are heading toward a society where you will have to offer up unlimited access to your veins in exchange for permission to live a normal life.,
0/0/0/0/0	It should alarm you that we are heading toward a society where you will need to offer up unlimited access to your veins in exchange for permission to live a normal life.
0/0	It should alarm you that we are heading toward a society where you will need to offer up unlimited access to your veins in exchange for the ability to live a normal life.
1/1	It should also be noted that this is only in the context of the timeframe studied. It‚Äôs unknown how long this protection will last.
1/1	It should be a mandatory cause, the WHO could probably agree to do something in countries that enforces it.
1/1	It should be a mandatory vaccination drive, when it's about the collective good you don't want to take chances on anti-vax crowd
1/1	It should be free once it is released, it is for the benefit of the society, not individuals.
1/1	It should be noted that COVID-19 antivaxxers saying people died BECAUSE of the vaccine are the same ones saying that just because someone died having COVID-19 that DOESN‚ÄôT mean they died because of COVID-19!üßê
1/-1	It should be required
1/1	It should be required to refuse non-emergency medical treatment to any parent who refuses to vaccinate their child.
0/0	It shouldn't be mendatory
1/-1/-1	It shouldn't give anyone pause about whether the vaccine is safe or not
1/1	It shows the utter hypocrisy of those anti-vaxxers. Either they do not believe what they preach or they do not care about the other person's health
0/0	It sincerely bothers me to see them injecting the ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù in that kid, while he is being restrained by hands and also a car seat. The mother or father must have not properly read the consent form where it says ‚Äú I understand that the long term effects and complications are unknown at this time‚Äù. Infuriating.
0/0	It still fucks with your antibodys because of its interaction with your body's antibody system. I'm going to avoid covid and the covid shot, thanks
0/0	It still has a 99.7% survival rate without the jab. Make this make sense.
1/1	It strenghtens the inmune system!
0/1	It sucks that the side effect of the covid 19 vaccine are worse than covid 19 side effects.
1/1	It sure will be. I get my 1st vaccine shot at 12:45. I am so excited. Stay safe and take care of each other.
0/0	It takes 5 to 10 years to completely check safety in a vaccine NOT a few weeks.
1/1	It takes a minimum of 14 to 15 years for a drug to get an approval to come into market There's certain procedures and protocol being followed all over world for a pharmacological dept. To approve a drug It undergoes a lot of clinical trials and only drugs which are efficient and safe will be approved for use In the same way covid vaccine went through all the procedures and protocol ,all the clinical trials all these months and has been approved all over world this quick because we are in an emergency situation So its very safe ,highly preventive of getting covid
1/0/-1	It takes a video like this to realize that at least half of the population is actually far dumber than you think.
0/0	It takes approximately 7 years to make a safe and available vaccine.
0/1	It takes at least a decade (10 years) to fully understand the potential of a vaccine on animals but lest just skip all the trials in an emergency mandate ü§°ü•ºü§°ü•ºü§°ü•ºü§°ü•º
0/0/0/0	It takes years and sometimes decade's to get it right. I think this one is a dangerous one.
0/0	It takes years of trial and error to confidently pledge your life on a vaccine. How can doctors so easily administer these vaccines like a flu shot. As Doctors you should weigh the risks.
0/0	It took less than 5 years of Thalidomide prescriptions before the link of birth defects was discovered. Experimental vaccine with no manufacturer liability, it just shows how gullible the sheep are, I‚Äôll take my chances thanks
1/0	It took only 15 mints to get my Puhpoo vaccinated in CDA medical centre G9 #good arrangements #CovidVaccine #GetVaccinated
0/0	It turns you in to a flesh eating √∞≈∏¬ß≈∏√¢‚Ç¨ÔÜç√¢‚Ñ¢‚Äö√Ø¬∏ÔÜè.
1/1	It uttely astonishes me that there are groups of people in this day and age who don't believe in vaccines! Had a very heated discussion with an anti-vacciner who simply was bent on proving to me that he was immune to covid-19
1/1	It varies a lot by socio-economic status and race. FWIW, I don‚Äôt know any anti-vaxxers either.
1/1	It was a privilege to be the @pfizerinc clinical trial. Thank you for a vaccine to help end the pandemic!!
1/1	It was a privilege to give out vaccines today. Proud of the #ucsd #covidvaccine effort at petco #padres! An amazing effort to get out the vaccine!
1/1	It was about time! Don‚Äôt forget this is the most tested vaccine in medicine. Approx. 3 billion doses !
0/0	It was advertised for those at risk at first, then all adults, then mandates, then 12 and up, then 5 and up, then a third shot, now soon for under 5.
1/1	It was also found to be more than 94 per cent effective in people over the age of 65
0/0	It was created to fast
0/-1	It was fast tracked. I will wait until 100% safe .
1	It was good. Tastes like mango. But it's not my favourite vaccine.
1/1	It was just recently approved in the UK though. Hopefully it goes well.
0/-1	It was never about a virus It was always about control
0/0	It was never about a virus It was always about control.
0/-1	It was never about the virus. But all about the vaccine. Why kill millions when you can just sterilize them?
0/0	It was never about your health, it‚Äôs about your compliance and how far they can push themselves on your lives.
0/0	It was not my anecdote... it was the doctors... the kid was paralyzed from the neck down after he was vaccinated and it was DUE to the vaccination But that is ok though right... just collateral damage attained in the never ending search for the perfect "herd" immunity during our march toward some retarded version of "progress". People like you are hopeless because you confuse memorizing skewed stats and industry jargon with actual intelligence and critical thinking ability. You think you know science, but it has more in common with a religion than it does actual science.
0/0	It was not safe for Lisa Shaw, of the BBC for instance. Confirmed death due to the vaccine.
1/1	It was quick and painless. Make sure you all get it to protect your family, friends and your community! Thank you NHS
0/0	It was rushed and almost definitely not a good idea to take it. Thanks we knew this already.
0/0	It was rushed and prematurely authorized. The FDA has financial gains in this jab. I WILL NEVER TAKE THIS! Natural immunity for me
1/0	It was tested on 44,000+ participants in a double blinded placebo study. Half of the patients received the vaccine, other half received the placebo.
0/0	It was the AstraZeneca shot that was causing blood clots.
1/1	It was the first one available to me and I was overjoyed to have it. Also boosted with it. So far, it‚Äôs doing it‚Äôs job with zero side effects! Feeling very grateful for J&J!
0/0	It was the vaccine. We know he died from the vaccine!
0/0	It was them being caught in a lie. This was the case since the beginning. Vaccinated people still died from covid even when the vaccines were first distributed for "alpha" variant.
0/0	It wasn't Covid that killed her. It was the vaccine. Sorry for your loss.
0/0	It wasnt untill i did my own research and found out that the vaccine is pure poison!!
1/0	It will be a cold day in hell before my granddaughters take this poison.
0/0	It will be a great Christmas for all of the big pharma shareholders
1/0	It will be a hell of a life, being unvaccinated
0/0	It will be a whole country that will have a Bill Gates micro chip in them by May. That should make Bill happy.
0/0	It will be denied by ..parents.. faster than you think.
1/1	It will be great to have medical personnel vaccinated after all of these stressful months. Science saves!
0/0	It will change our dna...I refuse a doctor in florida died after getting it and iv heard of alot of deaths. .their trying to do population control that's us...scary... but I'm right with lord so I pray others wake up God bless
0/0/0/0	It will edit you genes, put new thoughts in your head, and destroy your body. i choose fema camp over covid vaccine anyday. Repeating a lie big enough does not work on me. wamp, wamp.
0/0	It will give you cancer
1/1	It will help more or less
0/0	It will kill more than the viras.
0/0	It will likely give many people cancer
1/1	It will never go away as long as one Anti-Vaxxer is roaming free spreading it.
0/-1	It will only take one of these variants to be able to 'get around' the immune response activated by the current vaccines, and the whole process will begin again from 'square one'. I think that is what is going to happen so they will have to constantly keep modifying the vaccines. It will mean years of lockdowns, masks, etc. What is really needed is a 'silver bullet' antiviral drug that knocks out the coronavirus type regardless of chemical structural changes in the spike protein. Vaccines are inherently unreliable in a population of genetically altering viruses.

Vaccines are inherently unreliable in a population of genetically altering viruses. Which, by the way, does not mean that you should not have them. GET YOUR JABS!
1/1	It will prevent the COVID-19 virus from spreading and replicating, which allows it to mutate and possibly become more resistant to vaccines
0/0	It will probably give you syphilis
1	It will protect me after injection.
1/1	It will stop you killing people by passing it on and might save you too if you catch it - is that good enough for you
1/1	It will take time to vaccinate enough people and this assuming that they will accept to get the vaccine. Bottom line it' s still a rocky ride keep the belt fasten for 5 months
0/1	It won't end because of the vaccine, herd immunity is the way we go back to normal. Not the new normal. The Wuhan virus will probably be around just like all the other flu's, only there won't be lockdowns. It was a test and is still in progress.
0/0	It won‚Äôt even prevent transmissions so it‚Äôs safer and more effective to just get the virus and develop immunity.
1/1	It worked for smallpox and polio. It even worked for measles for a while until enough people became anti-vax. So yeah vaccine mandates work
0/0	It works , but we can‚Äôt prove it, just trust... nice advertising
1/1	It worries me that people would rather listen to conspiracy theorists than actual doctors and scientists about the Covid vaccine
1/1	It would be better if people got the vaccine
0/1	It would be great if our former president would do a PSA saying the Covid-19 vaccines are safe.
1/1	It would be great if the city had more appt. only vaccine clinics vs. the mass vaccination clinics without appointments. Most people are working and can't wait around for hours to get the vaccine. An appt. would allow people to schedule time off from work to get their vaccine.
1/-1/-1	It would be great if you specified which variant you are cofidently referring to in regaurds to efficacy. Because now it has been proven thise numbers only apply to the original strain, not the variants.
0/-1	It would be hard for me to access one.
1/1	It would be nice if they were available.
1/1	It would be pretty stupid for them to roll out an unsafe vaccine to the entire military... if they force armed services to take this vaccine, itll be because its proven safe. They're not going to risk it.
1/-1	It would help put this in perspective if articles listed total number of covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths in same time period. Compare infections in overall population to vaccinated population. And note how many infections and deaths were prevented by vaccines.
0/0	It wouldn't be worth the risk to me. If one in a thousand could react to the point of death; would you be willing to take that chance? Not me.
1/1	It wouldn‚Äôt hurt to draw back in any case. I‚Äôm going to make sure they do for my second shot of Pfizer too.
0/1	It'll be a cold day in hell before I ever get a vaccine especially from the government
1/1	It'll be such a relief hearing people are getting the vaccine
1/1/1/1	It'll be such a relief hearing people are getting the vaccine.. even if it's slow at first, it'll be great to get some good news.
1/1	It'll protect us FOREVER!
0/0	It's A Death Shot Period!!
0	It's ALL part of the bullshit show.. This pandemic was intentionally released by our own Government to kill off the elderly and poor/ low income people so they won't have to pay out unemployment, or disability or social security or medical fees.. killing off the people with weakened immune systems. There are too many people in the world. This is a way of taking care of that issue. It was made in a lab, and it got too out of control.
0/0	It's Abit cringworthy doing this if you ask me no one does it for the flu Vaccine
0/0	It's Fri 2/7/22 now we can say vaccines were not the ultimate answer for Covid-19.üò≠üò≠üò≠
0/0	It's NEW technology, so it's impossible to know the long term side effects .. For example a year from now, or 5 years from now .. NO THANK YOU, I WON'T TAKE THE SHOT .. Obviously Many Doctors (some not even real Doctors) will be shills and promote the vaccine ..
1/-1	It's a Miracle!!! üòè
1/1	It's a blast! I got it yesterday and I am doing sports today with no side-effects! May God bless science.,
0/0	It's a cold, relax fascists
1/1	It's a good thing that the medical staff have been done first, as they were in the front line of the virus
0/0	It's a lethal doctrine. 85 of the world's poorest countries are unlikely to get widespread access to vaccines until 2023: that's two more years for the virus to mutate into deadlier variations and re-infect people whose vaccinations have worn off.
0/0/0/0	It's a lethal injection. It's killing people
0/0	It's a medical mery-go-round. And lots of $$$ for pharma from now into forever...
1/1	It's a no brainer to take the vaccine
0/0	It's a no for me. however, let's not shame others for wanting to get the vaccine. It's all about choice at the end of the day.
0/0	It's a pity we can't get a vaccine against the BBC misinformation.
0/0	It's a poison not a vaccine
0/0	It's a simple analysis of risk-reward ratio. I'm young, healthy with no underlying health conditions. I don't want the covid vax as I consider it unnecessary and there's a potential element of risk.
1/1	It's acceptable to have a healthy dose of skepticism for anything, however I trust the doctors, researchers, and everyone who had hands on developing this more than a random tin-foil hat wearing youtuber saying it'll turn me into a gay frog.
1/1	It's actually good for low risk high activity people to get vaccinated because they can easily spread the virus and not know.
0/0	It's against my doctrine to take vaccine.
0	It's all BS. It was always about the vaxx. C19 was released for the purpose of the vaxx, for $$$, genocide & population control. Totalitarian takeover. When CCP & the global elite released the C-19 bioweapon it was an act of war against the human race. Going back to normal was never the plan. Dig deep for truth. The Lions are awake but the Sheep still sleep.
0/0	It's all a lie Stupid, brainwashed idiots The vaccine does NOTHING
0/0	It's all a loads of wank no vaccine is not gonna stop the spend of covid it's out of control
0/0	It's all a trick. Covid tests don't actually mean anything, and the vaccines provide no benefit to your health.
0/0	It's all about control
0/-1	It's all about money
0/0	It's all about money. The vaccine companies making money and politicians supporting them making their money.
1/1	It's all about supply where I live. Get it moving please. Folks are ready to put shots in arms.
1/1/1	It's all in the numbers: Chances of getting severly ill from covid 19 > Having a severe reaction to the vax
0/0	It's all lies .just normal winter flu I don't need no vaccine .my immune system will protect me .
0/-1	It's all so crazy. Funny how most people still believe this charade
1/-1	It's all we have at present. No doubt future vaccines will change just as the virus changes.
0/0	It's alot to sort out for sure. I just saw 11 people were hospitalized in Denver last week after they got the JJ vaccine and were sickened
1	It's already February. First mRNA vaccinations outside a clinical trial started about 8 weeks ago (UK). Since then million of doses have been administered. Looking at data and reports of side-effects etc., I'd call it a great success.
1/1	It's already been tested on the rich and powerful who cut the line to get it and that's how you know it's safe... I would get it in a heartbeat, it makes me so frustrated to think about doses possibly going to waste.
0/0	It's amazing how a vaccine can be made in a couple of weeks for a new variant, I smell bullshit
0/0	It's amazing how fast we just accepted that kids having heart attacks is normal.
1/1	It's amazing how many people know more than scientist good luck
0/0	It's amazing how people are so willing to get something that They're unsure if it's even going to work
1/1	It's amazing how they simplify the explanation of the research about creation of the vaccine. Thanks for letting us, laymen, understand complex science stuffs.
0/0	It's an EXPERIMENT and ALL side effects from this vaccine are NOT yet known
0/0	It's an EXPERIMENT and ALL side effects from this vaccine are NOT yet known,( which could take up to 2 yrs to know) and that should have been stated in this video, not to mention the known side affects
0/0	It's an agenda. They're going to release an updated version.
0/0	It's an experimental Bio many are dying .
0/0	It's an experimental injectable clinical trial using us as guinea pigs..it is not a vaccine... the serum targets inner main organs..heart, lungs, brain...it's gene therapy.. i so wish people would research and stop believing the fear narrative. There's no contagion!!! Zero, none.. it's the flu ..influenza A and B...
0/0	It's an inadequately tested poison! No one will vaccinate me and my family members with these Satanic poisons, in shah Allah. It's a recipe for autoimmune diseases!
1/1	It's as safe as any vaccine, ever. It's already proven, and is saving literally millions of lives.
0/0	It's at month seven we will turn into zombies
0/0	It's awesome how youtube will only allow one side of this argument.
0/0	It's awful how people that are choosing to get the jab are so vocal to those of us who are choosing to not. Just wrong!!!!
0/-1	It's because it's warming up and the warm weather kills the virus just like Trump said it would!
1/1	It's been 4 days since I got my first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine, haven't had any distinct side effects but Pfizer ads keep popping up across all my socials
0/0	It's been a year already give it up. You want the Jab by all means take it. I'm good without it.
1/1	It's been a year... the Vax is safe. Grow up. Anecdotes are not evidence.
1/1	It's been over 3 weeks since my first dose and I would like to get my second dose as soon as possible
1/1	It's better that someone gets vaccinated rather than the vaccine spoil..
0/0	It's better to take chances of survival with corona than this vaccine
0/-1	It's called choice
1/1	It's comforting to know that there are so many really smart people out there working to solve hard problems like this
0/0	It's crazy how you keep saying they're safe, yet the jab is on CLINICAL TRIAL until 2030.
1/1	It's crazy the likes over-weigh the dislikes on scientific videos explaining the vaccine vs. news, and political figures.
0/0	It's dangerous as it hasn't been properly tested on humans and rushed through, also as a Christian I don't believe in putting drugs into my body
1/1	It's definitely not caused by our safe vaccines. The scientists know this much.
1/1	It's depressing how necessary this is, but here we are. Unfortunately, there are hundreds of thousands of parents that are willing to let their children die to something completely preventable.
1/1	It's difficult to have any empathy for those in the public eye, with a platform and who, for any reason are passing along DANGEROUS misinformation to the public about the pandemic, and themselves become a victim of their own misinformation. Worse yet are when those same people end up in the ICU and their family and friends start asking the public to keep that person in their thoughts and prayers. What about all the unknown people who listened to their dangerous misinformation and died because of it?
0	It's easier to fool someone than it is to convince them they have been fooled
1/1	It's every Democrat's duty to get vaccinated we will need every vote in the years ahead conversely, every Republican should refuse the fewer of them there are, the better
0/0	It's evil they only want people to take the vaccine, snuffing out all these other alternatives. The government doesn't care about people but for some reason people have a religious faith in their "leaders". This never should have happened!
0/0	It's experimental, it's not like any normal vaccine it's reasonable to be hesitant. And when you don't have transparency you wind up with conspiracies, shutting down criticism is only going to fuel the fire and make trust worse.
0/0	It's fascinating to see parents stop at WholeFoods and load up on a bunch of organic groceries after leaving their pediatrician who just injected their kids with polysorbate 80, formaldehyde, MSG, aluminum & mercury
0/0	It's funny how hard the mainstream propaganda has to work to find a single unvaccinated person who is in hospital because of Covid while burrying the 100 000s of people who died from the kill shot.
0/0	It's funny how the rationale used to explain away the deaths of those who are vaccinated was not sufficient to explain the deaths that occurred before the vaccine was issued .... every death was said to be from covid ... now it's any death of a vaccinated person is for anything but the vaccine. All of a sudden prexisting health conditions are the causes of death.. I know that you realize this inconsistency as you speak Doctor.
0/0	It's funny that every new variant is always more contagious than the last one.
1/0	It's getting more difficult to believe that the high number of #COVID_19 related deaths in #Greece is entirely attributable to a low #vaccination rate.
1/1	It's going to annoy the remain goons but the AZ Oxford vaccine will be the workhorse vaccine of the global pandemic.....
0/0	It's going to turns us all into aliennnnnnnssssssss!
1/1	It's good to see outlying countries are being vaccinated too.
1/1	It's great seeing teens going against their anti-vaxx parents to make sure that they are safe
1/1	It's great that states are taking advantage of large arenas to get a lot people vaccinated at one time.
1/1	It's great to see vaccines around now i take this opportunity to thank all the doctors who contributed in anyway to get at this point. God bless you all.
1/1	It's hard to have an intelligent and informative conversation with anti-vaxxers. It really is. Because their side is ridiculous.
1/1	It's hard to win an argument against an intelligent person but impossible to win against a dumb one
1/-1	It's hard to win an argument against an intelligent person. But it's impossible to win against a dumb person.
1/1	It's idiotic to believe that if others are vaccinated then you are protected. If you're are scared of covid-19, get the vaccine, you should be protected, even if others didn't get the vaccine. AND IF your NOT protected and you get covid after getting the vaccine, then that means the vaccine DOESN'T WORK. Makes sense to me. If you truly believe everyone needs to have it, for YOU to be safe, you're basically a DICTATOR who cares NOTHING of the population.
0/0	It's illegal. We're not animals. Don't force us to use self defense.
0/-1	It's important to be open about the information of vaccines all.
1	It's incredibly refreshing to see a comment section that is not full of anti vaxx bs . Thank yall for being sane
0/-1	It's infinitely painful to witness people's inability to think about this stuff.
1/1	It's interesting how they think it's their "right" not to take the vaccine, while at the same time arguing that others should not have the right to protect themselves from the virus. They argue against mask mandates and social distancing measures, but reject the one thing that could end these requirements.
1/1	It's interesting that RNA vaccines can just be tweaked to rapidly adjust for mutations. Thank you science
0/1/0	It's interesting that leftists say 'my body, my choice', when it comes to k!lling babies but do not say the same when mandated experimental jabs are f0rced into them.
1/1	It's interesting that they trust the doctors enough to go to the hospital to get treated but not enough to get the vaccine or even to believe that COVID exists.
1/-1	It's interesting to read the formulation of Covishield, Covaxin & Sputnik V. All different in concept & making
0/0	It's just a life-threatening Vaxxine!
1/-1/1	It's just an incentive to get the skeptics vaccinated. I feel they should have waited to say this when most of the country has already been vaccinated. Better safe than sorry. RT @aaronecarroll: But there's a small chance that you could still get infected and.... Stop. Just go get vaccinated. As fast as you can. RT @Sites4Congress: @sabrinaeaton @Jim_Jordan Jim Jordan's voted against free testing. Against free vaccinations. Against the financial r‚Ä¶ RT @aaronecarroll: But what about new variants and is it as effective against those and what about the future and... Stop. Just go get v‚Ä¶
0/1	It's just every time I see news on this progress I get very hopeful and I need to know if I need to be more realistic toward this or if this indeed is something to be excited about?
1/-1	It's just truly depressing how many people who need to see this won't, and of those that do see this how many will just ignore it.
1/1	It's kinda funny that anti-vaxxers are usually people who have limited brain power.
1/1	It's kinda sad how the countries that paid the least attention to the pandemic, downplaying and ignoring it, get the vaccines first, while the rest of the world sits and waits. Goes to show how shitty the world is
1/1	It's like a paradox. I have no issue getting a vaccine for COVID. However, government mandated vaccines (or even just marking people who have received the vaccine on their health card or whatever) screams totalitarianism. Makes me uneasy. I got COVID many weeks ago though, so it looks like I won't need one anyway since I've got all those good antibodies now. Good poll.
1/1/1/1/1	It's like being anti-surgery because there's a death rate for every operation.
1/1	It's like driving a car and NOT wearing your seatbelt. Can a seatbelt cut into your stomach or damage your neck im an accident? Ofc....but i'd rather wear it and possibly have that happen than have an accident and fly through a windscreen. Prevention is better than cure.
0/-1	It's like playing Russian roulette...NO THANK YOU!
0/-1	It's like taking candy from a stranger.
0/0	It's like you forgetting that people go retarded because of vaccination, and people dying from complications from vaccinations. How come deaths matter only when it suits you?
1/1	It's mid March and finally decided to take it. Your video answered every question I had, I'm extremely grateful. 60yr. old and not in the best of health, but moving forward with vaccine and hoping for the best.... God bless.
0/0	It's more a question of knowing too much about corruption at government and big pharma level
0/0	It's more benficial to keep you sick and alive, than cure you. I won't buy their game
0/0	It's more like the vaccine give you PERMANENT illnesses and leads you to death.
1/1	It's more safe than almost every other drug we have in the market. If you don't consider this safe then basically you can't use all of the other medication we have on the market.
0/0	It's my body I have full right to say no vaccine
0/0	It's my choice and I just decided not to get it. vacc is suspicious.
1/-1	It's not "plans" when it happens months too late; it's just finally doing something you already should've done -- if necessary, by pressuring Tr*mp's government to help.
1/1	It's not 100% success but let us hope and pray for good results
0/0	It's not Vaccine hesitancy. They are labeling it incorrectly. It's literally government distrust
1/1	It's not a legitimate point of view, it's morons spreading harmful lies.
0/0	It's not a vaccine and you know it. So why lie? It's an experiment using genetic manipulation that has never been proved effective. All the animals tested died when they were infected with a real corona virus. Animal abuse is also unethical.
0/-1	It's not a vaccine if it doesn't stop transmission or infection. It's not registered as a vaccine its gene therapy.Controllavirus.
0/0	It's not a vaccine is it? A gene-editing nano biotech injection would be a more accurate description.
0/0	It's not a vaccine it's an e xperimental biological mRNA gene therapy that will alter you, wake up people !!!!
0/0	It's not a vaccine! It's an experiment with no legal consequences.
0	It's not a vaccine, it's a treatment
0/0/0/0/0	It's not a vaccine, it's an experimental medical trial in its final phase. This is dangerous disinformation which would get thrown out in a court of law. "Stay safe" yourself matey!
0/0	It's not a vaccine, it's experimental gene therapy.
0/0	It's not a vaccine, it's gene therapy, per their patents?
0/0/0	It's not a vaccine, its a planet wide experimental treatment. Just because you change the definitions doesn't make it true. Microchip- ..... Change genetics.....it does (temporarily?) hijack your cellular machinery to replicate 30k-50k human sample size which only is few months old does not equal safety for whole planet ya rhetards Last mrna trial on rats killed them all due to immunization priming. Longterm side effects of experimental crap vs 99.99% - 97%. Not hard to choose. Sars2 has yet to be proven to exist. PHUCK THE COLLECTIVE. You are no real doctor.
0/0	It's not a vaccine. It cannot be mandated. The immune system is more effective than any vaccine.. with no side effects. Healthy people are healthy people. They need no treatment. And get a better test as the PCR is not a valid diagnostic tool, according to the man who created it.
0/0	It's not a vaccine. It's gene manipulation therapy. Remember what happened when monsanto gmo'd corn?
0/0	It's not a vaccine. Its a trial on gene therapy and you all are the lab rats.
0/0	It's not a vaccine...it's a human clinical drug trial and you are guinea pigs. Once you've had it you might be lucky enough to have no side effects however most people have and sadly some have died. This doesn't stop you from getting covid at all. It's a DNA changer. Folks you are being duped into thinking you are doing a kind gesture to save you and your family.
0/0	It's not about a 'virus'! It's about control!
1/-1	It's not about a different point of view. It's about facts and lies.
1/1	It's not about completely preventing it. It's about reducing the impact. Even if you're unlucky enough to still catch it with the vaccine, you almost certainly won't require hospitalization.
1/1	It's not about freedom, it's simply respect for others. If you don't care about getting sick, that's fine, just don't put other people at risk.
0/-1	It's not about keeping us safe It's about control.
0/0	It's not agreeing to vaccine, it's agreeing to "die"!
0/0	It's not anti vax, it is pro freedom which the jab seems to be ignoring
1/-1	It's not easy to have a fact-based discussion with people driven by fear.
0/0	It's not even a vaccine, it's an experimental vaccine and human being are officially a lab Rats.
0/-1	It's not even a vaccine, it's gene therapy.
1/1	It's not even approved for daily use it's just emergency use only, nobody is forcing your lazy a** to get up to go to a hospital to help everyone out
1/0	It's not going to re-write my DNA and make me into a chimera? Darn, I wanted to become a centaur! X-D
0/-1	It's not just about trusting the government, it's the media as well. If news outlets would report the news, instead of giving us their take on it, that would greatly help.
0/0	It's not just this one death. Read the comments. There are others who have died from a recent vaccine.
1	It's not longer "experimental" it's more of an actual medication now. My friend got his vaccines and nothing has happened at all. My teachers have also gotten theirs and again nothing has happened.
0/0	It's not safe and you know it. My body my choice.
0/0	It's not safe exactly! It's still expiremental vaccine
0/0	It's not safe for adult, why would it be safe for <5 yr?
0/0	It's not safe they haven't even researched the vaccine for side effects and there is a small chance you will die from the vaccine straight away what's the point of taking a placebo it doesn't even stop you from catching it the vaccine was supposed to be for the weak and people with no immune system let's see all the politicians take it on air and prove they are actually taking it
0/0	It's not safe. You can get and transmit "Covid" even if you're vaccinated twice. Now go on and spread your germs. When the fifth wave comes and they ask for more doses, I hope to God y'all will wake up.
0/0	It's not stopping people catching or spreading it, so think IL pass
1/1	It's not surprising. There is hardly any other advocacy group as easily agitated as the antivaxxers. Just tweet a provaccine message and a barrage of angry responses arrives instantaneously.
0/0	It's not that effective.... At least, latest data shows.
0/0	It's not that we don't need a vaccine (we have an immune system ......hello) we SHOULDN'T BE TAKING VACCINES PERIOD !!!
1/0	It's not the deaths in those ages that are the problem. It's the 400,000+ people spreading a virus with an R0 of 7+.
0/-1	It's not the needle it's freedom of choice. No one has the right to force you to inject something into your body. They're using this plandemic as the great reset which will result in vaccine passports and central bank backed digital currency in which you can kiss many of your freedoms goodbye. Oh and wait for the nationwidw Internet outage cause that's next.
0/0	It's not the vacine I'm worried about it's the government I dont trust
1/1	It's not up to the individuals cause almost all of them have no expertise in that subject and they make bad decisions. Which is why we have scientists. The vaccine significantly decreases death and hospitalisations. Isn't that a good thing?
0/0	It's now worked its way through a substantial amount of the "vaccinated."
0/0	It's official a friend of mine sister took the injection 2 weeks ago now she's dead note she was in perfect health and pressured into it by her job she leaves behind three beautiful children and a loving husband
1/1	It's official! I'm officially fully vaccinated! It feels great to be part of the solution instead of part of the problem.
0/0	It's ok to want autonomy over your own body. That isn't a conspiracy.
1/1	It's one small step for us but a giant leap for Nigeria and the world. Get vaccinated today. Let's keep the game on.
1/1	It's only fair to give the extra vaccine doses to other countries who really need them.
0/-1	It's people's right to refuse something they are not sure about.
0/0	It's perfectly safe!..........Famous last words of EVERYONE on the Titanic also!
0/0	It's poison. Wake up America. I don't get any vaccinations and neither do my kids and we're are fine. They put stuff that kills you slowly
0/0	It's pretty common now. I just found out about a whole dinner table of vaccinated people who are now infected in my area.
1/1	It's pretty fucking good, it means that hospitals will no longer be swamped with covid cases and barely anyone will be dying, so we can go back to our normal lives
1/1	It's pretty simple, get vaccinated and boosted and wear a mask when you're out in public.
0/-1	It's quite unfortunate that people will get the covid jab every year ,from pandemic to ENDEMIC
1/1	It's really dumb when people do "oh well I won't take vaccines, there is a chance that it could hurt my child" and then they give their child medicine that has the same chances for bad reactions, and bad side effects.
0/0	It's really harmful ecause it's not natural , it kills human
1/1	It's really nice of them to do this the vaccine is free of charge
1/-1	It's really stupid to not ask the nurse about the details of the adverse reactions she's seen. It's such a mistake to not go into this in detail, since it seems to be stopping a lot of people from getting the vaccine.
0/0	It's ridiculous that ANYONE is considering putting an "experimental"(legally classified) vaccine to a virus that is a bio-weaponized viral hybrid.This was created in a lab, and as the probe goes deeper into the situation it turns out that words were replaced and redefined in order that the denial could be without perjury.
0/0	It's risky and yet mandated to make it worse
0/0	It's sad I watched the movie and I can't trust anything the CDC says anymore.
1/1	It's sad to see some people believe that vaccines don't work
1/1	It's sad to see the other side of the coin with this issue. It's also sad that the least well informed as also in many cases, the ones who are least equipped financially to cope (in the US at least). In the countries where my family live (Australia and Japan), we're seeing the reverse. We have very high uptakes of the vaccine (currently around the 95% of all over 16 years old). Cases are coming back down, hospital rates are plummeting and life is getting back to normal. Hospitals are getting free ICU beds and resources are there to do elective surgery. The public is more confident to see their doctors and enter emergency rooms for other types of emergencies. Something as simple are regular check ups allowing for the detection of cancers for example, is now starting to occur at regular levels. The vaccine is really the solution to the problem. What might feel like a rushed, untested, experimental vaccine to some in this video is possibly borne out of not understand the processes required. With global research bringing together decades or work, short cutting of the bureaucratic portions of testing and overlapping of phases of testing, this vaccine has been fortunate to have an accelerated path through a normal but just as thorough testing regime. In light of new variants such as Delta and now Omicron, it's certainly better to provide our immune systems some preparatory immunity than to be open to natural attack in the hope that one can recover naturally - as we have seen, exposing oneself to this beast of a virus.
1/1	It's safe and it's the only way to stop covid.
0/0/0	It's safe as long as you can't sue them.
1/1	It's safe for you to be vaccinated if you're trying to conceive or would like to have a child in the future. No evidence exists to suggest that Covid vaccines cause fertility problems.
0/0	It's safe not to get it
0/0	It's scary that we are putting vaccine in so many people when it was developed so recently and we don't know what the long-term implications are.
1/0	It's selfish not to get vaccinated, putting your health and others at risk..wasting the resources of the health care system when it can be easily prevented. You don't trust the vaccine? You are so ignorant..open your eyes seriously, 4 million vaccinated people in my country and 2 have died from vaccine complications, keep in mind they had underlying health problems
0/0	It's so deadly you have to get tested to know you have it
1/1	It's so easy to argue against antivax, they are just dumb
1/-1	It's so easy to forget how incredibly smart humanity is until you get reminded of it by such great feats of technology, innovaton, and science.
0/0	It's so effective that it didn't even have to be approved...
0/0	It's so good to see that people are waking up to all this bullshit. It's reassuring to see so many people questioning more. I'm 21 weeks pregnant and left the care of my first midwife when she tried to pressure me to get vaccinated and started treating me differently when I refused because I trusted my natural immunity more than the pharmaceutical companies and didn't think I was at risk. Found a much better midwife that actually mentioned the increase of stillborns among vaccinated and isn't pressuring me to take the jab. Seems much more trustworthy. I also am pretty sure I had COVID at the start of January and it was not a big deal. The week long headache was the worst part but that might be because I didn't want to take anything for it. Now baby and I are doing just fine. So glad I knew better than to listen to the first midwife.
1/-1	It's so sad to see how little people understand about vaccines
0/0	It's so safe that all these companies have 100% indemnity so we're supposed to trust their product more than them? If nobody complied they'd actually have to relinquish their indemnity, bunch of overly compliant serfs, I stand on principle alone, not taking something from someone who has zero liability - shove it!
0/0	It's so safe, so safe, so safe, that thousands of people are dead and tens of thousands have permanent injury.
0/0	It's still experimental..they don't know this positivity.
0/0	It's strange that they used different demographics in the study ie only people who take flu shots (presumably: at risk/frail people) in the control vs general population in the vaccine group. Maybe that's why they find those surprising outcomes?
1/1	It's stupid conspiracy theorists that are resisting it so the government has no choice but to persuade them to
0/0	It's stupid to me. I have 3 family members who tested positive after getting vaccinated. So what difference does it make?
0/0	It's such a relief knowing that I won't have to worry about any of this either in the short-term or long-term because I am not taking any of this poison
0/0	It's takes 12 years on average for full approval, ya know because that's the only way you test the LONG TERM side affects!
0/0	It's the beginning of the end of Freedom . Screw the vaccine .
1/1	It's the beginning of the end, boys! I know this might've been said tens of thousands of times but for a pandemic virus we knew nothing about in January, a working vaccine being shipped 11 months later is a truly extraordinary feat.
1/-1	It's the being 12 months into a pandemic and still having people who refuse to wear a mask to protect their/others' lives for me.
1/1	It's the best thing ever happening to me!
0/0	It's the long-term (unknown) side effects that concern me the most, vaccine long term effects will destroy us.
0/0/0/0	It's the long-term (unknown) side effects that concern me the most.
0/0	It's the only vaccine I know of, where once you've had it, you still have to social distance, wear a mask or two, depending on when and who's "science" you must follow, and has had no time to have long time clinical trials to see if side effects surface years down the line!! I'm not letting foreign RNA into my body, just to trigger a defensive response from my DNA, just cos flip flop Fauci says so one month, and then changes his tune the next. No thank you. I'll be responsible, social distance and wear a mask, but come near with a needle, and I won't put up with that, not till five years atleast, when unknown side effects start to surface.
1/1	It's the only way it will one day disappear this virus once and for all, so let's all get ready and get vaccinated!!
0/0/0	It's the vaccine. So many people are dying & most have bad side affects (sic). Its (sic) a man made (sic) virus & all involved including the WHO UN WEF should all be charged with genocide
1/1	It's time to either mandate vaccines nation wide or impose harsh tax penalties on those who are not vaccinated. If we could impose tax penalties on people who didn't have health insurance, idk why we can't do the same to people who aren't vaccinated.
0/-1	It's time to rise up. We are the people. We need to take control of the rich and elite and make this world better for everyone.
0/-1	It's time to stand up for what we believe in and fight for our freedom. Where are all the freedom fighters. !?
0/0	It's to late for the vaxed they made their choice unvaxed stay strong.
1/1	It's totally safe to take the vaccine though guys.
0/0	It's true that there isn't evidence of a pandemic.
1/1	It's true the vaccines being produced against coronavirus were created in record time, but that's not because they were rushed. It's because of careful preparation. The technology that underlies both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines has been in the works for more than a decade and was made precisely for a pandemic situation. The pandemic is an emergency situation which required emergency response but that does not mean the companies bypassed safety protocols or performed inadequate testing. In addition to the safety review by the FDA, the Advisory Committee on Immunization has convened a panel of vaccine safety experts to independently evaluate the safety data from the clinical trial. The safety of COVID-19 vaccine will continue to be closely monitored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the FDA, so overall, you should definitely get the vaccine as soon as possible because it is SAFE and much more beneficial for your health.
0/-1	It's truly amazing to me how many people are willingly going to lineup to get the equivalent of a blue tattoo.
0/0	It's truly corporate greed, why they didn't do buisnesses in another way instead of enforce employees to get vaccine
0/-1	It's unbelievable that you have to justify yourself. I am also vaccinated but I find it embarrassing how they deal with unvaccinated ones.
1/1	It's unbelivable how they think they are more smart, how they think they are special cause they feel they know something that others don't, they feel some kinda of superiority, like they understand more than the specilists and cientists.
1/1	It's unfathomable that people are STILL walking around unvaccinated!!!! I keep making comments in the hopes that my words can help someone. If I can help just one person, that's one more person that can possibly be saved.
1/1	It's useless trying to talk rationally with these anti-vaxxers. They're in their own paranoid world where imaginary evil powers are conniving to harm us all and any proof brought against their theories is considered evidence of just how insidious these evil powers are.
0/0	It's very comforting to read the comments, and see the resistance!
1/1	It's very comforting to see that the vaccines are still very highly protective.
1/1	It's very frustrating to read all the anti vaccine comments all over the internet. Even here in Switzerland, where we supposedly have very good general education there's an alarming rise of people spreading misinformation.
1/1	It's very hard to get an appointment right now. Guess I'll have to wait...
0/0	It's very hard to hear him say how incredibly safe this vaccine is when I know so many people who have suffered terrible side effects and in hindsight wish they had never had the vaccine üôà
1/1	It's very strange to find that many of the same people who promoted "herd immunity" when it meant killing hundreds of thousands of people by leaving the virus free to rip through the population are now dead set against herd immunity done properly with a vaccine which could save tens of thousands of lives.
0/0	It's well known in medical circles the vaccine makes your immune system weaker! Don't take it Never had it never will bc I don't get fearful; I trust in my Lord and savior Jesus Christ
0/0	It's wierd how inconsistent this is with getting infected with other viruses. But covid you should get vaccinated everytime a new version is created. Screw that. If I die then I die but I'm totally against the vaccine, people still catch it.
1/1	It's worth noting, preventing infections is still kind of a goal. Obviously preventing hospitalizations frees up ICU beds for unvaccinated or unvaccinatable people, but preventing infections is vital to promoting herd immunity, which is a desirable outcome. That said, any vaccine is far better than no vaccine.
1/1	It's your choice of course, but only the vaccine will allow you to return to a normal(ish) life. All the supplements in the world won't stop some illnesses getting through.
0/0	Italy are going to jail bill gates I hope once this starts they all get jailed and forced to have the death jab
1/1	Italy should ban antivaxx parents from work. poor kids always on the shitty end. no vaccines, no health care, everybody looks at you funny, and now you can't get an education because your parents are dumb as rocks.
0/0	Italy's doctors (most of them) refused to vaccinate..
1/1/1	Its 100% safe
0/0	Its BILL GATES money vaccine! RIP
0/0	Its NOT A VACCINE, this is pure guilt tripping propaganda, this has passed NO SAFETY TESTS, and is still in the stage 3 trials which don't end until 2023, then there's stage four ü§∑‚ôÇÔ∏è, and they completely missed out the animal testing. YOU ARE THE ANIMAL TEST SUBJECTS!!
0/0	Its The vaccine which is causing everyone to get sick. Mark my words !!!
0/0	Its a NO from me
1/1	Its a good job we all don‚Äôt think like you or some of the deadliest diseases would still be around so many to name it would take me to long to list them all
1/0	Its a human right to reject any form of foreign body been injected into your arm. I'm pro vaccine but I respect people's opinions and choices because.... aren't we free ?
1/1	Its a very safe vaccine. There is miniscule risk of death with the vaccine. If you catch covid your chances of death are about 10, 000 times higher than if you have the vaccine. Your choice.i want the vaccine..(well I have already had it !) And there is always long covid waiting to destroy the lives of those that catch and survive the virus. Vaccines protect against that too
0/0	Its about time we've had to opportunity to hear from some of the people who refuse to vaccinate. Now interview some other doctors in the state and others countries that disagree with the vaccine, that would be great üëç
0/0	Its all a government population control system. This fake ass vaccine is a way for the government to track people
1/1	Its all about herd immunity.
1/-1	Its all about time, that's definitely plays a roll here, think & stay positive keep you're faith & Hope Alive, if people just do their part right now. . that is continue to wearing you'reüò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑ very too early to make sure we're gonna all be back to life/ reality, normal daily activities of living healthy without the covid-19 forget we are what we eat to, eat healthy, exercise,
0/0	Its almost like the "vaccine" was pushed way too quickly without enough testing?
1/1	Its almost like vaccines work!
1/-1	Its also not like they can manufacture all the vaccines at once, so why would I want to be the first to get it when I'm in the lowest risk group. Way rather wait for later batches and get the added bonus of seeing any potential side effects.
1	Its amazing how the politicians are vaccinated and keep telling the people they don't have to be vaccinated.
0/0	Its an experimental vaccine, the long and medium term risks are unknown, according to Fauci, once you take the vaccine, you immediately need to mask up, social distance, and avoid crowds, to protect you from a virus with a 99+% recovery rate, doesn‚Äôt really seem like a compelling reason to take the jab. I will gladly contribute my place in line to someone who may actually need the vaccine (some one in a high risk category with several comorbidities for example).
0/0	Its banned not approved by FDA, USA and many European countries. Not sure how much company paying Dr. Tam her team and other PR Doc.
0/0	Its based on individual choice. I'm not taking it either...nor are anyone I know and love. And no amount of shaming or explanations will change that. And for the record ...all i know have Masters degrees. Again its based on individual choice.
1/1	Its been clear for a while it works and will help us out of the pandemic... Not sure why some many countries have concerns - its simple get on and vaccinate - save your health systems and lives.. Nobody knows what will happen tomorrow - could get sick/die from anything - rather have the vaccine and hope can have some form of life again...
0/0	Its been over 30 years since I have been sick...,last time was rigth after I took a recommended vaccine...never again, I like staying healthy!
0/0	Its been proven that the first round or so of a vaccine has a higher risk of major complications due to lack of knowledge of the side effects. And these being pushed out so quickly with very little testing is scary. No telling what the long term effects of a rushed vaccine will be
0/0	Its crazy how so many "experts" and "doctors" are on board pushing these vaccines and mandates thinking it is what will save your life.
0/0/0	Its definitely a no for me.
0/0/0/0/0/0	Its different this time. I'm with the antivaxxers!!!
1/1/1	Its fine, let those anti vaxxers catch the whooping cough and see how they like it lol
0/-1	Its funny how its because of an underlying problem "but" would have never happened if he had not taken vaccine
1/1	Its funny how people with no knowledge about biology tries to say why you shouldn't take the vaccine
0/0	Its gene therapy, not a vaccine
0/0	Its going to happen dude there going to turn humanity into cyborgs avoid the vax and microchips dude.
1/1/1/1	Its gonna be great watching the graphs of continued infections and when the vaccine hits seeing those rates start to fall. Then the real fun will start with the anti vaxxers doing everything they can to explain away why rates start to fall as soon as the vaxx hits.
1	Its good that sputnik v uses different vectors but the protein produced will be same (spike proteins). So will the antibodies already present in the body due to first dose not attack the second virus again. This can reduce the efficacy.
1/1	Its important to note that 1 in 25000 will still lead to alot of death counts but its STILL safer than covid wich has a 3 in 100 death rate. Dont get discouraged by deaths due to vaccines as they are literally miniscule compared to pandemic threat right now.
1/1	Its like my first time seeing people be more afraid of the vaccine than the actual virus
0/0	Its like people don;t understand that a corona virus is highly mutative, and none of the vaccines will even matter in a few months.
0/-1	Its mark of the beast now in play...thank u america..lord please take care of all the believers and get the ones that dont believe to believe
1/1	Its mind boggling to see how far we have come in terms of science, technology and medical field.
0/0/0/0	Its never been a "vaccine", it's genetic engineering.
1/1	Its nice knowing how close we are to defeating this pandemic! :)
0/-1	Its not about a virus and the sooner people realise that the better but sadly most of the population is still brainwashed and paralyzed with fear. I see them in the shops with their little masks and want to shake them to wake up
1/-1	Its not correct- the Russian Sputnik V contains no Covid19Virus parts but is on the basis of the human adenovirus...So its acceptable and possible w/o ingeneered mRNA
0/0	Its not just a vaccine, next comes your health passport. Then yearly vaccines to keep your health passport valid and to keep up with changing strains. Then it will be drugs to combat the conditions caused by the vaccines. Then more drugs to combat the side effects of the other drugs. Follow the money trail.
1/-1	Its not painless getting the vaccine it just painful trying to get an appointment to get the vaccine. Its horrible that we have to almost beg to get it. Been trying with no luck.
1/1	Its not that bad. Just got my second shot. I had fever, chills, and aches for 24 hours. Then felt better
0/0	Its ok to kill people with vaccine... Its totally ok !!! We wont tell you what are the long term sideeffect....!!
0/0	Its predicted, once d vaccine is in d market China will come out with a vaccine
1/1	Its really reassuring that all of the vaccines work and are effective!
1/1	Its sad how vaccines have done such a good job of protecting people from deadly diseases worldwide that people have actually been led to believe these diseases are actually harmless. Vaccines cause anti-vaxxers.
1/-1	Its sad this needs to be stated, but thank you for informing people about the facts.
1/1	Its simple we remove the anti vaccination people from the gene pool then they can't water it down with their stupidity
1/0	Its so funny how quickly covid is disappearing because of sheep waking up..
1/1	Its so hard to choose between a 3% chance of death and a 0.0001% chance of death
0/0	Its so rare, it keeps happening, I'm good with my natural immunity, Thanks
0/-1	Its so sad that people in the so-called developed world leave their patents and grand patents in elderly facilities and let the government just get rid of them
0/0	Its that same people calling everybody Nazis yet demanding that we all carry our "papers".
0/0	Its the lies by media which cause outrage . The vaccine cures nothing . They say it simply prevents hospitL requirements. Don't say conspiracy theorists A LARGE number of VIRAL EXPERTS SAY and up until 2020 insisted lockdowns always helped the spread . Mask wearing helped the spread . BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY if loom at death breakdowns . Percentage wise UK has less deaths this year than a lot of previous last 20 years . Why was a meeting held 3 months before first vivid case to dis uss vaccine . Why was WHO exec in wuhan describing in Nov 19 how they were actually working on civid new strains then wrote a report for fauchi and WHO stating was a conspiracy theory . Then the actually tape of him that was released on YouTube before first case was discovered turned up this month . So was fact not conspiracy bill Gates talking of covid 21 in Feb this year on American TV due to new strain wtf then Hungary who have vaccinated thd highest percentage of population are now in the midst of worse death amounts since( outbreak) began why is common sense far from common why bother with vaccine when apparently new strains keep turning up . Its a joke
0/0	Its the metals theyre putting in the vaccines that are killing people.
0/0	Its the natural infection that's going to end the pandemic and not the vaccine... already over 60% population have natural immunity across some countries and approaching herd immunity via natural infections... but the credit will go to the vaccine...
1/0	Its tragic she speaks for so many like her who a pro vaccine.
1/1	It‚Äôll end when these JackA$$$ would get vaccinated and wear there mask ü§¶üèΩ‚ôÇÔ∏è
1/1	It‚Äôs 95% effective, so there is still a small possibility that you get the coronavirus and spread it to others. What really is important is that once you take the vaccine, it‚Äôs pretty much impossible for you to die from the virus (it will never get severe). So in essence, you are well protected even if u do get sick.
0/0	It‚Äôs Gene Therapy. ‚ÄòVax‚Äô was all false branding
0/0	It‚Äôs Not A Booster It‚Äôs The 4th Shot Of A Product That Already Failed Three Times
0/0	It‚Äôs So Unbelievable how people believe these devils telling you that THE POISON they are injecting in you is a vaccine.
1	It‚Äôs a beautiful day for a second dose! #vaccinated #Grateful
0/0	It‚Äôs a bigger warning the vaccines are not vaccines they are a money making scam
1/1/1/1	It‚Äôs a clear choice ......catch Covid and you could actually die or get vaccinated and their is an extremely rare chance of a side effect leading to death. The world is filling up with WOKE pussy‚Äôs suffering from breast milk withdrawal symptoms!
1/1	It‚Äôs a difficult debate. I have gotten vaccinated, all my loved ones have been vaccinated, I do think it‚Äôs a good idea to get a vaccine. God knows everyone is tired of the Pandemic. People should have a right to choose but at the same time, people should have a right to go to a restaurant, Doctors office, grocery store, gas station‚Ä¶ where employees are not as likely to get them sick, meaning those who choose not to get a vaccine. If everyone, vaccinated and unvaccinated, did there part to avoid crowds, practice social distancing, wearing a mask and getting tested regularly, I think it would help get the Pandemic under control.
1	It‚Äôs a good day. 1st shot for my dad who turns 80 in just a few weeks. Feeling so damn grateful for science
1/1	It‚Äôs a great idea to urge to get vaccinated against COVID-19. That‚Äôs the only way to return to normality.
0/0	It‚Äôs a novel MOA and a rushed vaccine. We‚Äôve also been lied to multiple times about covid with the WHO, Fauchi and the media. No one has any business forcing someone to get a vaccine like this. I‚Äôm going to wait for the studies and additional data around the vaccine before getting it
1/-1/1	It‚Äôs a pandemic we need to be vaccinating poorer countries
1/0	It‚Äôs a physicians legal job to encourage ppl to get vaccinated. Doesn‚Äôt mean he actually got vaccinated...there are so many ppl lying about receiving the vaccine.
0/0	It‚Äôs a scientific breakthrough and if the test results hold up in a large population, will be the dawn of a new age of vaccine manufacture and research.
0/0	It‚Äôs a shame they lying about those stupid vaccines that don‚Äôt work because to many people keep getting the virus after getting the vaccines and dying and having health problems and blood clots
1	It‚Äôs a societal duty and an obvious personal choice for self-defence. To not take it is nihilism at best and psychopathy at worst.
1/1	It‚Äôs a virus. So it‚Äôs like a flu shot. no1 complains about those. just take the vaccine ppl!
1/1	It‚Äôs about protecting people that can‚Äôt take the vaccine.
1/1	It‚Äôs absolutely fine to ask questions about #CovidVaccine . It‚Äôs absolutely fine to be hesitant about it and seek out more information. But actively promoting & disseminating COVID vaccine misinformation is not fine. Misinformation can kill.
1/1	It‚Äôs actually unconscionable to NOT get vaccinated. IMO, professional malpractice.
0/0	It‚Äôs all about the money. No reason at all to vaccinate
1/1	It‚Äôs all about weighing risk and benefit. Right now, the risk of serious COVID-19 infection = significantly worse than the risk of major vaccine side effects. Please accept the first #CovidVaccine you are offered!
0/0	It‚Äôs all lies. This figures are all in accurate. Medical workers are for bidden to list the side effects from these vaccinations.
0/0	It‚Äôs all ready caused deaths weeks after being injected with that poison.
0/0	It‚Äôs amazing 100k people have potentially died from the Covid vaccine and they just keep giving it out.
0/0	It‚Äôs amazing how fast the vaccine came out. Other vaccines take YEARS before the are passed by the FDA. The virus was altered to what it is now and has mutated at least once. The vaccine will not do anything for you. But you will not see these results in the MSM.
1/1	It‚Äôs amazing how fast this got approved versus other vaccines. We need it
1/1	It‚Äôs amazing isn‚Äôt it how happy it makes you feel. Both my parents got vaccinated yesterday
0/0	It‚Äôs amazing that for a experimental vaccine, never used before, Pfizer knows every possible side effect (and death is not one of them)
1/-1	It‚Äôs amazing what can be done when they actually ‚Äúthrow money at it‚Äù imagine what they can accomplish if they did this with everything instead of trying to gain money to be rich
1/1	It‚Äôs amazing what engineering and science is capable of these days. Hats off to everyone who probably worked 24/7 on the development and manufacturing of this vaccine.
1/1/1/1/1	It‚Äôs amazing, and should be something we are all excited about. A HUGE advancement in the medical field and will change the future of vaccines. It‚Äôs a shame partisanship and drama is putting a damper on that.
0/0	It‚Äôs an experiment on gullible humans
0/0	It‚Äôs an experiment! Thank Bill Gates! Think Eugenics! Think Vaccines!
0/0	It‚Äôs an experimental treatment. People will get sick and some will die, as YOU are the experiment.
0/0	It‚Äôs as effective as a diet...
0/-1	It‚Äôs as if were forming a cinematic universe for vaccines.
1/0	It‚Äôs bad enough him and his oppos talking out of their ****s to the detriment of their citizens but the ongoing issue of confidence in what has now been proven to be an effective vaccine will no doubt have a fatal knock on effect. Shameful excuses for leaders.
1/1	It‚Äôs because of #Republicans like this POS that #covid is still running rampant. Wear a mask, get vaccinated, and watch how fast our hospitals empty out and our country really can move on without Covid restrictions.
1/1	It‚Äôs been thoroughly tested. But even if it is less effective/safe than advertised, it‚Äôs still gotta be better than the alternative.
0/0	It‚Äôs better getting Covid
1/1	It‚Äôs better than nothing. I would take it if it was my only choice.
1/1/1/1	It‚Äôs breaking my heart, my autistic 9 year old just wants to go play basketball with his friend down the road, and I can‚Äôt risk letting him (his mother and I have weak lungs). We need these vaccines so bad....
0/0	It‚Äôs causing heart problems and blood clots in people, young and old. I wish I never got the booster.
1/1	It‚Äôs cool because when I had my 2nd dose I didn‚Äôt feel anything it really helped my immune system good
0/0	It‚Äôs disgusting that these companies are protected from being pursued for any wrongdoing. There‚Äôs no justice in this world. I wouldn‚Äôt touch big pharma‚Äôs vaccine with a ten foot pole.
0/0	It‚Äôs experimental gene therapy. Not a vaccine.
0	It‚Äôs fascinating how folks are masking up these kids and wanting to vaccinate them, essentially teaching them to live in fear of a risk of essentially zero. This generation of kids will keep therapists busy for decades.
1/1	It‚Äôs funny how anti vax moms think they are smarter than the doctors who‚Äôve had years of training where the moms probably had 5 minutes of ‚Äúresearch‚Äù
1/1	It‚Äôs funny most people took so many drugs when they were younger and now they are worried about what‚Äôs in the vaccine
0/0	It‚Äôs garbage. A scam for the taxpayer. It causes paralyzation and gonnorhea.
0/0	It‚Äôs going backfire this sinister reset in cabal faces
0/0	It‚Äôs gonna be like I am Legend we‚Äôre all going to turn into vampires
1/1	It‚Äôs gonna suck if we‚Äôre still on lockdown in a year, because people refuse to get it. Its the only way out of this.
1/0	It‚Äôs hilarious how people think a couple shots is such a hardship
1/-1	It‚Äôs honestly sad just looking at how many people think they‚Äôre smarter than doctors, just because they looked at the internet for 10 minutes. Seriously, Antivaxxers have a pretty similar mindset to Flat earthers.
1/1	It‚Äôs honestly so nice that Dr. Mike is ACTUALLY trying to help these anti-vaxxers stop being so stupid. They aren‚Äôt bad people necessarily, my mom is one. I love her a lot, but, she needs to stop wearing a tinfoil hat and wake up.
1/1	It‚Äôs important that vaccines are delivered to countries with low vaccination records urgently, together with the means to get those vaccines into the arms of health care workers and the most vulnerable. Sending leftover doses to other countries can lead to wastage, and isn‚Äôt targeting the areas of need.
1/1	It‚Äôs important to stop and acknowledge moments that matter. The US EUA filling for our #COVID19vaccine is an exciting milestone for Novavax and for me as an employee. Here‚Äôs to a promising, healthier future for all.
1/1	It‚Äôs incredible to go from ‚Äúworst infection day‚Äù to ‚Äúhighest vaccinated in a day‚Äù in the same week.
1/1	It‚Äôs ironic that the people who are afraid of a vaccine, something that saves lives, are often the same ones claiming that they‚Äôre not at all afraid of assault rifles and other firearms, things that snuff out and destroy lives.
1/1	It‚Äôs irresponsible not too
1/1	It‚Äôs just a little weird how many anti-vaxxers swap sides when they‚Äôre in hospital dying of this non-pandemic virus
1/-1	It‚Äôs just a vaccine tho it has nothing to do about politics
1/1	It‚Äôs just that simple people. Get the vaccine and let‚Äôs end this thing.
1/1	It‚Äôs just utterly awesome that in just one year there are already many vaccines available. A huge triumph of science!!! And I also want to thank dr Campbell whose videos I have been watching, every day, since February 2020.
1/1/1	It‚Äôs kind of amazing how much misinformation and fear mongering surrounds this vaccine. Seriously, this is all stuff you learn in a high school biology class.
1/1	It‚Äôs mRNA, not a small dose of COVID - The vaccine is basically sending a messenger to tell your body to produce proteins that will destroy COVID-19 as the virus tries to enter your body.
0/0	It‚Äôs my god given right not to get the vaccine. SO GET THE FUCK OVER IT . By the way my husband got covid from someone that had been vaccinated.
1/-1	It‚Äôs never gonna stop, people poisoning other people‚Äôs minds, sickos!!!!
1/1	It‚Äôs never too late to get vaccinated. The NHS is always ready for you to come forward and get your first, second or booster jab.
1/1	It‚Äôs never too late to get your 1st dose to protect yourself and your community
0/-1	It‚Äôs not a matter of the covid vaccine being fine, or it being a conspiracy theory. It should be our choice. The government has taken your responsibility for your health. Now your health is the state‚Äôs responsibility
0/0	It‚Äôs not a vaccine at all, it‚Äôs a dangerous experimental gene therapy
0/0	It‚Äôs not a vaccine it‚Äôs a cash/power grab. Restructured of society.
0	It‚Äôs not a vaccine it‚Äôs an experimental gene therapy, it doesn‚Äôt provide immunity nor does it prevent transmission. If there‚Äôs risk there must be choice.
0/0	It‚Äôs not a vaccine it‚Äôs an experimental treatment
0/0	It‚Äôs not a vaccine, vaccines give you life long immunity. It‚Äôs a prophylactic therapeutic at best.
0/0	It‚Äôs not a vaccine. It‚Äôs an experimental pathogenic priming program.
1/1	It‚Äôs not about doing it for your country. It‚Äôs about doing it for your family and to get things back to normal.
0	It‚Äôs not anti vaccines it‚Äôs that we have woke the hell up to your plans
1/1	It‚Äôs not bad for the country. Childish behaviour and refusing to get a safe and effective vaccine bc you watched a YouTube video and listened to a meathead‚Äôs podcast, is bad for the country.
1/1	It‚Äôs not bad, got a lot of chills,
1/1	It‚Äôs not difficult to work this out pal. In every age/ risk category you are safer with the vaccine than without
1/1	It‚Äôs not freedom of speech to say the public‚Äôs confidence in the Covid vaccine is ‚Äúmass psychosis‚Äù. That‚Äôs anti-science cult propaganda.
0/0	It‚Äôs not rare! My friend had 2 strokes 30days after this jab. He nearly died. Going through physiotherapy for 4months and only 60% recovered. Couldn‚Äôt talk, walk, eat or do anything. Stay away from it!
1/1	It‚Äôs not really a mater of belief for me‚Ä¶ I am fully vaccinated. They work. They are safe, and they save lives. Get vaccinated.
0/0	It‚Äôs not safe for anyone
1/1	It‚Äôs not the spread that‚Äôs the main concern. It‚Äôs the chances of serious illness, hospitalization, ICU need and death. All those are massively reduced with the vaccine especially with a booster. Best for your own health and your loved ones. Best to stop straining health systems.
1/1	It‚Äôs okay to be anti vaccine, it is just the natural selection of our time.
1/1	It‚Äôs only a matter of time that I‚Äôll get infected with the positive samples that I‚Äôm testing. I‚Äôm a healthcare worker, a scientist as well doing the covid testing and I‚Äôm thankful I got my vaccine today.
0/0	It‚Äôs perfectly safe!!!!! Trust them blindly you should get it or you‚Äôre a bad person lol
1/1	It‚Äôs plain old Darwinism if they don‚Äôt vaccinate.
1	It‚Äôs pretty darned clear: if you‚Äôre vaxxed your odds are so much stronger. So really, unless you‚Äôre not old enough to be vaxxed or have some really compelling medical complication, get vaxxed to protect YOURSELF and EVERYONE else.
0/0	It‚Äôs probably as safe as ingesting poisons and pollutants could ever be. Anybody with self-respect will decline that offer.
1/0	It‚Äôs really funny how politicians know more than doctors lmao XD
1/-1	It‚Äôs really funny how these people in comment section know more than the doctors.
1/1	It‚Äôs really not sad. Most people I know in NY are practically turning handsprings that they got vaccinated. Just really excited and happy! It‚Äôs a game changer
1/1	It‚Äôs sad and sometimes makes me angry that in a country like the US has such polarising views on vaccines because it‚Äôs soooo available to everyone there. I‚Äôm in South East Asia where vaccines are so hard to get and we‚Äôve been in a constant lockdown for many many months. People here can‚Äôt even get it easily even if they beg for it.
0/0	It‚Äôs sad that people still can support vaccination with the amount of harm it has caused.
0/1	It‚Äôs safe but the manufacturers have zero liability
1/1	It‚Äôs second #coronavirus vaccine dose day for me in #Beijing! Woohoo! #China
0/-1	It‚Äôs simple , the vaccine has NOT gone through the proper Test , there has Not been enough time to do so , it‚Äôs actually impossible to say the vaccine has been scientifically tested and that‚Äôs a FACT ! So keep your hateful gas lighting attacks to yourself .
1/1	It‚Äôs simple, make vaccinations mandatory for everyone! no one allowed back to work, school, flights etc without a valid vaccination certificate! This is how you defeat this disease!
0/0	It‚Äôs simply that it‚Äôs just to early and experimental.
1/1	It‚Äôs so frustrating that when the information is right there, in our faces, some silly folks think it‚Äôs okay to take a lot of resources and then walk away and not get vaccinated. I honestly don‚Äôt get it, to be that sick that you need a ICU bed and then say no to a vaccine. That‚Äôs insanity, doing the same thing, not getting a vaccine yet expecting it won‚Äôt be that bad.
0/-1	It‚Äôs so obvious.
0/0/0/0/0	It‚Äôs so rare, it keeps happening. I‚Äôm good with my natural immunity thanks.
0/-1	It‚Äôs staggering to see how many people are completely brainwashed -
0/0	It‚Äôs still very experimental and we are the guinea pigs! Well not me I will never take any vaccine for corona virus.
1/1	It‚Äôs strange that people think that a vaccine that has helped millions of people will kill them but a virus hat has killed millions won‚Äôt
1/0	It‚Äôs super weird to me because it seems like the same people who were saying ‚Äú99 percent chance of survival‚Äù are also the same people referencing the small amount of people who had adverse reactions to the vaccine.
0/0	It‚Äôs the children they are coming for next, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm worried about, this could make them sterile, hence depopulation.
0/0	It‚Äôs the long term effects, and when the elite wish to reduce populations I think I will give it a miss
1/0	It‚Äôs the needle for me
0/0	It‚Äôs the ones with the shots that are hospitalized. If they put the truth and full truth no one would get it.
0	It‚Äôs the rapture! All of the good people that took the vaccine will die. The sinners will be left behind. It‚Äôs just like the Kirk Cameron movies. I pray you all find Jesus.
1/1	It‚Äôs time for mandatory state and federal vaccinations
1/1	It‚Äôs time people realize that vaccination will safeguard them from this virus
1/1	It‚Äôs time to start canceling the unvaccinated
1/1	It‚Äôs time to start giving out Pfizer and a Moderna shots as a one time with plan to get the boost 3-6 months later, instead of 3 weeks, to maximize the number of people vaccinated and save more lives.
0/0	It‚Äôs time to stop spreading misinformation and calling vaccination side effects rare. It‚Äôs now common
0/0	It‚Äôs untested & unsafe. We all know this except the media & their government masters.
1/1	It‚Äôs very good. There‚Äôs so much to do with it. Now... to get vaccines and be able to go out in the world with it. Can‚Äôt wait!
0/0	It‚Äôs very simple why they don‚Äôt want it dude.... it‚Äôs their body end off and you are not entitled to their body
1/0	It‚Äôs weird how when a virus has a 3% chance of death, people go ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs not that serious, the chance of you dying is only 3% why you taking it so seriously?‚Äù But when a vaccine has a 5% chance of either not working or has adverse side effects (not even a 5% chance of death, just side effects) people go ‚ÄúNO THE VACCINE BAD!! TOO DANGEROUS! I DONT TRUST IT!‚Äù
1/1/1	It‚Äôs weird that the same people who think covid deaths have no statistical significance, are upset about the .00000001 % who may have had a blood clot due to the J&J vaccine. #GetVaccinated
1/1	It‚Äôs weird, vaccines have done their job so well that there are people who are likely alive from them denouncing them
1/1	Iv always been pro vaccine. I was first in line to get the covid shot with the elderly a week after it was released (I work healthcare)
0/0	Iv had every vaccine in life but I won't be touching this . I am not an anti vaxxer I'm just not being bullied into anything. My body my choice
0/-1	Ive got my baseball bat ready if they come to my door
0/0	Ive gotten multiple friends who have gotten covid the past months. The ones vaccinated had a terrible time dealing with the ilness. The ones unvaccinated barely became sick and felt fine after a few days. Maybe its time to stop spreading fake news, mrna vaccines arent the awnser. Living healthy is ;)
0/0	Ive had covid. Vitamin D3 treats the symptoms, like blood clotting and cytokine storm. Do NOT take the vaccine, friend.
0/0	Ivermectin + Vit D + Vit C + Zinc + Selenium + Quercetin = a safe and cheap prevention option.
0/0	Ivermectin and HCQ were taken off market to force the mRNA gene experiment.
1/1	Ivermectin is not a proper cure for Covid-19. There is no cure for the virus, the only effective and well-tested solution are covid-19 vaccines.
0/0	I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll wait a year- let me see what happens to all the guinne pigs first
1/1	I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m in the military and have had the vaccine, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s been over a week and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m fine.√∞≈∏‚Äò¬ç√∞≈∏¬è¬ª
0/0	I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not getting it
0	I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not taking the vaccine. I have a history of having a very bad allergic reaction to all or most vaccines. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve had seizers from getting vaccines, gotten diabetes, and many other unpleasant things have happened to me due to a bad reaction to vaccines. I think people who are not affected in a fatal way by vaccines should get them if they want to. But if your doctor tells you √¢‚Ç¨≈ì don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get it if it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s killing you or you have a extremely bad reaction to it√¢‚Ç¨¬ù . Then don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get it.
0/0	I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m over 50, and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a firm No from me.
1/1	I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve had the vaccine last week and I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m doing great no reaction at all...waiting for the 2nd doze
0/0	I‚Äòd say there is a genuine reason for people to distrust governments that have continuously lied and been corrupt for decades upon decades
1/1/1/1	I‚Äòll get it once it becomes available
1/1	I‚Äòve got my biontech vaccine today, thank you for explaining üíâ
0/1	I‚Äôd be more likely to take it if the media told me not to, with their track record

0/0	I‚Äôll Rather Die From The Fake Coronavirus Than Satanic Vaccine!
0/0	I‚Äôll allow someone more needy to have my dose, the virus is 99%+ recoverable, I‚Äôm not worried,at all, and I‚Äôm immune compromised, help yourself to mine, too many people have died or had VERY negative side affects, good luck to you.
1/1	I‚Äôll be getting my vaccine
1/1	I‚Äôll be happy with letting the more vulnerable ones, and essential workers, getting priority for vaccinations
1/1	I‚Äôll be honest. I had reservations about a vaccine developed hastily in such a politically charged environment. But, by the time my place in line came up, enough people had taken it to assuage some of my own concerns. There may or may not be long term consequences from the vaccine‚Äî but we take vaccines every year without statistically significant problems. But the risk of covid are unpredictable long term health consequences or death, soon. Worse, in my case, almost certain death for my immune compromised husband. In the end, I was grateful for the opportunity to be vaccinated. But what‚Äôs playing out with Republicans is not about reason or normal reservations. It‚Äôs about hubris and frat-boy insolence, an embracing of ignorance as political tribalism. I don‚Äôt see how we survive as a country as long as one political party continues, at the top, to tip the scales to retain power, while simultaneously celebrating ignorance as a political cause among the voters. And I don‚Äôt see us as a country getting this pandemic under control. It‚Äôs a pathetic end game for our country.
0/0	I‚Äôll believe it when we have zero new cases or deaths
1/1	I‚Äôll get it as soon as its available. I‚Äôm ready!
1/1	I‚Äôll get it as soon as it‚Äôs available to me. Any kind of side effects from the vaccine will be better than getting COVID and giving it to my parents or grandparents.
1/1	I‚Äôll get mine as soon as possible!!
1/1	I‚Äôll get the vaccine as well as my family members.
0/0	I‚Äôll get the vaccine soon, very soon in geologic time. In about 15 years. This is a massive experiment. The vaccines may be a great technology for a future pandemic ..but it is insanity to test them on such large numbers of people at once. Resisting that insanity by refusing a vaccine, for at least 5 years, maybe longer, is not just a matter of safety for the younger half of the population, it is a moral duty. It is the most pro-vaccine stance you can take. Why? Because if this experiment goes wrong all vaccine programmes will suffer. Many people may never accept a vaccine again. This experiment is a big stupid gamble, make no mistake. Our Covid vaccine evangelists are have lost their minds with this mass test, now being rolled into children. It is our duty as rational scientific beings to walk out on it.
1/1	I‚Äôll get the vaccine.
1/1/1/1	I‚Äôll get the vaccine. I actually don‚Äôt have a choice at this point.

0/0	I‚Äôll never take that toxic crap
1/1	I‚Äôll never understand people. They‚Äôre afraid to get a vaccine that has minimal links to blood clots. But they‚Äôll take birth control like it‚Äôs candy and they‚Äôd rather be exposed to covid - both of which are KNOWN to cause blood clots.

1/1	I‚Äôm 14 days after my 2nd pfeizer dose. I had a sore arm as side effects. No biggie.
1/1	I‚Äôm 16 weeks pregnant. I was vaccinated back in august. I‚Äôve had no side effects at all. I actually got pregnant while on birth control Ô∏èp
1/1	I‚Äôm 17 and I had my first shot a few days ago. Everything has been really ok, I think.
1/1	I‚Äôm 18 and I got moderna. My first shot was nothing more than a sore arm. But my second was a 103 degree fever (even after Advil) and was woken up with really painful muscle spasms up and down my back the night of. But the next morning I woke up (albeit super late) feeling fine. And the relief I‚Äôve felt since has definitely been worth it.
1/1	I‚Äôm 18 and healthy, haven‚Äôt gotten the vaccine yet but I definitely will.
1/1	I‚Äôm 2 weeks out from my 2nd shot and I continue to mask and wash hands and socially distance. And while I keep doing the things that I have been, the sky is bluer, the heart is fuller, and my smile behind the mask is wider.
1/1	I‚Äôm 33 and have been lucky enough to grow up with all 4 grandparents in my life. November 31st one of my grandpas died of COVID. Last week the other 3 went to the same place together and got dose 1 of the vaccine. I wish he had of been here just a little longer.
0/0/0	I‚Äôm 36 years old and healthy. I have a 99.9% chance of surviving Covid even if I get it. Lots of sources are saying that this current vaccine won‚Äôt protect me from all the variants and that at best maybe 3 months before I‚Äôd need another one. Why in the world would I ever take this vaccine? Nobody knows what the long term effects are going to be and I‚Äôm not going to be a test subject.
1/1	I‚Äôm 48 hours post-Moderna 2nd dose: no side effects, soreness in the muscle from the shot is mostly gone. Quit making excuses & #GetVaccinated ! #Science #EndCovid19 #StopTheSpread

1/1	I‚Äôm SO excited to put Covid behind us. It‚Äôll be like a breath of fresh air. Literally.
0/0	I‚Äôm UNvaxxed and UNboosted. Was home sick over Thanksgiving. Symptoms were MILD and I‚Äôm so grateful my immune system worked as it should. Please tell me what the science says about the safety of these therapies out beyond 450 days. Oh wait that‚Äôs right, the science doesn‚Äôt know.
1/1	I‚Äôm a 12 year old that got the vaccine and I‚Äôm doing awesome right now. I would recommend the vaccine if you haven‚Äôt got it just so we could get back to normal
1/1	I‚Äôm a 16 year old from Fairbanks Alaska and last week me and my 53 year old dad got our vaccines together ofc because anyone 16 or older in AK has access to the vaccine. Neither of have had any side effects whatsoever, there were no symptoms whatsoever either. I assume every Hasan fan knows that getting a vaccine is the right decision but seeing as I got my vaccine much earlier than most people my age I have the authority to tell you that it is very safe. I implore you to get it.
1/1	I‚Äôm a 19 and just got my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine üíâüòÅ

1/1	I‚Äôm a 65-year-old female and had my 2 Moderna shots 4/16 and 5/14. My 75-year-old husband refuses to get his. Oh, well; guess I‚Äôll be widowed a second time. This time, from his sheer stupidity.
1/1	I‚Äôm a Baptist pastor in IL. There is nothing about vaccines in the Bible. I‚Äôve read it cover to cover. Don‚Äôt blame God for not wanting to be vaxed. Jesus is for health and healing. I tell my folks to get the shot. Peace.
0	I‚Äôm a Canadian respiratory therapist and I declined my vaccine.
1/1	I‚Äôm a Clinical Nurse Specialist with over a decade of experience in nursing & a Masters in Public Health. I have had my 3 #CovidVaccine‚Äôs and recommended that all my family & friends do the same.
1/1	I‚Äôm a New Yorker who would show up for a vaccine day or night 24/7. I‚Äôm not alone. Knowing that capacity is going underutilized due to bureaucratic mismanagement is infuriating.
1/-1	I‚Äôm a RN who lost my brother in law to COVID delta variant . I believe that the priority should be early intervention , it was to late for him .
1/1	I‚Äôm a Respiratory Therapist who works in south eastern Virginia. This past week we‚Äôve seen triple the amount of SEVERE Covid cases than at the worst from the first wave last year.Something is definitely different. And YES, we‚Äôve seen a young patient as well.If this is any indication of what‚Äôs to come, we will run out of room and staff. Not to sound all gloom and doom but yes, people are believing the myths unfortunately. Several patients who have lost their lives in the past week have wished they would have been vaccinated. It has been a sad week indeed. When people started being vaccinated our Covid numbers dropped to almost nil. Medical science at it‚Äôs best! I dont know about strains and what the difference is but people need to heed the warnings. Vaccines work.
1	I‚Äôm a cater working on the front line & been working right through this pandemic. I‚Äôve worked in a hospital & care homes with patients with covid. To say you feel useless is an understatement when you see someone dying of covid in so much pain & discomfort when all you can do is make them as comfortable as possible. Thankfully I‚Äôm double vaccinated & had my booster but I‚Äôve had 2 out of 4 of my kids have had covid. My 17 year old daughter had it in June & she was bad, she was vomiting, high temperature, no sense of smell or taste & a really bad cough. Thankfully she didn‚Äôt need to go into hospital. My 14 year old son had it a month ago, he was lucky & was only like a really bad cold with him. They where both isolating in there rooms & I was taking food & drinks to them but made sure I wore a mask & sanatised my hands. I guess I‚Äôve been really lucky by not catching covid, so my point to people who won‚Äôt have the vaccine, if it‚Äôs that ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù the vaccine must be doing something as I‚Äôm still here after 3 jabs & avoided catching covid after being in close contact with people with covid a fair few times????
1/1	I‚Äôm a doctor. Get that booster. The strongest immunity looks to be a combo of post-infection and vaccine-mediated immunity.
1/1	I‚Äôm a massive advocate for taking these vaccines, and even I don‚Äôt think it should be mandatory. They need to build trust in the vaccines in order to get people to take them, and forcing people to take them does the opposite. I fully trust them and will be proud to take them when able, but you can‚Äôt make people come together for the greater good by forcing something on them.
0/0	I‚Äôm a nurse and I am not getting the vaccine.
1/1	I‚Äôm a nurse and got mine as soon as I could! My mother is 81 and has hers now too. We are both a month in to our second dose. I just was able to hug my mom for the first time in 13 months! It was wonderful!
1/1	I‚Äôm a nurse and received mine on Monday. No side effects but a sore arm. I honestly feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I can‚Äôt wait to get the second dose and be done with it. Science is amazing
1/1	I‚Äôm a paediatric consultant. I‚Äôm triple-jabbed because the science clearly shows the benefits of #CovidVaccine far outweigh the risks for me,& being vaccinated reduces the risk of me passing the virus on to others, including my elderly mum & vulnerable children #GetVaccinated
1/1/1	I‚Äôm a pro-vaxxer. Anyone want to have a debate about vaccines?
0/-1	I‚Äôm a proud ex vaxxer! I decided to look into what‚Äôs in the deadly destructive things...Wtf!!! Injecting anything is junkie play ...
1/1	I‚Äôm a public school teacher, I am 100% going to be taking a vaccine as soon as possible to make sure I don‚Äôt spread anything unintentionally to my students or colleagues. When we have the tools to stop suffering, we need to use them.
0/0/0/0	I‚Äôm a registered nurse and I refuse to get it!
0/0	I‚Äôm a researcher in the medical field and a lot is being hidden from us regarding the safety of the vaccines. I‚Äôm sure Mike has already been vaccinated, glad he‚Äôs not carrying a baby!
1/1	I‚Äôm a science guy. My degree‚Äôs in biology and chemistry. I understand the COVID biology and the science behind the vaccines. I got mine, both. Tell your friends to get theirs, too.
1/0	I‚Äôm a scientist and I know how quickly integrity goes out the window when funding or even just a hot topic is at stake. There is immense political pressure to produce a vaccine, which can be accounted for in terms of personal risk.
1/1	I‚Äôm a teacher and I got my first shot within 3 days of being eligible- my second one three weeks later. So many of my students and colleagues have lost family to COVID-19 - including me. Thank God you are in office amd science amd logic prevails!
1/1	I‚Äôm a teacher in Iowa. We are supposed to be in the first tier of the next round, but nothing is happening. We are in person teaching and doing well, but want to be vaccinated so we are protecting ourselves and others.
1/1	I‚Äôm a teacher. I can‚Äôt wait until I can get a vaccine and hopefully get my students all back in person again
1/1	I‚Äôm a teacher. I will take the vaccine to protect myself and my family as soon as they allow me to take it. I want to be able to socialize with my family and my friends.
1/1	I‚Äôm a volunteer for the AstraZeneca trial in Washington state and I got my first injection yesterday.
1/1	I‚Äôm a young woman who had the vaccine due to my history of Cancer and an autoimmune disease. I felt really rough for 48 hours after, but I promise you, I would rather have had that than had Covid-19.
1/1	I‚Äôm absolutely fine .. just mild pain at injection site ! So far so good ! It appears safe ! Don‚Äôt worry about #safety & get a jab when your turn comes up !
0/0	I‚Äôm actually don‚Äôt want to vaccinate my toddler if covid-19 vaccine come out in November. I‚Äôm a Pro-Vaccine person, but I think this vaccine is getting rush, I may be one of the first people to get it in November because I‚Äôm a CNA at a senior health care facility, my husband have asthma and he‚Äôs a front line worker, so he may be able to get it too, but I think is too risky to inject a young child with a vaccine with so little testing. Is a hard decision to take.
0/0	I‚Äôm afraid of a vaccine that they complete in less than 6 months
0/0	I‚Äôm afraid that the COVID vaccine will kill me or damage me in some way that will make life not worth living. I don‚Äôt feel ‚Äúicky‚Äù about the ingredients, I feel sheer terror
1/1	I‚Äôm alive and fine. It works. I understand being weary but these vaccines have been distributed to millions upon millions. Across the world. Yet finding the random cases that go bad to make a narrative is gross. We‚Äôd be in a whole new pandemic if all the fear mongering was true
1/1	I‚Äôm all for covid-19 vaccination
1/1	I‚Äôm all for vaccination and I acknowledge their importance but it seems that they are willing to push forward the Astra Zeneca vaccine despite it‚Äôs obvious risks !!
1/1	I‚Äôm all for vaccines because I believe in science and the effectiveness of vaccines.
1/1	I‚Äôm all vaxxed up. Dose 1. Had a bit of a sore arm and slight fever that night. Next day all ok Dose 2. Lymph glands a bit swollen, a minor headache, and mild fever again next day. After that, just fine.
0/0	I‚Äôm allergic to testing positive for HIV I will not be taking the shot,

1/1	I‚Äôm am 59 yo and fully vaccinated as of yesterday
1/1	I‚Äôm angry about the vaccine distribution - canceling appointments and having insufficient doses for New York City makes absolutely no sense. People have been waiting for weeks. This is one of the original epicenters and the most densely populated city in the country.
0/0	I‚Äôm anti vaccines. All of them. I will undermine confidence in them for good reason.
1/1	I‚Äôm as Pro-Vax as one can be.
0/0	I‚Äôm autoimmune, you can‚Äôt force me to take something that has an unknown chance of death
1/1	I‚Äôm blessed to have received my first dose last week. Thank you to all the researchers and scientists who made this possible. I truly believe it‚Äôs been a miracle!
1/1	I‚Äôm boosted to bejaysus Thank God but we also think you Americans are really loud and mad. Do they teach science in America? Lots of love Ireland Xxx
1/1	I‚Äôm breastfeeding and got my vaccine which makes me so happy
0/0	I‚Äôm coming around to the idea that there isn‚Äôt actually anything in the vaccines, just placebos
1/1	I‚Äôm completely pro vaccine, but I have my reservations about a/z jab. I was quite open 3 weeks ago that as we get closer to when vaccines start to kick in efficacy wise, if they are not working as well as hoped we‚Äôll start finding resistant mutations.
0/1	I‚Äôm convinced that I‚Äôm immune to Covid. The vaccine didn‚Äôt even give me one side effect.
1/0	I‚Äôm curious as to when in medical history there hasn‚Äôt been side effects. I need to see causation. This is speculative.
1/1	I‚Äôm curious why people with all this paranoia about mRNA don‚Äôt get the J&J vaccine?
0/0	I‚Äôm definitely NOT going to be a lab rat and take this vaccine. You can‚Äôt force people
0/0	I‚Äôm definitely concerned about the long term ramifications on autoimmune disease, inflammation and human genome
1/0	I‚Äôm definitely not an anti-Vaccination type of person but they just came out with this vaccine who even knows if it‚Äôs safe.
0/0	I‚Äôm depending on God on this one
1/1	I‚Äôm double vaccined, got Covid a week ago, there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôd want to go through that unvaccinated
0/0	I‚Äôm double vaxxed and was way sicker with Covid than my friends who got it that weren‚Äôt vaxxed. Plus I was the only one in my family who got the virus and I‚Äôm the only one vaxxed!! Please stop with the vaccine. It obviously isn‚Äôt working.
1/1	I‚Äôm ecstatic to be among the third who has one shot. Second dose April 28! Let‚Äôs do this!
1/-1	I‚Äôm excited for mine!
1/1	I‚Äôm excited we‚Äôre moving forward! Right now per the Bloomberg vaccine tracker were at ~2.4M doses a day with ~130M doses administered so far. At the current pace, we will hit the 200M mark around April 23, with April 30th being Biden‚Äôs 100th day. Though the doses are likely to increase daily, with the possibility of it actually decreasing at the end of April due to supply outweighing demand.
1/1	I‚Äôm extremely pro vaccine (and can‚Äôt wait for mine) but if you‚Äôre under 65 and not actively working a Covid ward we see you vax-bragging while our older relatives with extreme comorbidities still aren‚Äôt eligible or can‚Äôt locate a dose and I swear our judgement knows no limits.
1/1	I‚Äôm finally negative. Never got super sick (no fever, chills or even cough) just sore throat, runny nose, and mild congestion) thanks vaccines. Not here for a debate anti vaxxers
1/0	I‚Äôm fine bro. I got it
1/1	I‚Äôm fine to get vaccines. Myself and my daughter have had all the normal vaccines
0/1	I‚Äôm fine to get vaccines. Myself and my daughter have had all the normal vaccines but I do not trust that this one won‚Äôt have been rushed through the process.
1/1/1	I‚Äôm for vaccinations, although I will never be among the first to get a vaccine. I will always wait for all the side effects of the vaccines to come out and do my research before I get a vaccine.
1	I‚Äôm from Arkansas, working in the ICU and this is very true about patients not wanting to believe that they have COVID and refuse the vaccine. It‚Äôs frustrating.
0/0	I‚Äôm from England üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åø.. also me and so many British people will not be having the vaccine don‚Äôt trust your government!!!!!
1/1	I‚Äôm from Texas and pro-vaccination all the way. This is only a small percentage of Texas but it‚Äôs still very embarrassing.
1/0	I‚Äôm from the USA and I‚Äôm embarrassed by the conduct of my government agencies with respect to the Astra Zeneca vaccine.
0/0	I‚Äôm from the uk and I‚Äôm so very sick 2 weeks after taking the vaccine please beware I have arthritis and it‚Äôs much worse it makes you feel like you‚Äôre dying
1/1	I‚Äôm fully vaccinated and that was my choice. If people don‚Äôt want to get vaccinated that is also their choice. I think that the vaccine is a positive thing but I also think that in the land of the free people should be free to do what they want with their bodies.
1/1	I‚Äôm fully vaccinated and was diagnosed today, I can‚Äôt taste but I can smell. I feel exhausted and I‚Äôm congested with a light cough. Not the greatest of feelings but I‚Äôm glad I got the vaccine because I can‚Äôt imagine how I‚Äôd be feeling if I hadn‚Äôt gotten it.
1/1	I‚Äôm fully vaccinated as of today. In two weeks once I reach full immunity, I‚Äôm moving on with my life. I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôve held up the proverbial umbrella for a year. I have seen no one I love in months. I‚Äôm starting my life again. If people wanna wait for herd immunity, go for it. But the vaccine is my ticket and everyone‚Äôs else‚Äôs ticket out of this.
0/1/1	I‚Äôm genuinely envious of those who have the privilege to think covid is all some big hoax or isn‚Äôt a big deal and can brush off stuff like the vaccine. That tells me they were lucky enough to not see the direct consequences of it. Losing a loved one on a ventilator changes you.
1/1	I‚Äôm getting first shot on Monday and I‚Äôm so pumped!!
1/1	I‚Äôm getting it, I trust it. However, doctors and scientists are not helping themselves by saying ‚Äúyou still have to wear a mask for the long haul, even after both shots.‚Äù You want people to stop saying this is social engineering? Then stop the propaganda
1/1	I‚Äôm getting it, but I don‚Äôt want it forced on my fellows.
1/1	I‚Äôm getting it.

1/1	I‚Äôm getting my second Moderna shot tomorrow. After the first one I had chills and nausea for about 24 hours. My coworkers who got their second shot earlier this week ranged from arm soreness and general fatigue to full blown flu like symptoms for about 24 hours. I expect to feel the same but I‚Äôm ready for it! Update: got my second shot and I‚Äôm doing fine. No fever, no chills, nothing. Yah. About half my coworkers had no reaction, while the other half had fever, chills etc.
1/1	I‚Äôm getting my second and final dose tomorrow
1/1	I‚Äôm getting my second dose next monday! I‚Äôm so excited!!! I haven‚Äôt had any colateral effects after the first dose
1/-1	I‚Äôm getting my second dose tomorrow! I might get a tattoo (my first and maybe only!) to commemorate the end of this shit show. Maybe a couple of bandaids overlapping in an ‚Äúx‚Äù where they stick me in the arm. Or my n95 hung up on a coat hanger. The relief I have felt since I got the first dose has already been immense. I have a girl that I care about deeply who I absolutely could not spread it to and my job is about as frontline as it gets so that was a constant risk I didn‚Äôt want to take with her, among everyone else in my life basically. But now for the same reason I was so risky, I get to be blessed with an early vaccine, and I can see the end of this on the horizon now.
1/1	I‚Äôm getting my second shot of Pfizer next week. I had extreme fatigue after the first one for 24 hours. Hopefully the second one isn‚Äôt as bad :( but better than getting Covid!
1/1	I‚Äôm getting my second shot on Thursday
1/1	I‚Äôm getting my vaccination today!
1/1	I‚Äôm getting my vaccine in 6 days
1/1	I‚Äôm getting my vaccine on the 26th of March, I feel so relieved to know that at the very least I‚Äôll get some degree of protection against Coronavirus.
1/1	I‚Äôm getting my vaccine this thursday
1/1/1/1	I‚Äôm getting my vaccine tomorrow
1/1	I‚Äôm getting the Pfizer tomorrow just because of the FDA approval and Trump says to get it.
1/1	I‚Äôm getting the shot... But please stop saying ‚Äútrust me on this‚Äù. It reminds me (and others I‚Äôm sure) of Donald Trump, and everytime he says that, I know it‚Äôs probably wrong.
1/1	I‚Äôm getting the vaccine later this month
1/-1	I‚Äôm getting the vaccine on Thursday I‚Äôm excited and nervouss and same time with the side effect

1/1	I‚Äôm getting vaccinated tomorrow! A little nervous but excited
1/1	I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm vaxxed. I‚Äôm home with covid but my symptoms have been almost nonexistent. So much better than what I could be going through.
1/1	I‚Äôm glad Jimmy and family are all OK. I tested positive for Covid, Have had cold symptoms for two weeks, but symptoms are not serious, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs because of being vaccinated and boosted. Those who think the vaccination and getting boosted don‚Äôt make a difference, it‚Äôs about minimizing symptoms and keeping out of the hospital please do it!
0/0/0/0	I‚Äôm glad that they didn‚Äôt make it mandatory. No vaccins for us
1/1	I‚Äôm glad to hear the good news.
0/-1	I‚Äôm glad to see a lot of people are willing to defend their rights as Americans instead of complying. If we comply, we might as well be like Venezuela.
0/0	I‚Äôm glad to see that everyone is awaked from this nightmare called Covid-19. We don‚Äôt need a vaccine!
0/1	I‚Äôm glad you said all of this because I am pro vaccination I make sure myself and all of my kids get there vaccines however when it comes to this vaccine I will not be getting it nor will my children why would I wanna be a guineapig for the fastest vaccine ever made no way in hell
1/1	I‚Äôm going to be first in line. They are going to lock the country down in March. You will need a card to go out. I‚Äôll take the vaccine to keep my freedom.
1/-1	I‚Äôm going to be honest, I was deathly afraid of the vaccine. I‚Äôm only partially vaccinated and every single person around me has caught Covid that I‚Äôve been in close contact with. Several times. I‚Äôve not tested positive since the vaccine despite all the exposure. I had Covid back when it was first hitting everyone before the vaccine was available. Never caught it again. I know people who‚Äôve caught it 2-3 times.
1/1/1/1	I‚Äôm going to be vaccinated on Wednesday!
1/1	I‚Äôm going to college and doing research on this and it‚Äôs infuriating that ppl don‚Äôt listen to scientists who go through years near decades of learning and schooling to be discredited by selfish idiots
1	I‚Äôm going to get Sputnik V because it has had long term development and testing for Safety and Effectiveness.
1/0	I‚Äôm going to kiss all of my friends straight on the mouth when I see them in person. I‚Äôve already gotten consent.
1/1	I‚Äôm going to say that vaccines are not an infringement on your liberty, they just make sure you like a healthy life free of horrible diseases
1/1	I‚Äôm going to take the vaccine for other people: pregnant women, younger kids, and the 7% of adults (immunocompromised) who won‚Äôt be able to take a vaccine early. If I don‚Äôt take it, I‚Äôm endangering them. They are counting on us or they are in real danger
1/1	I‚Äôm gonna get the vaccine because I‚Äôm not worried about it. But some people are. People worried about contracting it need to mask and get the vaccine
1/1	I‚Äôm gonna get vaccinated in like an hour wish me luck
0/0	I‚Äôm gonna pray to god to heal me instead of getting the vaccine even tho i haven‚Äôt got corona yet.
0/0	I‚Äôm good with my natural immunity thanks.
0/1	I‚Äôm good!! Y‚Äôall have fun with that vaccine! I‚Äôll let the old folks get it and hospital clinical staff!!
0/1	I‚Äôm good!! Y‚Äôall have fun with that vaccine! I‚Äôll let the old folks get it and hospital clinical staff!! ‚úåÔ∏è
1/1	I‚Äôm grateful for the vaccine. I‚Äôve had both doses of Moderna. A little tired and a few chills after my 2nd. Beats the hell out of being on a ventilator in the hospital struggling to breathe
0/-1	I‚Äôm guessing she took it or was she always this dead Ô∏è
1/1	I‚Äôm happy I got vaccinated.
1/1/1	I‚Äôm happy about pfizer and the coronavirus vaccine
1/1	I‚Äôm happy to be vaccinated & to do my part to contribute to herd immunity in hopes of returning to a normal life. If you aren‚Äôt getting vaccinated, that‚Äôs your choice and your freedom. People who choose to receive the vaccine are allowed to be excited & to be hopeful. I know I am!
1/1	I‚Äôm hoping that once I am working for Duke come January I will have arrived in time to still get the vaccine. My current facility started administering it yesterday and I have to wait until January so I can get both doses from one location
1/1	I‚Äôm hoping to get into a trial. I think it‚Äôs crazy to stay at risk for covid any longer than necessary.
1/1	I‚Äôm in America and has signed up to receive the vaccine. I was worried at first because covid really affects people of color disproportionately. I am also a colon cancer survivor. Right now in my state they are only vaccinating seniors 65 years of age and older along with essential workers. To sign up I had to go online and register which required some basic personal information. I received and emailed confirmation for the registration and was told I would be notified when I am eligible for an appointment to receive it at the appointed time at a designated location. I thank your for sharing this very interesting and informative information. After hearing this professional discuss in detail every aspect of this effort I feel confident in receiving it. I do not know which vaccine I will get but I will still protect myself and others by wearing the mask, social distance and good personal hygiene. I understand the vaccine may not protect from variants.
0/0	I‚Äôm in UK and literally can‚Äôt understand why anyone in their right mind would want this vaccine. It‚Äôs had 5% of the normal testing time and you can‚Äôt sue if it goes wrong!!!! ??? !
1/1	I‚Äôm in my 30s had it before the vaccine (pretty severe) second time I was fully vaxxed hardly affected me more than a cold .. these people are paying with their lives Ô∏è my age saved me the first time, the vaccine the second
1/0	I‚Äôm in my 50s and have a lung disorder. For me, I‚Äôm fairly certain the side effects of COVID would be way worse than the vaccine.
1/1	I‚Äôm in my early 40s both vaccines kicked my butt the next day. I‚Äôm not sure why both affected me but the side effects lasted for about one day.
1/1	I‚Äôm in no way anti vaccine but my biggest fear is that it keeps mutating to get around the vaccine which will kill those that aren‚Äôt vaccinated. My family are big anti-vaxxers and it scares the hell out of me.
1/1	I‚Äôm in the Jansson (J+J) vaccine trial which is an Adenovirus vector. Pretty sure I got placebo. :( I‚Äôd be psyched if that one gets approved and they offer the control arm it quickly. As far as vaccines in general I‚Äôm pretty sure it will go from unavailable to mandatory with no optional in between and I‚Äôm ok with that.
1/1	I‚Äôm in the US and on stage 3 of this trial. Very excited to hear this vaccine is moving forward!
1/1/0/1	I‚Äôm in the moderna clinical trial, so feel free to ask any Q about the vaccine.
1/1	I‚Äôm in the second tier/group after our wonderful health care workers. Patiently waiting to do my part.
1/1	I‚Äôm interested in seeing what the average daily vaccination figure ends up being for Biden‚Äôs first 100 days. Think 2.5 million/day is feasible given the slower start? I think anything that gets us near 200 million people in the US vaccinated by April 30th would be a great start.
1/1	I‚Äôm interested in trying the vaccine
0	I‚Äôm just a kid who got it against my will, all these people are saying it‚Äôs bad‚Äî I don‚Äôt wanna die
0/0	I‚Äôm just an observer sitting here watching those participating in this great human experiment wondering just how many jabs they‚Äôll continue to inject until they reach their oh shit moment that something is clearly not right
0/-1	I‚Äôm just gonna say this one thing. This is just my opinion! The government makes you believe what they WANT you to believe.
1/1	I‚Äôm just recently passed the 2 week mark after my second dose.
0/-1	I‚Äôm just waiting for Pfizer to say pets also need vaccines and the boosters.
0/0	I‚Äôm just waiting for a few more years pass & we find out that it was all just the biggest money grab in our history
1/-1	I‚Äôm kinda lost about this. Is this a good thing? Sorry if this sounds stupid but can someone explain it to me? Thank you
1/1	I‚Äôm laughing at how people care more about the side effects then the positive affects, Like not dying!
1/1	I‚Äôm leaning toward moderna from the start I always had a good feeling about that one.
1/1	I‚Äôm like hello you‚Äôve had other vaccines based off the same thing but of course she won‚Äôt listen to reason.
1/-1	I‚Äôm liking all this good news.
1/1	I‚Äôm looking forward to get the vaccine!!!
1/1/1/1	I‚Äôm low priority, which is as it should be, though I can‚Äôt wait to get that shot. Or shots.
1	I‚Äôm more afraid of government keeping covid powers, than dying from covid vaccine...
0/0	I‚Äôm more scared of the vaccine than covid itself. Covid has like a 99.5% survival rate or something like that so it shouldn‚Äôt be a big deal unless your old and have health problems
0	I‚Äôm more sure of my choice every day - and especially glad I didn‚Äôt let myself be talked into getting my kiddos vaxxed.
0/0	I‚Äôm more than willing to lose my life than to be a hell candidate for the rest of my life! Jesus is my vaccine! I need no other
0/0	I‚Äôm neither elderly or immunocompromised, but I haven‚Äôt had kids yet. And until they‚Äôve tested this vaccine on pregnant women, researched it‚Äôs affect on fertility, and researched how it would impact children, I‚Äôm not touching it with a ten foot pole.
0/0	I‚Äôm never getting vaccinated
0/0	I‚Äôm never getting your gene editing serum
1/-1	I‚Äôm never sure who to believe when it comes to vaccines. The scientists who‚Äôve made it their lives work or the guy I went to school with that picked his nose & ate it and now abuses steroids
0/0	I‚Äôm never taking the first two and I‚Äôm almost as hell never taking the booster. Stay the hell away from me
1/1/1	I‚Äôm no COVID denier, heck I got both of my COVID shots. I feel fine, it works!
0/0	I‚Äôm no lab rat and I‚Äôve already seen what it‚Äôs doing to so many lives. Killing them within days or weeks blaming underlined conditions yet, when people actually die of underlined conditions, they are calling most deaths COVID! No transparency at all
0/0	I‚Äôm not a believer in the flu shot, either. I just think that our body needs to fight off things naturally
0/0	I‚Äôm not a scientist but I listen to them ! The problem with using the genetic material is , how do u know it will release the correct virus code ? And the worry is autoimmune disease as a result ! It‚Äôs also unethical to use this type of technology on masses of people without a proper study ! Who knows what may happen to people vaccinated in 2/3 years time .
0/0	I‚Äôm not a test lab rat!. And nope, I don‚Äôt receive flu shots, never had the flu in my life.
0/0	I‚Äôm not afraid... I‚Äôm just not going to get a vaccine that gives me antibodies that I already have from having COVID.... I‚Äôm guessing by the time I need one it really won‚Äôt be that important though considering the amount of natural immunity plus vaccine immunity
1/-1	I‚Äôm not against getting the vaccine , I feel you have the right to choose ! What I am against is the government mandating it and forcing it on everyone
0/0	I‚Äôm not an Anti Vaxxer but I ain‚Äôt taking the Covid Vaxx
0/0	I‚Äôm not an anti Vaxxer but I just want to know the long term side effects before I ever take a vaccine
1/1	I‚Äôm not an anti vax trust me but I really hope this works
0/0	I‚Äôm not an anti vaxxer by no means but this vaccine was super rushed so I‚Äôm skeptical.
1/-1	I‚Äôm not an expert but it might not ever end since people don‚Äôt want to get vaccinated and wear masks but it will go away mostly away I think
1/0	I‚Äôm not an ‚ÄúAnti vaxxer‚Äù but I am Pro-choice!!
1/1	I‚Äôm not anti vaccine, i‚Äôm anti forcing people to get it.
1/-1	I‚Äôm not anti vaccine.
0/0	I‚Äôm not anti vax but I‚Äôm going to wait a year to see if it has any negatives to then I‚Äôll probably get it
0/0	I‚Äôm not anti vax either, I just don‚Äôt wanna pump my body with expermental vaccines that haven‚Äôt got long term effects yet
0/-1	I‚Äôm not anti vaxx but I am not taking this one, I have an immune system thank you very much.
0/0/0/0/-1	I‚Äôm not anti-vaccination, but I find it highly concerning that this hasn‚Äôt even been around long and there is simply not enough time to adequately test long term effects. For me, this one is a hard pass. I need time to make an informed decision, not a rush to see who is first at my family‚Äôs expense.
0/0	I‚Äôm not being part of this experimental vaccine
1/1	I‚Äôm not engaging with antivax folk . I have had vaccinations my whole life, so has my child . I have to trust the science as it has allowed so much good and prevented so much disease .

0/0	I‚Äôm not just going to get on a bandwagon like the rest and just get the vaccine‚Äù
0/0	I‚Äôm not letting fluid created by billionaires be injected in to me even though the ‚Äúscience‚Äù backs it. Their motives for mandating it are very shady.

0/0	I‚Äôm not putting this toxic shit in my body even if I have to risk my life and rights I don‚Äôt care cause it‚Äôs my body my choice if I don‚Äôt want to
1/1	I‚Äôm not saying that vaccines are 100% safe. I‚Äôm just saying that its better to get a vaccine than to not get one
0/0	I‚Äôm not scared of COVID 19 because a lower percentage of ppl have had rlly bad effects on it
1/1	I‚Äôm not sure how long it‚Äôll take to get to young people like myself, but I‚Äôm looking forward to getting it and being able to live my life.
0/-1	I‚Äôm not sure how to feel anymore and that hurts
0/-1	I‚Äôm not sure this makes sense. How could you possibly know that your body has a better immune response with a vaccine vs natural antibodies? Is there any other examples of something where a vaccine outperforms natural antibodies?
1/1	I‚Äôm not sure why you are so determined to find reasons why the vaccine does not work. There is clear evidence that it does work. The stuff you sent makes no point at all, because most of Israel is not yet vaccinated.
1/1	I‚Äôm not sure why, but YouTube comments are dumb as fuck. Go to the new comments section on a legit vaccine video. The word ‚Äúpropaganda‚Äù and ‚Äúsheep‚Äù gets thrown around a lot and it really upsets me.
0/0	I‚Äôm not taking a vaccine that a) Seems way too rushed and hasn‚Äôt had the side-effects properly studied and recorded and b) Will likely contain unnecessary shark squalene, leading to the death of around 500,000 already endangered sharks
0/0	I‚Äôm not taking it , inject to the makers of that vaccine first
0/0	I‚Äôm not taking it, and you shouldn‚Äôt either.
0/0	I‚Äôm not taking it. Why because operation warp speed is entirely too fast. I am not willing to put me or my children through it knowing that my children and i have allergies. Not only that i just don‚Äôt really trust the medical industry for personal reasons.
0/0	I‚Äôm not taking that crap vaccine......not going to force my kid to either.
0/0	I‚Äôm not taking the vaccine. Vaccines are literally Government Sponsored Eugenics programs to make people sick and reduce their cognitive abilities.
0/0	I‚Äôm not taking this crap. People dying of blood clots and heart attacks.
0/0	I‚Äôm not taking this vaccine and neither are my children!
0/0	I‚Äôm not taking this. I don‚Äôt even take the flu vaccine. If I get sick, I will stay home. I thought that was how people always handled being sick.,
0/0	I‚Äôm not trying the first batch of anything, especially not a vaccine
0/1	I‚Äôm not vaccinated against covid, I am against everything else. But I did recover from it. And with all the new studies coming out, I believe recovering is proving to be more effective protection than the vaccine but time will tell if that is true or not I suppose. Either way, I think recovery should count as vaccinated. In the meanwhile hopefully I don‚Äôt lose my job.
0/0	I‚Äôm not vaccine hesitant, I‚Äôm not taking it. For the same reason I don‚Äôt take a flu jab every year - I‚Äôm in my 30‚Äôs and I‚Äôm not at risk.
0/0	I‚Äôm not wearing a mask because that‚Äôs my decision I‚Äôm not taken the vaccine because that‚Äôs my decision and my body I do not trust the vaccine I do not trust the people who made the vaccine my body my choice
0/0	I‚Äôm not your guinea pig, maybe you are but I‚Äôm not.
0/0	I‚Äôm now an anti-vaxxer but a vaccine developed in 6-12 months is giving me doubts.
1/1/1/1	I‚Äôm okay waiting. But as soon as it‚Äôs available I‚Äôll sign up immediately.
0/0	I‚Äôm on a fb page for Covid victims families and friends, it is a daily occurrence with people dying from the vaccine and they are all being swept under the carpet.
1/1	I‚Äôm on immune suppressant medication (Azathioprine) and had the Oxford Vaccine. I had a sore arm and the chills for 2 days but then I was fine. The jab is safe and it‚Äôs best to be protected.
0/0	I‚Äôm on zero vaccine and doing very well
0/0	I‚Äôm over 50, and it‚Äôs a firm No from me.
1/1	I‚Äôm past day 3 on moderna no side affects sore arm is getting better I will keep you updated
1/1	I‚Äôm perfectly fine, a tiny bit sore for about 5 minutes but that was it. So far anyway.
1/1/1/1/1/1	I‚Äôm praying that the vaccine will work and praying for a better 2021
0/0/0	I‚Äôm pregnant and definetly not getting it. I‚Äôm trying to put as little things possible in and on my body that is not thoroughly documented for safety. So it‚Äôs a no and I don‚Äôt think anyone is going to try and pressure me, although everyone else at work will likely ‚Äúhave to‚Äù take it (not literally of course but they‚Äôre are going to feel strong pressure from bosses and even colleagues I think). Also here in Sweden we are in general a bit careful with new vaccines after the panic mass-vaccination against the svineflu that occurred which led to an increased rate of narcolepsie in children and adolescents who got it. The state was for a long time paying out reimbursements for the affected ones... If I hadn‚Äôt been pregnant I would probably struggle a bit more with the decision though.
1/1	I‚Äôm pretty sure COVID has fucked my brain harder than any vaccine ever could so please get vaccinated
1/1	I‚Äôm pretty sure getting the vaccine is better/less risky than getting the virus
1/-1	I‚Äôm pro vaccine, but recently I‚Äôm slowly to appreciate people who doesn‚Äôt wanna get the vaccines. I mean, the world is overpopulated anyways so someone has gotta die.
1/1	I‚Äôm pro vaccines but I‚Äôm against mandates. If people want to jump off the bridge just don‚Äôt take me with you I‚Äôm fine.
1/1	I‚Äôm pro vax and am vaccinated but I had Covid before being vaxxed and it was nothing compared to getting it after being vaxxed lol
1/1	I‚Äôm pro-vaccine because when people don‚Äôt vaccinate themselves and their children it increases the risks of them and others getting the disease.
1/1	I‚Äôm pro-vaccine. I‚Äôm diabetic and when COVID-19 came out I was a auto technician for Walmart. The virus scared me so much that I quit my job because I didn‚Äôt know who might have had it and I was hearing a lot of coughing at work. The moment I heard of a vaccine I signed up to get it because I didn‚Äôt want to risk my own death and possibly passing it on. Plus the only side effect I got from the COVID-19 vaccine was a slight headache. I trust my doctors with my life. Thank you Dr. Llanes, without you I probably would be in a far worse situation than I was. Thank you Dr. Roberts, thanks to you I‚Äôm finally recovering from my inguinal hernia.
1/1	I‚Äôm proud and I feel so privileged to be vaccinated. I‚Äôve been to places in the world where folks don‚Äôt take immunization for granted! I am vaccinated to protect myself, my family ( even the extended Covid deniers) and my community

0/0	I‚Äôm proud to be NOT vaccinated and proud to have that right over my own body and not fall victim to the propaganda, BS and lies! Vaccines are harming 1000s of people. I‚Äôve had Covid and was fine. It‚Äôs a flu. I sleep well knowing I don‚Äôt have to worry about the vaccine injuries!!
1/1	I‚Äôm proud to be vaccinated. I did it to protect myself. I did it protect my family and friends. It was part of what I could personally do to help us get through this public health crisis.
0/0/0/0	I‚Äôm quitting my job if they require me to take it.
1/1	I‚Äôm really tired of these anti vaxer wingnuts. I‚Äôm on the autism spectrum, I didn‚Äôt catch it from a vaccine. There weren‚Äôt many 75 yrs ago. I inherited it from my father who was also on the spectrum & my son inherited it from me (just wish he had also inherited my math abilities)
1/-1	I‚Äôm really trying to become confident enough in this vaccine as to allow it for my family and myself.
1/-1	I‚Äôm really trying to become confident enough in this vaccine as to allow it for my family and myself. This was helpful

1/-1	I‚Äôm right in line after the Queen of England
1/1	I‚Äôm right there with you, Mayim! I haven‚Äôt taken the flu vaccine in years and I did not have my kids take it either. But last year I did. I, too, made my own vaccination schedule for both of my boys. I will be getting the COVID vaccine ASAP! And will be having my boys get it, too.
0/0	I‚Äôm scared of the vaccine because a lower percentage of ppl have had rlly bad effects on it
0/0	I‚Äôm scared they will force me to take the vaccine while I‚Äôm pregnant.. I just don‚Äôt feel that they know enough right now about the long term side effects of this yet. I will refuse it until more time has passed.
0/0	I‚Äôm scared to get injected because of these ‚Äúallergic reaction‚Äù allegations all over the media!
0/0/0	I‚Äôm sceptical about it due to how fast it‚Äôs been developed, I‚Äôm more worried about long term effects
1/1/1	I‚Äôm scheduled to go get vaccinated this afternoon and the site I‚Äôm going to gives the option between Moderna or J&J. I‚Äôm having anxiety over which to choose!
1/1	I‚Äôm sending this to all my friends who don‚Äôt want to get vaccinated, thank you
1/-1	I‚Äôm sending this to all the Anti-Vaxers in my circle
0/-1	I‚Äôm shocked about people saying they had terrible side effects but were happy! I‚Äôve had HaHb/YelF/Tetanus/ & other inoculations in the past NONE ever gave me trouble but the Covid vaccine I‚Äôm hearing a diff story...is it because it‚Äôs Gene therapy and not a traditional vaccine?
0/0	I‚Äôm sick of being gas lighted when we have been told for over a year to follow the science and now we are being asked to take a vaccine that hasn‚Äôt finished it‚Äôs studies.
0/0	I‚Äôm sitting with covid with 39C fever, fully vaccinated. Very revolutionary things are those vaccines. Waiting for the comments with an explanation that the vaccine does not prevent from sickness and so on. But in that case I would not call it a revolution.
1/1	I‚Äôm skeptical that those who are anti-vaccine truly understand the risk/benefit ratio paradigm.
1/1	I‚Äôm so glad I got my vaccine. I had symptoms after the second dose and it was a rough 12 hours, but I‚Äôd planned the day off. I had Gatorade and Tylenol at the ready, and 36 hours after the vaccine I felt perfectly normal. Later that day I took a 5 mile walk! I work at my hospital‚Äôs covid vaccine clinic, and a lot of people are back at work and feeling fine the day after their vaccine.
1/1	I‚Äôm so glad I got vaccination yesterday..
1/-1	I‚Äôm so glad this video exist now I can explain to my friends and family why it was so fast
1/1	I‚Äôm so happy I pushed myself this week with my workout and work! I got the 2nd covid-19 vaccine on Thursday and was so sick with every side-effect. I only missed one workout on Friday! So I count that as a win!!
1/1	I‚Äôm so happy that we‚Äôre getting back to normal, ain‚Äôt seen my family in 13 months, let‚Äôs fucking go planet earth
1/1	I‚Äôm so happy you made this video! I can‚Äôt wait till I can get vaccinated and help continue to do my part thank you for everything you‚Äôre doing! Stay safe!!

1/1	I‚Äôm so proud of my fellow healthcare workers. We cannot die doing this anymore.
1/1	I‚Äôm so proud of our @A2schools nurses for giving vaccine shots to special ed (self contained) classroom teachers today. Their calm & reassuring words helped everyone!
1/1	I‚Äôm so sick of people citing cases of people getting Covid while vaxxed as some sort of evidence of why they shouldn‚Äôt get the vaccine. Vaccines don‚Äôt necessarily stop transmission BUT they do SAVE LIVES.
1/1	I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss but please understand that it is still possible to contact COVID after the first vaccine. You have to get the second one for reliable immunity. Her death was from COVID, not the vaccine. It is impossible to contract Covid from the vaccine. I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss but please don‚Äôt put your own life at risk out of grief.
1/1	I‚Äôm so thankful that I am in the number of vaccinated.
1/1/1/1	I‚Äôm so very fortunate to be in a job/position that allowed for access to the COVID-19 vaccine. I am so thankful and after nearly a year of worry, RELIEVED
1/1	I‚Äôm sorry all the thousands of doctors and scientists in the world don‚Äôt have time to come and see you and tell you the vaccines are safe. Consider that they are all a lot smarter than you and they get vaccinated.
0/0	I‚Äôm sorry but any parent who takes their healthy child for a covid vaccine at this stage is mental.
1/0	I‚Äôm sorry but are people being contrarian for the sake of it? Does anyone actually have a problem with mandatory vaccinations?
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	I‚Äôm still not getting vaccinated.
0	I‚Äôm still not gonna take it, I don‚Äôt trust a vaccine that has been made in 9 months, when its supposed to take 5-10 years to even make and get trusted
0/-1	I‚Äôm still waiting for any of them to die from COVID. Apparently it‚Äôs the greatest pandemic ever, but Hollywood is basically immune. Not one big name celebrity under 60‚Ä¶
1/1	I‚Äôm such a nice guy. I got vaccinated so that those unvaccinated can have a hospital bed if they need one. You can thank me later.
1/1	I‚Äôm surprised people are skeptical about the vaccine. I‚Äôm the only one at my work said I‚Äôll be down taking once it is available to us.
1/1	I‚Äôm taking it,
1/1	I‚Äôm taking mine in a few weeks, I know it will be a huge relief when they have both shots.
1/1	I‚Äôm taking my first dose on Friday :)
1/1	I‚Äôm taking my parents to get their first shots tmrw (Moderna) and can‚Äôt wait. Today, three managers (also seniors) I work with got their shots today.
0/0	I‚Äôm taking my responsibility to be part of the solution seriously. I have a healthy lifestyle, eat a clean diet with real food, take good quality supplements especially vitamins C, D and zinc. I don‚Äôt watch the news and stay away from criminal corrupt governments and Big Pharma companies like Pfizer who received the largest criminal fine in US history ($2.3 billion). But I can‚Äôt wait to get my depopulating untested gene therapy shot of toxins, after all the U.K. government Yellow Card reporting as of May 2021 says deaths are ONLY up to 1100 and adverse reactions nearly 800,000. That is estimated between 1-10% of total reactions. Such a tiny chance of anything going wrong so line up folks roll your sleeves up your government cares about you‚Ä¶
1/1	I‚Äôm taking the vaccine since a lot of people do.
1/1	I‚Äôm thankful my covid course has been mild and I owe it all to my God-given natural immunity‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ that was primed and ready to go thanks to 3 shots of the widely distributed and extremely safe and effective vaccine.
0/0	I‚Äôm thinking it may reduce cognitive function, because they keep going back for more boosters of the same stuff that didn‚Äôt previously work
1/1	I‚Äôm thrilled to say that I got my first COVID vaccine dose today! College Station opened its vaccine hub today (which works great!) and I got the call as someone in phase 1b So proud to do my part to prevent the spread of COVID-19! #VaccinesWork
1/1	I‚Äôm tired of so many people saying they get sick from getting such and such vaccine so they don‚Äôt get it. Getting a little achy or sore means your immune system worked and you will likely be safer now.
0/0	I‚Äôm tired of them talking like everyone is gonna take it. I wanna hear about when I don‚Äôt take it.
1/1	I‚Äôm tired. If everyone would vax this garbage would be over in the US.
1/1	I‚Äôm totally down to get a vaccine and go outside while they hide.
0/0	I‚Äôm trusting my immune system against the 99% virus.

0/0	I‚Äôm unvaccinated, my immediate family is unvaccinated and I will NEVER require my staff to vaccinate.
1/1	I‚Äôm usually a bit cynical, but these scientists with their decisive actions saved a lot of lives.
1/1	I‚Äôm vaccinated and boosted. Got Covid. Didn‚Äôt die.
1/1	I‚Äôm vaccinated fully now & so is my Grandmother (she‚Äôs 100 years young) she‚Äôll celebrate her 101th birthday in September Thank you Mr. President
1/1	I‚Äôm vaccinated!
1/1	I‚Äôm vaccinated, so is my entire personals web of friends and family. It‚Äôs is sooo hard to feel bad for people who cling to a cult, and to forgo doctors and scientist advice against their own detriment‚Ä¶
0/0	I‚Äôm vaccinated- got Covid really bad. I don‚Äôt need a booster!!! I‚Äôm the only person in my family that got vaccinated and I had it worse then everyone who isn‚Äôt vaccinated. I was down for more then 2 weeks. They all bounced back within 4 days. It was horrible.
0/0	I‚Äôm vaccine hesitant because there‚Äôs no way its been properly vetted.
1/1	I‚Äôm very compromised and will be high on the list for the vaccine in Canada. I‚Äôve been scared. I‚Äôm less so now.
1/1	I‚Äôm very glad you got it! I a CAT scan tech in the same boat. It‚Äôs been a very long year. I was supposed to have gotten my vaccine yesterday but Tuesday I tested positive for covid. Survived 10 months just to get it 5 days before my vaccine lol. Terrible luck. On the upside, I‚Äôm doing ok. I‚Äôm pretty sure I got it from work as my and my wife literally do nothing else so I hope everyone on the frontline can get it ASAP.
1/1	I‚Äôm very pro science, pro doctor (pro vaccine) etc. But we have to be willing to admit past failures.
1/1	I‚Äôm waiting now for my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. 5 more weeks to go.
0/0	I‚Äôm willing to be part of the control group that doesn‚Äôt get the vaccine!
0/0	I‚Äôm willing to die for my right to refuse
0/0/0/0	I‚Äôm willing to die for my right to refuse, are you willing to die trying to make me???
0/0	I‚Äôm willing to move schools for something I believe in too I would rather have COVID than the actual Vaccine
1/1	I‚Äôm willing to take the minute it is available so that I can live a normal life soon and hopefully trigger others in my circle to follow suit.
0/0	I‚Äôm with Craig on this and so is more than 50% of Australians. The vaccine is misinformation and dangerous , good luck being a GMO! Kill Gates openly admits it! seriously I am shocked how misinformed politicians are, either that or they‚Äôre just following orders?
0/0	I‚Äôm with themgood on them !! I‚Äôm not an anti vaxer but I will not be forced to have a ‚Äúso called‚Äù vaccine against my will..... it has not been tested enough ! Common sense !!
0/1	I‚Äôm worried about getting coronavirus whilst getting the vaccine
0/-1	I‚Äôm worried of a multi dose vaccine being drawn up correctly in the syringe. In particular if none medical staff are giving this injection. Accuracy is absolutely important. Too much could kill, not enough is no good.
0/0	I‚Äôm young and I‚Äôm healthy and I have no pre-existing conditions and I‚Äôm not taking that damn vaccine
1/-1	I‚Äôm young and work out everyday honestly every fat person needs it and the elderly
0/0	I‚Äôve Never received the flu shot and will not be receiving covid shot either! I‚Äôm not worried about a cough; I‚Äôm worried about a cop! More blacks are being killed by cops not Covid!!
0/0	I‚Äôve already recovered from covid and we don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôll throw our immune system into overdrive from it
0	I‚Äôve been feeling extremely tired all yesterday and today and I slept for 10 hours last night only to find out that it‚Äôs a side effect of the vaccine bruh I have a quiz on Monday I need to study for
1/-1	I‚Äôve been having this dream nightly that one day we wake up and COVID is gone. I go to bed hopeful each night. What a dream come true this would be.
1/1	I‚Äôve been hearing from a lot of folks out there telling me they are on the fence about getting the Covid vaccine. They ask me ‚ÄúHill, are you doing it?‚Äù If you‚Äôve already gotten your shot(s) great! And if you are on the fence check out this video as remember there are millions of people around the world that died lonely and painful deaths from Covid. Each and every one of them would trade places with us in an instant to have the opportunity to get vaccinated. And you are not only helping to protect yourself but also helping to protect others by reducing spread. And lastly, thank you so much to all of our frontline healthcare workers! I‚Äôm proud to have the opportunity to play one on our show and thank you for all the work you‚Äôve done to save lives and keep people safe.
0/0	I‚Äôve been hesitant to take any of them but recently thought about taking the J&J. I‚Äôm back to not taking any of them.
1/1	I‚Äôve been shielding and received my Covid jab, I currently have the chills, a headache , I‚Äôm tired but can‚Äôt sleep, I feel ill but it‚Äôs worth it. I know it‚Äôs my immune system working hard. To those who don‚Äôt want to get it, fine. But don‚Äôt spoil it for us.
1/1	I‚Äôve been so nervous to take my vaccine I finally took it yesterday! Feel like poop but it‚Äôs passing . The first day is the worst for me hope tomorrow is better
0/0	I‚Äôve been telling a lot of people, friends, family and strangers, before this so-called vaccine came out, that It‚Äôs not safe! You need 3 to 5 years for study, at least! This was a rush job! Anytime you rush anything, it is bound to fail! You don‚Äôt rush anything that involves someone‚Äôs health or life! As far as seeing officials on television, and even hear about the president himself, receiving the vaccine, those shots could‚Äôve been just a placebo, and not the real deal! And even if it were, what they receive is totally different than what you receive! This COVID-19 virus was formulated to control the population! And this COVID vaccine (The Guyana tragedy Reverend Jim Jones Kool-Aid cocktail!) could just finish off what the COVID-19 virus could not, against the people who are not infected, and possibly naturally immune to some strains of the virus! And now, I am hearing that hospitals are intentionally putting non-Covid patients in the same room with infected Covid patients, in order to spread the pandemic, so they can put these patients on a ventilator, which will in turn provide a tidy sum of around $30,000 plus dollars from the federal government per person! One New York nurse exposed a hospital in New York by secretly filming inside the hospital showing the corruption that went on there! Here is the link‚Ä¶https://youtu.be/8VFngRmp1HE If they are doing it there in New York, you can bet your bottom dollar they‚Äôre doing it elsewhere in the United States Of America! Don‚Äôt take my word for it! Do your own research! Hospitals are a scary place to go nowadays! Even if you just go in for something as little as a sprained finger or a dog bite, there is a lot of risk visiting a hospital! You don‚Äôt know who has what! And it‚Äôs also scary to know, the doctors that you trust and depend on with your life, could betray you and set you up, in order to make a buck! Back in the old days, doctors use to care about their patients! Not anymore! All they care about, are Benjamin Franklin‚Äôs! They will prescribe medications for you that you don‚Äôt even need, or have a high risk of negative side effects, that is even more dangerous than your ailment! But don‚Äôt get me wrong! There are some good doctors out there, but It‚Äôs like finding a needle in a haystack, so to speak. No pun intended! :-)
1/1	I‚Äôve been to Mississippi a few times and it‚Äôs a unique, beautiful place. Delta Blues, catfish and hush puppies, cool wetter at least as compared to truly sweltering New Orleans across Lake Pontchartrain. Whether you‚Äôre white, black or red, my Mississippian brethren, please: get vaxxed. Doesn‚Äôt sound like it‚Äôs a supply/access problem but a demand/personal decision problem
1/1	I‚Äôve been vaccinated. My side effects were minimal (a sore arm and mild flu like symptoms for a couple of days). My sense of increased personal and family safety greatly outweighs those symptoms. Here‚Äôs how I made my decision. I chose to trust the medical professionals and scientists who did the research over the past couple of decades that allowed a vaccine to be developed. I chose to trust the medical professionals and scientists who created the vaccine. I chose to trust the medical professionals and scientists who ran multiple tests of various dosages of the vaccine to determine whether it was effective, whether it produced unacceptable side effects, etc. I chose to trust the medical professionals and scientists at the FDA and the CDC who analyzed all of the studies done before approving the vaccines for use on the public. I chose not to trust paid political commentators who say, without evidence, that the vaccine is not safe just to generate angst, political gain, and personal wealth.
1/1	I‚Äôve been vaccinated. One step closer to a normal life I hope
0/0	I‚Äôve done research and I‚Äôm choosing to pass. Respect that please.
1	I‚Äôve got mine! be sure you get yours!
1/1/1	I‚Äôve got my first Pfizer vaccine, I have a immune disorder, asthma and smoked for 20 years but quit 6 months ago. I had no difficulty at all on first vaccine. I‚Äôll be getting second in less than 3 weeks.
1/1	I‚Äôve gotten 2 vaccine shots and I‚Äôm perfectly fine, I won‚Äôt listen to influencers like that. Also, I‚Äôll still be wearing my mask just to be on the safe side.
0/-1	I‚Äôve gotten a flu vaccine, A month ago and I feel like I‚Äôm going to regret it. I just learned how bad the flu vaccine was after I got it. I‚Äôm spiritual and have been aware of the toxic covid 19 vaccine. Honesty I don‚Äôt feel like my usual self. I am currently detoxing from it. Should I just let go of this fear? I really hope I have not messed up my DNA.
1/1	I‚Äôve gotten enough info to know that it‚Äôs fine. I will take my chance and get it.
0/0	I‚Äôve gotten enough info to know that it‚Äôs too risky and sus to take it this early
1/1	I‚Äôve had a dose of moderna yesterday and feel a little off, and my shoulder is pretty sore. But it‚Äôs all part of your immune system working. If you don‚Äôt get the vaccine, you‚Äôre just contributing to the problem and COVID will never die off.
1/1	I‚Äôve had a recent history with some bad lungs issues so I‚Äôm happy that I‚Äôve finally started this process. GET VACCINATED, FRIENDS! SAVE LIVES.
1/1	I‚Äôve had both my Pfizer vaccines. I got my second one on the 6th July.
0/0	I‚Äôve had both my vaccines but what‚Äôs the point when new variety escapes it?
1/1	I‚Äôve had both of my doses. So grateful!
1/1/1	I‚Äôve had both, husband‚Äôs had one and we‚Äôre encouraged by this news for our children!
0/0	I‚Äôve had covid and a natural immunity. I‚Äôm a senior and the survival rate is 98.6% Those are good odds. I have boosted my immune system from day one and would suggest everyone else do the same. At best, covid and other Sars vaccines are minimally effective and some of the ingredients are propietory, so you don‚Äôt know what you are putting into your body. It is still a clinical trial and everyone that gets it is basically a guinea pig. The Sars will keep adapting which we‚Äôve known all along so you‚Äôll be told you‚Äôll need endless boosters. No thanks.
0/0	I‚Äôve had every vaccine but this one. How does that make one anti-vaccine?
0/0	I‚Äôve had many blood clots and I am on medication to stop them . I got Covid and NOT one blood clot . No vaccine for me I am immune now .

1/1	I‚Äôve had my first Moderna shot, looking forward to the second.
0/1	I‚Äôve had my vaccines but governments mandating vaccines makes me suspicious and nervous
1/1/1/1	I‚Äôve had people decline the Covid vaccine because someone they know felt unwell after theirs It‚Äôs ENTIRELY normal to get a temp, headache, sore arm or feel a bit run down after the vaccine: it‚Äôs your immune system responding well to it It‚Äôs SO MUCH better than getting Covid
0/0	I‚Äôve had pretty full on side effects over the last 24hours since having the Astra Zeneca Oxford vaccine which I‚Äôve reported via yellow card system in case they have been heighten by the medication I‚Äôm on (Zoladex, ibandronic acid, Letrozole)
0/0	I‚Äôve had terrible reaction to flu shot not sure I want to chance this vaccine
1/1	I‚Äôve had the first injection of the vaccine about 2 weeks ago and I currently feel great
1/1	I‚Äôve had the first shot of the Moderna vaccine, as have many colleagues and friends of mine. I had a mildly sore arm. Others felt tired the day after, or mildly under the weather (such as with a cold). No one I have talked with or heard from has had any serious side effects.
1/1/1	I‚Äôve had the vaccine last week and I‚Äôm doing great no reaction at all...waiting for the 2nd doze
0/0	I‚Äôve heard a lot of negative things about the Covid vaccine
1/1	I‚Äôve heard many people say they don‚Äôt want to be the 1st in line to take a new vaccine. They‚Äôd rather wait & see how it goes for other people. They ought to know that some of us have been vaccinated for a year already! My health has been monitored around the clock ‚Äì no issues.
0/0	I‚Äôve heard of the vaccines messing up a lot of woman‚Äôs menstrual cycles. If it‚Äôs doing that to hormones then I don‚Äôt need that happening to me.
0/0	I‚Äôve heard that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine contains aborted baby cells. Won‚Äôt be taking vaccine
1/1	I‚Äôve just had my first Covid Vaccination. Flexed biceps, Like most, I was a little nervous beforehand. But I believe in the Scientists, I trust the NHS and it‚Äôs one step closer back to normality. Heart suit
1/1	I‚Äôve just realised that the only people I‚Äôve hugged since last March are my cats. Hopefully the #vaccination will mean I can have a #hug with other people I love
0/0	I‚Äôve made it this far without it so I‚Äôm taking my chances without it!
0/0	I‚Äôve never been afraid to get vaccinated or vaccinate my children. It‚Äôs the agenda behind the vaccine that makes people scared! I have never been pressured into the flu shot! It‚Äôs always been our choice. It should be the same with the Covid vaccine!! 99% Survial rate! I‚Äôll take my chances when it‚Äôs not even approved by the FDA!
0/1	I‚Äôve never been so excited to get a vaccine
1/1	I‚Äôve never been so happy in my life to have a bandaid on my arm. Vaccinated finally!
1/1	I‚Äôve never been so happy to get a vaccine
1/1/1/1/1/1	I‚Äôve never been this excited to get stabbed in my life
1/1	I‚Äôve never bothered with the flu vaccine, I am 71, but decided to have the Covid vaccine as I am desperate to have camping holidays this year when last year many campsites remained closed all year. The Powys vaccine centre I attended today was very well organised.
1/-1	I‚Äôve never had a flu jab before as I never get sick but I think this is the right thing to do for the benefit of everyone. I‚Äôll not be the first to take vaccine but I will take it.
1/1	I‚Äôve never had any struggle with vaccines, been taking them and literally no side effects!
0/-1	I‚Äôve never trusted doctors and I never will. They‚Äôre mindless drones that get filled with bullshit in med school
0/0	I‚Äôve not had it no way or my family All the people that listen to them and had jabs big big noooo
0/0	I‚Äôve played WAAAY too much resident evil. If I take this vaccine, will I become a zombie? I‚Äôd rather be fighting zombies than become one.
0/-1	I‚Äôve read that getting the vaccine is contraindicated if you have an allergy to propylene glycol
1/1	I‚Äôve received my first dose on the 27th of March and get my second on the 24th of April and my husband is set to get his first dose on the 7th. It would be awesome if our children were also able to receive a vaccine, our oldest is the only one who would qualify with the age restriction of 12. ü§ûüèΩ
1/1	I‚Äôve said it my whole life: people typically don‚Äôt care until something affects their life. It‚Äôs such a shame that our education system let these people down so badly that they can‚Äôt comprehend basic science. They don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs in their foods, medications, nicotine products‚Ä¶ but won‚Äôt take a vaccine. Our poor healthcare workers must be at the end of their rope.
0/0	I‚Äôve seen articles were they are claiming that people who got the shot and died are dying of ‚ÄúThe New Variant‚Äù
1	I‚Äôve seen some comments that say your chances of an adverse reaction from the vaccine are higher than the risk of death from the virus, so they‚Äôre willing to take their chances and not get vaccinated. It‚Äôs maddening.
0/0	I‚Äôve spent the last 5 years fighting to reverse years of damage by over a decade of pharmaceutical use; I will NOT take this jab willingly. I can‚Äôt understand why a 95% survival rate justifies the risk. God help us all!
1/1	I‚Äôve taken the vaccine and I‚Äôm completely fine. All I felt was muscle pain on my arm for a day or two.
1/1	I‚Äôve told my anti-vaxx family members we cannot see each other unless and until they are all fully vaccinated.
0/0	I‚Äùm rolling my sleeve up as we speak...NOT!

1/1	John is talking about a peer reviewed paper which shows massive benefits to getting vaccinated. He clearly states there are massive benefits to getting vaccinated multiple times.

1/1	Johnson & Johnson submits for emergency use authorization from FDA. This is a huge gamechanger to have a single-dose vaccine with easy storage that appears based on preliminary results to prevent severe disease‚Äî& critically, hospitalizations & deaths
0/0	Johnson and Johnson are bringing out a vaccine now? Didn't they get took to court about talcum powder causing ovarian cancer?
1/1	Johnson and Johnson must share their vaccine with other companies so we have only 1 dose vaccine. National security. Stop making the 2 dose and have 10 companies making the 1 dose vaccine will solve the time problem. Be smarter
0/0	Johnson and Johnson was just paused by the CDC and FDA.... Probably best to not push it right now. Remember the baby powder with asbestos that they sold?
0/0	Johnson's words today are part of the global 'Build Back Better' Cabal with Justin Trudeau saying lockdowns are needed as vaccines are not enough. The hoax has been revealed - they all copy each other

0/0	Jonas Salk the doctor who created the polio vaccine was a supporter of eugenics! He said vaccines could be used to create cancers and test on humans mrna. Don't believe me???

Go read the book and will be more than happy to give citations upon your request.

1/1	Just a friendly reminder, the vaccine can't make you sick. The mRNA vaccines, which doesn‚Äôt contain the virus (Pfizer & Moderna) causes your body to mount a significant immune response to create antibodies. The symptoms you experience afterwards, such as headache, fever, soreness, and fatigue, are side effects from your immune system kicking into gear. ùêíùê®ùê¶ùêû ùê©ùêûùê®ùê©ùê•ùêû ùê°ùêöùêØùêû ùê´ùêûùê©ùê®ùê´ùê≠ùêûùêù ùê¨ùê≠ùê´ùê®ùêßùê†ùêûùê´ ùê¨ùê¢ùêùùêû ùêûùêüùêüùêûùêúùê≠ùê¨ ùêöùêüùê≠ùêûùê´ ùê≠ùê°ùêûùê¢ùê´ ùê¨ùêûùêúùê®ùêßùêù ùêùùê®ùê¨ùêûùê¨ ùê∞ùê¢ùê≠ùê° ùêßùê® ùê©ùê´ùêûùêØùê¢ùê®ùêÆùê¨ ùêûùê±ùê©ùê®ùê¨ùêÆùê´ùêû ùê≠ùê® ùêúùê®ùêØùê¢ùêù. ùêÉùê®ùêß'ùê≠ ùêüùê´ùêûùêöùê§ ùê®ùêÆùê≠ ùê¢ùêü ùê≤ùê®ùêÆ ùê†ùêûùê≠ ùê≠ùê°ùêûùê¨ùêû ùê¨ùê¢ùêùùêû ùêûùêüùêüùêûùêúùê≠ùê¨ ùêüùê´ùê®ùê¶ ùêö ùêÇùê®ùêØùê¢ùêù-ùüèùüó ùêØùêöùêúùêúùê¢ùêßùêû. ùêìùê°ùêûùê≤ ùêúùêöùêß ùêöùêúùê≠ùêÆùêöùê•ùê•ùê≤ ùêõùêû ùêö ùê†ùê®ùê®ùêù ùê¨ùê¢ùê†ùêß.

1/-1	Just a heads up - I (33F) got my 2nd Moderna shot earlier this week and it knocked me out for a good 36 hours - had fever, bodyaches, etc. Arm was sore for about 48 hours. Still worth it!
1/1	Just a lil personal experience but I got covid at 17 and I am someone with a very weak immune system and autoimmune illnesses, so when covid hit me I straight up was almost hospitalized. I'm doing so much better now and I have my covid vaccines. I really wish ppl could actually give a fuck about this virus bc ppl like me are most affected by their dumb actions
1/-1	Just a little tip for people who are scared of needles. Give a good hearty cough as the needle pierces the skin and you won't feel a thing. This really works, so ask the nurse to tell you 'when'.
1/1	Just a reminder 1.) COVID vaccines are performing extremely well, and 2.) the continued rampage of the virus is almost ENTIRELY due to conservatives telling their marks a.) vaccines don't work or are Soros-microchip satanism or b.) their "freedom" demands they not get the shots
0/0	Just a reminder of what the corporate media is not reporting. This is a very moving testimony on dangers of this experimental not fully licensed covid vaccine...
0	Just a reminder of who owns the patent to this virus and its supposed cure. No liability for permanent harm, death, infertility or long term effects. No test. They say you need it every 6 months and still need to wear a mask......tell me another lie.
1/1	Just a reminder that 554,000 American souls have died from #COVID19 #Vaccinate #WearAMask
1/-1	Just a reminder, in the 2018-19 flu season, 224 people died. 1,153 have died of covid-19 in the last 7 days
0/0	Just a simple question for everyone, since when did the government start caring for your health?
0/1	Just a skosh of nausea in the middle of the night, achiness, and fatigue. Not bad at all.
1/1	Just a sore arm for a few days like you get from any vaccination. Much better than getting Covid!
0/0	Just a splash of aborted fetal cells, animal cells, DNA altering rmna, aluminum (known to cause Alzheimer‚Äôs), mercury, formaldehyde, and many other nefarious ingredients that if I spoon fed them to my child I would be in jail. But it‚Äôs ok to pump this straight into they system bypassing the immune system?
1/0	Just about a year from this video's publication and this vaccine was administered to me. Modern science is incredible. Stay in school kids.
1/1	Just actually got my shot a couple hours ago of typing this I feel a little sore in my shoulder but everything is fine. Go Science!
0/0	Just another crap to cover up on why high number of infections come from vaccinated people
0/0	Just another reminder to all my unvaxxed brethren: HOLD THE F@CKING LINE!!!
0/-1	Just another way to control and manipulate humans.
0/0	Just ask Hank Aaron about the vaccine ‚ÄúOh you can‚Äôt‚Äù he died just 14 day‚Äôs later
0/0	Just avoid getting any of the vaccines. You‚Äôre going to have to get it every year anyhow. Just have your immune system handle it instead of being poisoned by what‚Äôs in that crap. Stop being guinea pigs.
1	Just bc it fast doesn't mean it's unsafe
0/0	Just because FDA approval, doesn't mean it's safe.
0/0	Just because some people are stupid enough to fall for this doesn't mean everybody is!!!
1/1	Just because someone dies after they had a vaccine doesn‚Äôt mean the vaccine caused it. I‚Äôve had mine and will die some day but it won‚Äôt have caused my death.
0/0	Just because someone doesn‚Äôt want to take an experimental vaccine that has no long term trials and no avenue for compensation if something were to go wrong doesn‚Äôt mean they are anti science and against all medicine, everyone just wants to shove people into little boxes, no more individuals with individual choices. Should I be able to decide what car you can buy or what foods you can eat? What a bunch of mini dictators people are turning into. You should leave that man alone if he doesn‚Äôt want the vaccine, aren‚Äôt you safe from him anyway being a vaccinated, double masking, social distancing sociopath?
0/0	Just because the celebrities are doing it doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm going to do it too
1/1	Just because ur child doesn't react well to a vaccine, doesn't mean u should be forcing other people not to get one
1/1	Just because you don‚Äôt understand something doesn‚Äôt mean its okay to bash it like you are. These vaccines will be responsible for saving hundreds of thousands of lives, so I think that people can handle being sick for a day or two to make that happen.
1/1/1/1/1	Just because you have an adverse reaction to vaccines doesn‚Äôt mean nobody should get vaccines
0/0	Just because you havnt grown a 2nd nose yet, doesn't mean that you are in the clear. It still changes your DNA.
0	Just because yu got it and was okay doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not safe for other people yu are one person in a billion‚Ä¶..
1/1	Just been offered my first Covid vaccine. Finally something good this year!!!
1/1	Just booked my first and second jabs. Happy Days.
1/1	Just booked my mums covid vaccination and I could absolutely jump for joy
1/1	Just booked my vaccine today
1/1	Just by leaving those who are anti-vaxers and anti-maskers alone, will by natural selection make America great again.
0/0	Just claim it's against your religion and youre all set.
1/1	Just concentrate on rolling out the vaccination programme
1/0	Just divert a small fraction of the military funding to fight this virus with tests and tracing and we could prevent far many more deaths to our citizens than whatever we are spending that money on.
0/0	Just don't get the vaccine the CDC doesn't even support it.
0/0	Just don't take it. Not cure and no guarantee. Why risk your life.
0/0	Just eat organic and exercise build up your natural immune system and live long and healthy, no need for vaccine!
1/1	Just finished up my second Moderna shot. Lets keep it going
1/1	Just finished up my second Moderna shot. Lets keep it going.
1/1	Just found out my dad and brother-in-law are getting the #CovidVaccine today. My dad (and mum) have been shielding for nearly a year. The wave of relief flowing over me right now is like nothing else
1/1	Just found out today that both my parents are FINALLY getting their first #COVIDVaccine shot at the end of April!
1/-1	Just found your video. Thanks for all the links/explanations. I have been countering myths and misinformation regarding SARS-CoV-2 on numerous channels. (It can be somewhat exhausting at times.) Your video will be of great use in that regard.
1/1	Just from scrolling through the comments and reading the reasons not to take it makes me want to take it more.
1/1	Just get Vaccine out fast so who ever want the vaccine can get it slow this Pandemic down and slow the spread and do what Doctors have suggested and give vaccine to the most Vulnerable like Senior Citizen and pre-existing illness people
1/1	Just get it, theres more harmful crap in all the food we eat.

1/1	Just get the vaccine for gods sake
1/1/1	Just get the vaccine guys..
1/1	Just get the vaccine! The sooner everyone gets it the sooner we out of this Pandemic!
1/1	Just get the vaccine. What risks are there? You want people to stop telling you to put your mask on right. You want this to be over right? How do you think we got rid of smallpox? Hmmmm? Exactly. If we all just do our part we can be done with this virus that is clearly real as we can see. Just because the death rate is really low does not mean you are safe. You can still get long term side effects from this virus. Like unhealthy lungs. Ok, so just don‚Äôt be stupid and be smart. You either get the vaccine and do your part or you put everybody around you at risk and be selfish.
1/1	Just get vaccinated

1/1	Just got Pfizer dose 2. In 2 weeks I‚Äôm going on a vacation for the first time in almost a year and a half.

1/1	Just got back from getting my second dose! So happy, looking forward to hugging my grandkids!
0/0	Just got covid confirmed 2 days ago. I dont want to take the vaccine and still wont even after this omicron. Wasnt bad at all for me how i thought. Not scared if i get it again even if it gets stronger my body is used to getting well.
1/1/1	Just got home from filming and was blessed to be able to recieve my first #vaccine shot!
1/1	Just got it today!Ok, so as a healthcare worker, I will admit that I feel something of an obligation to get the shot, if only to help protect the patients I interact with every day. But, beyond that, as a pharmacist who has read the EUA‚Äôs (emergency use authorizations) for both the Moderna and the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID vaccines, I can tell you I have a lot of confidence in both of these vaccines. Confidence that they are safe, and confidence that they work really well to prevent me from getting (and transmitting) COVID-19.
1/1	Just got it today, I‚Äôm just happy to finally be able to get past this virus at long last
1/-1	Just got mine I? still feeling good just sore like a flu shot
1/-1	Just got mine last night. I can confirm strong craving for brains. Also cheetos.

1/1	Just got my 1st dose about 30mins ago! I was one of those ppl who questioned it immensely and waited till the last minute. Glad I got it. I feel a sense of relief
1/1	Just got my 1st dose of the Pfizer Vaccine today! Lets all get vaccinated guys
1/1	Just got my 1st jab by Comirnaty Pfizer-BioNTech after fighting with my company because they forced me to be injected by Sinovac. Couldn't be happier today

1/1	Just got my 2nd dose of Pfizer today.
1/1	Just got my Pfizer booster at St Thomas's. I'm under 40, 5 months from 2nd shot. Walk in, super easy, no questions asked! Waited about 5 minutes. Incredible service.
1/1	Just got my first COVID vaccine and it makes me so happy to know that soon I‚Äôll be able to hug my nana again
1/1	Just got my first Moderna dose! I had mild side affects the first two days, then I felt completely normal. Totally worth it so that we can reduce the spread and hopefully get closer to normal this year!
1/1	Just got my first corona vaccine. Things are looking up!
1/1	Just got my first does of vaccine at my local walgreens. I didn't feel any pain, just a little warm
1/1	Just got my first dose here in India.
1	Just got my first dose of the Covid vaccine today. Remember to get the vaccine to help our healthcare workers that have sacrificed so much for all of us over the past year. And take time to thank a healthcare worker today. It takes a very special person to do what they do.
1/1	Just got my first dose of the Moderna vaccine today, woohoo!
1/1	Just got my first dose of the Moderna vaccine today. Everything went fine. Just some slight burning and a slight cold feeling in my arm during the vaccination. My arm is getting more sore as the day goes on.
1/1	Just got my first dose of the vaccine! So excited.
1/1	Just got my first dose today!
1/1	Just got my first dose yesterday. Already set for shot number 2 on April 27th
1/1	Just got my first dose yesterday. Get vaccinated, people!
1/1	Just got my first dose yesterday. Honestly for side effects all I've had is some arm pain but that should be anticipated with any vaccine. I would encourage people to take it as I got it and I'm perfectly alright. As the video explained ( if you watched it ) that the vaccine makes your body produce the spike protein so if you ever do catch Coronavirus your body should fight it off. I'm going to get my second dose on 2/11/21. What I think is messed up is people fearing the one thing that could end the pandemic than the virus itself.
1/1	Just got my first dose! My arm isn? even sore!
1/1	Just got my first dose, stay safe everyone!
1/1	Just got my first dose. Nothing to complain about but maybe some injection site pain but you'd get that with any of them. Stay safe everyone, vaccinated or not.

1/1	Just got my first shot (moderna shot) side effects were pretty mild.
1/-1	Just got my first shot yesterday. Holy fuck I feel terrible today

1/1	Just got my first vaccine shot today at work
1/1	Just got my first! You‚Äôre welcome, Joe.
1/1/1/1/1	Just got my second dose & everything he said is true. Sore arm and little headaches but that's it. It's a small price to pay to stay alive and healthy
1/1	Just got my second dose Friday. My Mother died from Covid. Please everyone get vaccinated.
1/1	Just got my second dose about an hour ago. Get the vaccine guys so we can get back to whatever normal is going to look like
1/1	Just got my second dose of phizer today. Soo, so excited to have probably gotten through this pandemic covidfree
1/1	Just got my second moderna shot yesterday. Feel like shit today but glad to be fully vaccinated finally!
1/1	Just got my second one last week. Nothing but a sore shoulder for both.
1/1	Just got my second vaccine dose today and I am now in bed with body chills and my head is on fire. Felt the symptoms about 10-12 hours later. I cannot wait for this bloody Covid to be over!

1/1	Just got pfizer nothing at all feeling great!! No effects no sore arm
1/1	Just got scheduled for my first dose on Saturday. Very excited!
1/1	Just got shot #2 yesterday. I‚Äôm doing my part. Are you?
1/1/1	Just got some of those sweet, sweet mRNA juices in my left arm. FACT*: If you get a two-shot vaccine and plan for one in each arm, you end up with two COVID-punching arms. If you get both shots in one arm, then that arm can hit COVID twice as hard.
1/1	Just got the J&J shot yesterday. The side effects are real but a good thing. It means my immune system is working
1/1	Just got the Johnson and Johnson and everyone is telling me I should?e waited for another. But I know it doesn? matter
1/1/1/1/1	Just got the Johnson and Johnson and everyone is telling me I should‚Äôve waited for another. But I know it doesn‚Äôt matter

1/1/1/1/1	Just got vaccinated
1/1	Just got vaccinated yesterday ‚≠êÔ∏è‚úä I can say, it‚Äôs legit. I‚Äôm having some of the same mild symptoms (chills, headache) I had when I had covid 8 months ago, so that means my body is working on making those antibodies again.
1/1	Just got vaccinated, I did my part, please do yours
1/1	Just got vaccinated, thank you Pfizer!
1/1	Just got vaccinated. feeling good
1/1	Just got vaccine and here to see the past a dark past that alhamdolilah has passed. Thank you UAE for free vaccineüòä
1/1	Just gotta love these anti-vaxxers who laugh at the suggestion of any vaccine
0/0	Just had 10 minutes to decide whether or not I want to get the #Covid #vaccine today. After careful deliberation: No, hard pass!!
1/1	Just had 2nd shot and there really is a sense of hope and relief although I expect to practice masks and social distancing for a while
1/1	Just had mine (moderna first shot) the only thing I felt was pain in the arm and nothing else no other side effects. My parents first shot ( also Moderna) had no side effects and the second shot mild body aches that lasted for about two days
1/1	Just had mine , so well organised and carried out with super efficient way at Leigh sports village. And no after effects at all
1/1	Just had my 1st @Pfizer_UK #CovidVaccine done at my quacks Face with no drama, very well organised thanked every single doctor, nurse, helper, that was still working @ 20:00 hours this evening to help #SaveLives & I‚Äôm booked in for my final Syringe too.

1/1	Just had my COVID vaccination (I‚Äôm high risk group) and have never felt lighter or more hopeful!
1/1	Just had my Covid vaccine. Very efficient. Almost as fast as vaccinating sheep! Thanks to organisers and indeed to Govt for making the decision early on to order plenty of vaccine.
1/1	Just had my Oxford vaccine. Feeling good
1/1	Just had my booster , sore injection site for 4 days and feeling tired for about 1day . First 2 was quite similar . Most of my friends and family members have a very similar side effects as me . A few did have a bit more severe side effects but only about 1-2% among the people I know .
1/1	Just had my first Astrazeneca dose this evening :)
1/1	Just had my first Moderna Covid vaccine 3 days ago. Side- effects like regular flu shot. Please get protected so we can get back to normal. Remember polio vaccinations? Trust!

1/1	Just had my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine today. So far no ill effects
1/1	Just had my first dose. #Protect yourself #Protect others #CovidVaccine
1/1/1	Just had my first shot, the team handling the process was exceptional!
1/1	Just had my jab. Brilliant work by the NHS staff, it was efficient and the staff were cheerful and reassuring. My advice for what it is worth is get your jab, maintain your social distancing and behave sensibly, and we will beat this.
0/-1	Just had some very sad news.A very dear family friend has passed away a day after having her first vaccination
1/1	Just had the phone call for my Covid vaccination. Beautiful!
0/0	Just heard on the news this evening that people should expect to have to renew the vaccine at least once yearly!! Dread to think what our poor bodies are supposed to do with all the highly toxic substances, aborted feotus cells, chimpanzee cells etc etc that will be floating about from these vaccines!!!
1/1	Just here for the crack pot antivaxer comments
1/1	Just here for the entertainment provided by the anti-vaxers
0/1	Just hope most of the vaccines work. It would be easier and cheaper on global supply chains if every major country or continent can produce its own vaccine. I'm really hoping for the Oxford one in Brazil
0/0	Just identify as ‚Äúvaccinated ‚Äú What are they going to do ? Tell you - your not allowed to believe in something your not ?
1/1	Just ignore them, let them get the virus , we dont need their genes to live with humanity
0/0	Just imagine ... imagine a vaccine so safe you have to be threatened to take it.
0/0	Just imagine everyone will change to zombie
0/0	Just imagine those people who died bc of this vaccine but haven't been reported yet.
1/1	Just imagine where we would be if polititions and pundits, and people in general had behaved like this about the Salk Polio Vaccine. Aka these people who with on farms and regularly with horses whether or not they approve of tetanus vaccine. How about pertussis, whooping cough. Ever seen your child with that? Probably not because you got the vaccine. Use your brain.
0/0	Just keep talking the poison.....
0/1	Just learned I am getting vaccinated on Friday. This feeling is pure happiness and relief... honestly I feel speechless
0/0	Just leave it! We have a God given immunity, thank you so much we don‚Äôt need your poison .
1/1	Just let me take this vaccine soon! I just wanna be safe!
1/1	Just let nature take it's course. When they require hospitalization...they should not get priority over those who got vaccinated....
1/1	Just let the anti vaxxers die off.
0/0	Just like fire all unvaccinated health care workers because the vaccinated healthcare workers are better protected for the most vulnerable but yet vaccinated workers with breakthrough Covid can now return to work after 5 days but the unvaccinated are still more harmful???
0/0	Just like over using antibiotics forces bacteria to mutate, mass use of vaccines force viruses to mutate thus more variants!
0/0/0/0	Just like the FBI/CIA did with the word ‚Äúconspiracist‚Äù they‚Äôre doing the same with with the word ‚Äúanti-Vaxxer‚Äù The fact that all these people are being silenced; it should speak volumes about what‚Äôs going on
0/0	Just like the flu, there will be a new "strain" every year and they'll shoot in the dark and blame citizens for not getting vaccinated enough. Bait and switch.
0/0	Just like the last wonder vaccines that do nothing.
0/0/0	Just like the virus itself, the vaccine can effect everyone differently. Take that with what you will.
1/-1	Just like those that think covid is a hoax are the first ones to get the vaccine
1/-1	Just look back in history in 1952 at polio a record year for polio 57,628 people got polio there is no proof vaccines make people sick or kill people. And for the vaccines cause autism is total crap as person who is on the autism spectrum and can we all remember the doctor who said vaccines caused autism it was found out that the doctor lied on his medical papers about his findings on autism was caused by vaccines let's ask people all the familys of the people who died from polio or people who got polio lived if the polio vaccine is a lie
1/1	Just looking at the number of cases it does appear to be effective at preventing the spread. Hopefully the vaccine cut 10 months off the pandemic and there are no long term consequences or unforeseen side effects down the road.
1/1	Just mail me my vaccine, like voting. I don't want to stand in line. I'll take it myself.
1/1	Just make it mandatory.
1/0	Just make vaccines non optional and free, for fucks sake
0/-1	Just met my next door neighbour who has had the Corona jab and the flu jab and she said both her and her husband have had a chesty cold since before Christmas. This happens to them every year after the flu jab. Talk about doing the same thing over and over expecting a different outcome. Some years they have been really bad and why they do it is beyond me. Pumping yourself full of man made vaccines can not do your natural immune system any good in fact it could ultimately destroy it.
0/1	Just note how remarkable has been the development process for vaccines. This normally takes years or many many months: we now have 3 tested vaccine candidates at advanced trials stage
0/0	Just passing this on I have carefully studied the development of the covid vaccines and many things about them are very concerning to me: First of all, up until this point there has never been any successful vaccine for coronaviruses in humans due to a problem typical of coronavirus vaccine development called antibody dependent enhancement or ADE. [1] In preliminary animal trials for previous coronavirus vaccines (SARS and MERS), animals were vaccinated and seemed to exhibit a robust antibody response, but upon exposure to the wild virus, they developed a paradoxical immune enhancement leading to severe organ inflammation (especially in lungs), and they died. [2][3] Paradoxical immune response in coronavirus vaccines has also taken place in human trials, which occurred during testing of the failed RSV vaccines of the 1950s. [4] Alarmingly, there are some statistical indications of ADE in covid vaccine trials, but there is no way to know for sure because many key signifiers of ADE weren‚Äôt specifically addressed. [5] Due to emergency protocol, the usual method of testing animals prior to humans was bypassed, limited animal testing occurred in parallel with humans, and the potential for ADE was not comprehensively assessed. [6] [7] Historical precedent would suggest, however, that ADE is a distinct possibility, and we may not know the true negative effects until years from now when vaccinated persons are exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or genetically similar versions of coronavirus. [8] Second, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines contain lipid nanoparticles that are ‚ÄúPEGylated‚Äù, meaning the nanoparticles are coated with PEG (polyethylene glycol).[9] PEGs can lead to life threatening anaphylaxis or other conditions such as thrombocytopenia. [10] [50] Such reactions are already occurring during the initial vaccine rollout and PEGs are the most likely culprit. [11] Approximately 72% of the US population have PEG antibodies, with 8% having extremely elevated levels (more than 500 ng/mL), putting them at risk for severe allergic reaction and/or future autoimmune disorders. [12] These reactions were totally predictable, with many experts warning of the danger posed by PEGs [13][14][15], yet participants with a history of severe allergic reaction were excluded from the trials, serving to obscure the actual negative impact PEGs will have now that these vaccines are being given to members of the public who have not been screened for PEG antibodies. [16] Also, there is some worrying evidence to suggest that PEGs cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in the brain, possibly causing inflammation and/or autoimmune conditions, a fact gleaned from previous animal studies on mRNA vaccines. PEGs were found to be distributed across a spectrum of tissues including the brain. [52] Additionally, nanoparticles (such as PEGylated hydrogel) are known components for state of the art medical interventions, including biosurveillance technology currently being developed by DARPA and companies like Profusa Inc. [17][18][19][20][21] The secretive nature of this technology necessitates a knowledge gap between developers and the general public, so although my research efforts have yet to verify a direct functional relationship between PEGylated nanoparticles used in covid vaccines and biosurveillance, I personally do not relish the prospect of being injected with such given their association with biosurveillance technology of the military industrial complex. Third, it is impossible to ascertain long term safety because of the foreshortened timeframe of Operation Warp Speed. [22] Vaccines should be tested for multiple years to adequately assess their longterm effects. [23] Short term safety is questionable too, as much of the data is still unavailable, and the current reports on safety and efficacy essentially amount to self-reported press releases from these companies themselves. [24] Fourth, the efficacy number of 90% for Pfizer and 94% for Moderna is statistically misleading, reporting a relative reduction instead of absolute reduction of risk*. Also, the trials only assessed these vaccines‚Äô ability to prevent mild symptoms and NOT their ability to prevent transmission. [25] If they don‚Äôt prevent people from transmitting the virus (especially when safer, cheaper drugs like Ivermectin do) [26] [27] what‚Äôs the point? Fifth, these are NOT vaccines in the normal sense. They are mRNA vaccines, which utilize a completely different process for achieving disease protection**; mRNA vaccines seek to introduce messenger RNA into the body in order to ‚Äútrick‚Äù cells into producing immunogens, which then stimulate an immune response. [28] These vaccines are the first of their kind ever to gain authorization. [29] Current vaccinations are essentially an extension of phase 3 of the trials. [30] Because of the lack of long term safety assessment and the new nature of this technology, people are participating in a mass human experiment with no way of knowing the long term health effects these could cause. Many problems from vaccines are known to have an incubatory period and do not manifest until much later, which is why testing needs to occur for multiple years in order to adequately assess risk. [31] One such problem currently being discussed is the mRNA technology‚Äôs possible impact on female fertility, as it encourages the production of antibodies against a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that contains a very similar protein crucial for the development of placenta called syncytin-1. This could interfere with the reproductive process by encouraging the immune system to react against syncytin-1, thereby disrupting placental development. [32] The vaccines‚Äô impact on fertility is currently unknown as animal reproductive toxicity studies have not been completed. [33] Sixth, there was a signature for many different problems seen in the various trials and initial rollout for these vaccines, problems that are concurrent with commonly documented vaccine injuries. Injuries that did occur in the various trials/rollout have included, but are not limited to, anaphylaxis, Bell‚Äôs palsy, transverse myelitis, multi-system inflammatory syndrome, encephalomyelitis, idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, and death. [34] [35] [36] [37] [50] [51] Seventh, and perhaps most importantly, the movement toward potential vaccine mandates or other coercive policies violates humanity‚Äôs most universally accepted principles of human rights and medical ethics, especially for a medical intervention with so many known and unknown safety/efficacy concerns. The absolute bedrock of medical ethics is the right to informed consent, as individuals must be made fully aware of all the potential benefits and risks associated with a medical intervention, while still maintaining the right to decline that intervention should they so choose. [41] Mandates or coercive measures fundamentally violate historical safeguards humanity has put in place to protect us from the ever present threat of medical tyranny, including the Nuremberg Code, the United Nations‚Äô International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and UNESCO‚Äôs Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights. [42] [43] [49] Such would also be in violation of the Hippocratic Oath, for not only do oath keepers pledge first to do no harm, but also to treat the needs of the patient. [44] This implies that a doctor‚Äôs duty primarily pertains to the needs of the individual before the needs of the collective, a vital distinction made by Hippocrates and understood for nearly 2 millennia. [45] [46] Privileging the needs of the collective is a ‚Äúfallacy of misplaced concreteness‚Äù. [47] While individual need is directly apprehensible and consensual, collective need is an abstract, subjective concept not easily defined. And yet who usually gets to define this concept? Such is most often defined by those in power with the most means to influence institutional narratives, turning medical professionals who treat the needs of the collective according to this definition into mere extensions of that power at the expense of individual informed consent.
0/0	Just proves that the vaccinations...are pointless.
0/0	Just pushing vaccines with more BS. Do you think the lock down of our ability to live life has anything to do with the traumas?
1/1	Just read on Wikipedia, vaccines have saved millions of lives and untold suffering. Read about polio.
1/1	Just received mine today, I feel totally fine so far. Administration was uneventful! We have to report how we are feeling every day for three weeks and then keep reporting monthly up to a year.

1/1	Just scheduled my 17 year old daughter's vaccine appt. Just need Pfizer to be approved for 12 to 15 year olds. Then I will be able to breath.
0/0	Just so everyone knows. All drugs and vaccines undergo large trials (tens of thousands of people) to make sure they are safe and effective - Phase 3 trials. That said. We never know EVERYTHING that could happen because it‚Äôs only a few months of safety data - in this case about 2 months of data. Most side effects you will see occur in that time. NOT ALL. So yes there is some uncertainty. Of course there is. You‚Äôll probably feel like shit for a few days, headache and muscle ache. But that means that mRNA got into your system good and you‚Äôre making antibodies to the spike protein like this video talks about. You eliminate the protein and the mRNA but your antibodies should remain. I won‚Äôt be the very first to get it but I won‚Äôt wait too long. The longer we wait the worse this gets. COVID won‚Äôt just blow over at the rate things are going. No way. And I don‚Äôt admit that this vaccine is the end all be all either. But it‚Äôs something.

I am kind of curious about this omacron thing and want to understand it better. Isn't the media saying that it's not that bad and on par with a common cold. If that's the case why would we do anything to prevent it? Why would we need immune protection to it? Doesn't getting the actual sickened give you a more robust immune response to subsequent covid infections?

1/1	Lemme get that
1/1	Less death and risk of long covid dramatically reduced with vaccine.
1/1	Less than 1 in 1 million. The stupidity of this can not be overstated. More people die from covid in a single day than the total number of those who would get the blood clots. And I say this as someone who is at a higher risk, we need to keep these vaccines rolling out.
1/1	Less than 1 in a MILLION side effects which is less than aspririne, less than having a plane fall on your head and even less than eating common food,
1/1	Less than 1 in a million- I‚Äôd take the vaccine rather than face covid unprotected
1/1/1	Less than 1 year, 95% of efficiency, no contraindications: mRNA vaccines may be one of the greatest science's enterprises of history Interesting to discover the making of Thanks for this video Thomas from üáÆüáπ
1/1	Less than 1% of the people who have gotten the vaccine had bad side effects.
1/1	Less than an hour since I received my first Pfizer jab! üòª no reactions as of yet! (nurse cleared air from needle but told me they normally don‚Äôt draw back into syringe)
1/1	Less than one person per million and they pause distribution, that is how good our system is and yet plenty of comments from ant-science ass wipes.

0/0	Less then a year to make a whole new vaccine??? Ummmm I'm not taking it with so many unknowns about a totally new vaccine that's, like I mentioned totally different.
0/0	Less vaccination, go for healthy life style, clean environment and good nutrition. More sustainable. The virus will subside. Get the right medicine to cure the disease.
0/0	Lesson: NEVER GET A LIFE OR DEATH VACCINE FROM THE SAME PEOPLE WHO MAKE YOUR HAIR SHAMPOO!!!
1/1	Let me ask a question. If you were bitten by a stray dog or any animal such as a bat that could that could not be caught and observed or physically examined, would you decline the rabies vaccine? Only if you are very stupid or have some sort of death wish. The point is - vaccines work
1/1	Let me just get this clear, Ron DeSantis won't promote a proven vaccine, yet will promote a COVID-19 treatment that does not work?
0/0	Let me just recap this more simply - mRNA will transcribe onto your cells part of the genoma related to a protein unique to Covid-19. It will "instruct" your cells into producing it and that - in theory, but sadly there's not data on long term effects of this doing - should trigger the production of antibodies to fight it. Pity that because your own immune system will be creating that protein which your antibodies will then have to fight, it will be as if you had acquired an auto-immune disease. Your cells are not designed to produce any "foreign" protein, especially that of viruses. You can have it, and good luck with it!

1/-1	Let there be Covid Crisis committee formed at all district/state/center level for close monitoring & cohesive coordination for making available the essentials to combat covid-19. Vaccination can take a back seat or go on but patients need urgent medical treatment or will die.
1/1	Let these idiots that don't want the vaccine just not get any help when they are sick.
1/1	Let those that wish to be vaccinated be protected, & let the dimwits‚Äô bank on herd immunity, until the virus diminishes. I don‚Äôt mind if the lesser of intelligence, are reduced in numbers.
1/1	Let those who don't want the vaccine or don't think it's necessary suffer. It's called natural selection.

0/0	Let us all take solace in knowing most of those who have taken the vaccine are leftist libt@rds. Soon the crime rates will drop significantly, there will be far less traffic, the stores less crowded, there will be less hate, and this site will be nearly void of all of their painful ignorance.

0/0	Let's all have no present illness, then get a vaccine that makes us sick. Such intelligent mindset. So Brave! So Stunning!
1/1	Let's all start treating anti vaxxers like what they are. They are the modern day lepers. They need to be shunned, chased away, silenced. If you know anyone who is anti Vax, please just delete them from your life. In this day and age how anyone can be so dumb is beyond me.
0/1	Let's ask Bill Gates if it's safe? Then let him have all of them all at once!
1/1	Let's be honest: It is a good thing that the EU manages and buys the vaccines. If it doesnt richer/bigger countries would have outbid the smaller ones leaving them behind without any vaccines.
1/1	Let's be positive! The late spring and summer will see the amount of virus reduce significantly. If by then we can also make sure that the vulnerable have received their jabs, we will all be in a much stronger situation! In the meantime we have to hope and pray that we keep as many people safe as possible.

0/0	Let's have everyone in the Media gets these shots first.
0/0	Let's hear him talk about that 3000 reported deaths have already happened from the vaccine (which is probably more because there's a lot of unreported events). It took corona to kill 3000 people in Ontario Canada in 7 months. It took this vaccine 3. AstraZeneca got banned in like 20+ countries, but Canada still think it's safe. If people don't get it now, they never will.

1/-1	Let's keep listening to the experts, they have got so much right through all this.
1/1	Let's lockdown all the unvaccinated.
0/-1	Let's look at things logically here for a moment. Vaccines have always relied on a person's immune response to create protection if the person is exposed to what they are being vaccinated against. The vaccine doesn't provide the protection. The body's response to the vaccine provides the protection. If you don't agree with that we have much bigger problems.
0/0	Let's make sure as many of these covid "vaccines" (DNA-altering delivery systems) are unused as possible. We don't want them!
0/0	Let's make this clear in case you're in dumbass crows‚Ä¶. Fuck you and your vaccine any questions????????

0/0	Let's say it like it is, forced vaccines = rape.
1/0	Let's see just how much we can get away with"
1/0	Let's see the long term data on these vaccines. Oh, that's right, there is no long term data.
1/-1	Let's see, incubation time for Omicron is about 3 days so wait for it, people. You should start feeling crappy about Wednesday. Hope you enjoy your long COVID as well.
1/0	Let's see... we were told it is 99% effective, HOWEVER, once vaccinated, you still need to wear masks because you can still get the virus. How does "99% effective" and "...you can STILL get the virus even if vaccinated..." square up? Which is it? Then, there's the question concerning those who have had the virus and survived, like 99.8% of those that get the virus. What is the benefit of getting a vaccination to protect you from a virus you've already recovered from? Would you get a flu vaccination AFTER recovering from the flu? Considering that Covid is a Coronavirus, like the Common Cold, Influenza, SARS, and MERS, that constantly mutates and that no vaccine has ever been successfully created to combat, is it possible that therapeutics like Ivermectin and others are a more viable method of combatting Covid? There's recently been a report of a Covid treatment that works like TamiFlu and is available by prescription. Why be part of an experiment when treatments exist that don't require one to be experimented on? Maybe people's resistance to the Covid vaccine stems from Common Sense and the underlying feeling that something's not quite right about all of this.
0/0	Let's talk about all the people that died or got severe adverse reactions from this experimental vaccine.
0/0	Let's talk about the deaths from this vax and the long term effects.
1/1	Let's talk about your percentages. Do the math: If everyone in the US for Covid and your math holds true then 3.3 MILLION people would die. Are you OK with that? Exactly how many people have to die before you people take this seriously? Those of you refusing to get the vaccine are messing it up for everyone else. Look at the UK: over 80% vaccinated, their cases have plummeted and hardly anyone is dying either,

0/0	Letting leaders use and abuse your health(barely any rest) isn't worth it, unless you're desparate for approval.

1/1	Let‚Äôs be honest, people with the IQ to evaluate this information are almost certainly already convinced that the vaccine is safe within defined parameters.

1/1	Let‚Äôs just face it. The anti-vaxxers don‚Äôt understand that their actions have consequences.
0/0	Let‚Äôs make sure we are clear‚Ä¶ This is not a vaccine. They are using the term ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù to sneak this thing under public health exemptions. This is not a vaccine. This is mRNA packaged in a fat envelope that is delivered to a cell. It is a medical device designed to stimulate the human cell into becoming a pathogen creator. It is not a vaccine. Vaccines actually are a legally defined term under public health law; they are a legally defined term under CDC and FDA standards.[1] And the vaccine specifically has to stimulate both the immunity within the person receiving it and it also has to disrupt transmission. And that is not what this is. They (Moderna and Pfizer) have been abundantly clear in saying that the mRNA strand that is going into the cell is not to stop the transmission, it is a treatment. But if it was discussed as a treatment, it would not get the sympathetic ear of public health authorities because then people would say, ‚ÄúWhat other treatments are there? The use of the term vaccine is unconscionable for both the legal definition and also it is actually the sucker punch to open and free discourse‚Ä¶ Moderna was started as a chemotherapy company for cancer, not a vaccine manufacturer for SARSCOV2. If we said we are going to give people prophylactic chemotherapy for the cancer they don‚Äôt yet have, we‚Äôd be laughed out of the room because it‚Äôs a stupid idea. That‚Äôs exactly what this is. This is a mechanical device in the form of a very small package of technology that is being inserted into the human system to activate the cell to become a pathogen manufacturing site. And I refuse to stipulate in any conversations that this is in fact a vaccine issue. The only reason why the term is being used is to abuse the 1905 Jacobson case that has been misrepresented since it was written. And if we were honest with this, we would actually call it what it is: it is a chemical pathogen device that is actually meant to unleash a chemical pathogen production action within a cell. It is a medical device, not a drug because it meets the CDRH definition of a device. It is not a living system, it is not a biologic system, it is a physical technology - it happens to just come in the size of a molecular package. So, we need to be really clear on making sure we don‚Äôt fall for their game. Because their game is if we talk about it as a vaccine then we are going to get into a vaccine conversation but this is not, by their own admission, a vaccine. As a result it must be clear to everyone listening that we will not fall for this failed definition just like we will not fall for their industrial chemical definition of health. Both of them are functionally flawed and are an implicit violation of the legal construct that is being exploited. I get frustrated when I hear activists and lawyers say, ‚Äúwe are going to fight the vaccine‚Äù. If you stipulate it‚Äôs a vaccine you‚Äôve already lost the battle. It‚Äôs not a vaccine. It is made to make you sick. 80% of the people exposed to SARSCOV2 are asymptomatic carriers. 80% of people who get this injected into them experience a clinical adverse event. You are getting injected with a chemical substance to induce illness, not to induce an immuno-transmissive response. In other words, nothing about this is going to stop you from transmitting anything. This is about getting you sick and having your own cells be the thing that get you sick. When the paymaster for the distribution of information happens to be the industry that‚Äôs doing the distributing, we lose. Because the only narrative is the one that will be compensated by the people writing the check. That goes for our politicians‚Ä¶ and our media - it has been paid for - if you follow the money you realize there is no non-conflicted voice on any network." - Dr. David Martin, Jan 5th 2021.
1/0	Let‚Äôs me guess‚Ä¶.FDA approves vaccine faster than any other before.
1/1/1	Let‚Äôs not blow this out of proportion, the vaccine was administered to about 7 million people and only 6 people had blood clots and only 1 died so if all of Norway got the J&J vaccine only one would die if any based on those numbers

1/1	Lockdown is & will continue to be hard - can empathise with those comments. Conspiracy theorists - there will always be a few! Very happy with progress made so far, sticking to the correct JCVI priorities & our increasing numbers this week. Hope to get my vaccine letter soon!
0/1	Lockdowns are the last option - they have a devastating impact on the economy and millions of lives.
0/0	Lol Love reading the excuses why you should still take this vaccine... strike 3!
0/0	Lol im never gettin the vaccine
0/0	Lol it‚Äôs really looking like a Zombie movie
1/1	Lol of course, the risk of side effects from the vaccine are insanely small compared to the risk of getting long lasting covid symptoms. Two ppl I know still can‚Äôt taste or smell after a year and another friend had to x-ray her lungs because she still, after almost a year, basically can‚Äôt do anything without getting winded. Lots more that I know complain about days of fatigue many months after they‚Äôve been declared healthy. Anyone taking risks with this fucking virus needs to get their head checked.
1/1	Lol people are scared of a vaccine but put tons of chemicals in crap in their bodies everyday through processed foods, drugs, alcohol and all types of products. There's microplastics in tap water. But muh vaccine
1/1	Lol people will buy blue ketchup and feed it to their kid without knowing the science because they trust the government on that one, but a vaccine is a no-go God Bless America
0/0	Lol vaccine for a virus with a 99.99997% survival rate
0/0	Lol who would have thought the vaxes were all poison worse than the disease.
0/0	Lol, I would certainly not get vaccinated to see France! Ugh!
0/-1	Lol, there are now 3 name brand Covid-19 vaccines on the market... anyone feel dumb yet?

0/0	London doctor describes ‚Äòunprecedented‚Äô level of sickness after COVID injection...
0/0	Long covid is the after effects of catching covid when you've had the "vaccine", it affects the body more than a normal infection.
0/1	Long covid sounds horrendous, I'm glad I'm fully vaccinated but hope i never experience it. Stay safe and stay alert all
0/0	Long covid, code for lets keep the vaccine gravy train rolling.
0/0	Long term data is missing from newly developed vaccines. There is also an issue of transparency.
0/0	Long term effects aren't even discovered yet. Way to risky with such a vaccine with ''emergency use only'' status. Besides everyone under 65 rather get covid than a vaccine. Unless ofcourse if they have health issues that would make covid dangerous.
1/1	Long term side effects (i.e. those that first become apparent develop >~ 8 weeks post vaccination) are so rare with vaccines in general that some people don‚Äôt think they happen at all. While the mRNA vaccines are a new type of vaccine, there is no reason to suspect they have a greater risk of long term toxicity than established vaccine technologies.
0/0	Long term side effects COMPLETELY unknown. Period. No thanks.
0/0	Long term...sterilization
1/1	Long-term effect of covid is worse! I will take the vaccine for sure.
0/1	Look I‚Äôm pro vax my kids get em but I won‚Äôt be getting a covid vaccine. They need to work out the kinks first. But you go head and test it. I was reading an article that a few people got Bell‚Äôs palsy. It‚Äôs just unknown and scary.
1/1	Look all i know is every vaccine in existence is okay but corona vaccine. Just believe in this one aswell!
0/0	Look at all those stupid sheep going for a vaccine that no one knows the side effects of. Enjoy your early cancers and possible sudden death.
1/1	Look at it this way, 99.992% of vaccinated people haven‚Äôt gotten COVID. Those vaccines are pretty darn good!
0/0/0	Look at the contents and components of the vaccine. Ask yourself this questions: ‚Äúwhat are the active ingredients?‚Äù Why use mRNA, aborted fetal tissues and heavy metals? Why use genetical modern vaccines instead of traditional vaccines. Doctors lie because they downplay the side effects or quote bogus statistics.
1/-1	Look at the current 5G roll out map, And then compare it to the corona virus map. Voila!
0/0	Look at these puppets getting injected to stay 'safe' from the flu, this is so comical, I can not bare anymore.
0/0/0/0/0	Look at third world countries that are doing much better with omicron despite their very low vaccination rate; natural immunity is more effective than vaccination.
1/1	Look guys, if German engineering can‚Äôt convince you of the safety of the vaccine, I don‚Äôt know what will.
0/0	Look into their eyes‚Ä¶they have no soul. These are truly evil people. I hope you guys don‚Äôt give this stuff to your kids. May god show his wrath on these evil elites.
1/1	Look people if you don‚Äôt wanna get the vaccine that‚Äôs ok. But don‚Äôt you dare get in the way of those of us who do. That‚Äôs just wrong in all kinds of ways. It‚Äôs not your right to make that choice for me or anyone else. I you wanna start being that way then let some of us make decisions for you. Don‚Äôt do to others what you don‚Äôt want done to you!
0/0	Look up all the lawsuits against the big pharma companies, that is all you need to know
0/0	Look up gene drive RNA shot not just cellular also RNA it's the tape they stick into you and your the tape player (alpha beta waves) these according to description affects your genes? I have to ask lot of questions before taking this thing IF I ever do take it
0/0	Look up the impact of Carbon nano-onions on Hydra vulgaris . They are both in the jab .
1/1	Look! How to stop covid =19 ? Ans = Only way to stop covid is to take Vaccine, One of the most inportant ingreadingents in a Vaccine is thr antigen. So. Give vaccine save yourself & family.
1/0	Look! We are all going to die one day. I would rather die on my feet then on my back so take the vaccine.
0/1	Look, don't take the vaccine, no skin of anyone's nose if you take your chances and then contract the virus. If you were unfortunate enough to react badly to the virus I'm sure you'd want to refuse oxygen or medical help too, which would be only fair.
0/0	Look, if you want to take a vaccine, take it! That's your right and choice. Just as its my right to believe this vaccine is not necessary.
1/1	Looking at how vaccines worked in the past I‚Äòm up for it.

1	Looking forward to getting vaccinated and getting back to normal.
1/-1	Looking forward to the supply catching up with the demand.
1/1	Looking up how vaccines work would definitely help... you're essentially injected with an artificial or dead virus. Which simulates the virus actually being in your body so your body can learn to fight it off. Hence getting ill. This is very normal and actually shows it's working as it should
1/1	Looks in antivaxxers head:nope no sign of a brain

1/0	Lots of RED FLAGS. Why are they pushing this so much. They have evil intentions is why. Think about it. Wake up people.
1/1	Lots of anti vax coworkers at my company are gonna lose their minds and I am SO FUCKING HAPPY
0/0	Lots of drugs approved by the FDA and tested for far longer periods of time end up developing serious and lethal side effects, if not immediately then years down the road.
0/1	Lots of fascinating stuff in this, as I think it's the first attempt to analyse how long protection might last from these vaccines. 91.3% at six months is stupendous, obviously, with the number looking incredibly robust thanks to the sheer number of cases recorded in the trial now.
1/1	Lots of love and respect to the science community. The media focuses a lot on crappy influencers, royals, actors and actresses , sports people but they forget about the people working anonymously to save and protect lives.
1/-1	Lots of people: I really want a Covid vaccine, but I‚Äôm a little uneasy about how fast the process has gone & I want to know it‚Äôs a safe vaccine that‚Äôs been properly vetted. Also lots of people: THREE WHOLE WEEKS TO READ 100s OF PAGES OF TRIAL DATA? WHY IS THE FDA LAZING AROUND?
0/0	Lots of unvaxxed people also have very mild cases of the virus too. No way to prove that the jabbed have less serious cases.
0/0	Love how he just describes an invisible ink injection like it's an everyday thing...think I'll risk the supposed deadly virus instead.
0/0/0	Love how media always try to label those who are against their agenda.
1/1	Love how nearly all anti-vaxxers are vaccinated.
1/1	Love how people that said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be scared of covid, it‚Äôs 99% survival rate!‚Äù Are now scared of side effects that affect one in a million
0	Love how they say ‚Äòit‚Äôs rare‚Äô when so many are showing up with side effects and even death prove it‚Äôs not so rare.
1/0	Love how they're experimenting on everyone and calling it new technology
1/1	Love science

0/1	Love the PSA from Wikipedia defining the dangers of NOT vaccinating. Wow!

1/1	Love this. Let's keep it up!
0/0	Lovely 30 second video from our beloved government. Hopefully you trust them enough to ensure your kids don't end up with birth defects
0/1/0	Lovely, the more side effects I get the better it is working. Great encouragement for the Sheeple to have the V-cine.
1	Luckily I had my Second shot
1/1	Luckily the Covid vaccine is not like others because the researchers did not have to struggle for years trying to get funded. Also, unlike most trials there was no shortage of volunteers to test it on. Also, researchers had started working a similar vaccine years before so much of the preliminary work was already done. Also, because of ridiculously lavish funding, they did not have to write up proposals and get approval every few months to keep research running. They were able to work fast not because of cutting corners of lack of testing but because they actually had the money they needed and prior work had already been done.
1/-1	Luckily the people you know survived. I work in healthcare. Sixteen patients I care for contracted COVID last December. Twelve of them died within a three week period. They were all under the age of 65. If you get sick with COVID, do us all a favor; stay at home and treat yourself. Let medical services go to those who at least tried to prevent becoming hospitalized.
1/1	Lucky to be vaccinated tomorrow..
1/1	Lucky to get my vaccine in Arizona because they are allowing teachers early access.
1	Lucky to have it done on Tuesday. Looking forward to it.

So anyone getting shots is a test bunny.... normally pharma companies would take responsibility for their products but nowadays they don't care about their products so they don't show human moral behavious as being responsible.....on contrary governments pay them huge sums of taxpayers money to do tests...and evaluation is politically dependent, e.g. the German health minister calls EMA and all the sudden experimental drugs in EU are safe...strange how science works in these days....

0/0	Man-made Vaccine to "cure" a man-made Disease. I know Genocide when I smell it, and this smells like Genocide . DISLIKE
0/1	Managing a vaccine at -70¬∞C is too massive a challenge not just for India, but, for any country with a tropical climate. Europe & North America can have the Pfizer vaccine, the rest of the world needs the likes of Oxford, COVAXIN, SPUTNIK-V..etc.(cost effective and easy to store)
1/1	Mandate the COVID vaccine now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0/0	Mandates and forced inoculations are not socially acceptable. May the word spread far and wide!
1/1	Mandating COVID-19 vaccines for children to attend school in person is a "good idea" due to a strong benefit-risk ratio
0/0	Mandating something absent of long term data is one hell of a risk to take. The odds of some unforeseen side effect years from now is miniscule. But if you've got it wrong, you're going to be wrong several billion times.

1/1	Many dying now are un vaccinated, why are people against the vaccine, we all get vaccinated when we was young, we get vaccinated when we go to certain countries, you have to have your vaccination when you joined the armed forces
1/1	Many experts in pediatric infectious disease, pediatric cardiology, epidemiology have looked very carefully at this data both within the FDA and the CDC, and are overwhelmingly confident that the vaccine is safe and effective for all the age groups for which it's authorized.
1/1	Many health agencies across the globe have found the vaccine to be safe. The benefits of the vaccine are not only preventing infection for yourself (thus preventing your own death and long term health effects from covid), but also should include slowing the spread of covid and preventing you from transmitting it others.
0/0	Many hospital trusts reported excess staff illness from catching covid... most in the vaccinated portion
1/1	Many of My family members in the UK have had the Astra Zeneca and they are all fine.
0/0	Many of the covid-19 vaccines actually have been vaccines developed over the last decade and could not pass safety procedures, but are now being forced on citizens under EUA, Emergency Use Authorization, meaning you will be used as the experimental guinea pig. Not mentioned by mainstream media is that coronavirus covid-19 can be cured overnight by any or a combination of the following: Supersalts 1 drop in 1 glass water Aphrodisia 1 tsp in 1 glass water Virgin coconut oil 1 tbsp 3x daily 2,000 mg fish oil 3-5x daily Vitamin C 2,000 mg 5-10x daily Zinc supplement Vitamin D or 15 minutes of sunshine Melatonin Papaya, pineapple Ampalaya or bitter gourd and even by dissolving 2 tablespoons of sea salt in 1 glass of water, boiling it and breathing the steam. And to those who have none of the above, prayer to Yashua Mashiyach (Jesus Christ to many).
1/1	Many of the same people who are yelling that the vaccine is unsafe due to rare side effects are the same ones who downplay the risk of severe outcomes for catching COVID.
1/1	Many of those later deaths won‚Äôt be dead had they been vaccinated.
1/1	Many of those who dismissed Covid as a threat because it had a ‚Äú1% fatality rate‚Äù are now freaking out about the vaccine because it has a 1 in a million fatality rate. Seems people overestimate the risks of doing something and underestimate the risks of doing nothing.

0/0	Many people are unaware that the COVID-19 vaccine has significantly more side effects than the flu vaccine.
0/0	Many people get hurt by medications. I was hurt very badly by a Pfizer medication. The one thing I have learned in this is that you have absolutely no voice. Nobody wants to hear about it. No doctors no media, nobody.
1/1	Many people get this question wrong. Whether the vaccine is safe isn‚Äôt the point. The delta variant of covid is highly contagious. You either get the vaccine or you risk getting covid. Having covid is much more dangerous than the low chance of an issue with a vaccine. I just had my first covid jab yesterday. Sure it sucked. I hate needles which makes it worse. And right after, I didn‚Äôt feel that great. But my friend who got covid nearly died. He was one step from being on a ventilator. Still to this day he has breathing issues. It‚Äôs simply not worth it.
0/0	Many people had bad side effects ü§îmaybe he got the non killer one

1/0	Many people i talk with at work have said they won't get the vaccine and it pisses me off because they in my opinion are no better than the people who don't wear masks and don't wash hands and are one of the major reasons the virus has spread‚Ä¶
0/-1	Many people seem to know now that vaccine is making more bad than help.
0/0	Many people suffering from multiple discomfort after taking the vaccine. My friend been complaining of headache, others have face weird discomfort like getting paralysed, some died after taking it, but not being reported and still pushing it. Protect the children from dehumanizing them.
0/0	Many people who got 2nd dose vaccine died within the next few days
0/0	Many provaxxers will never admit they were tricked in to poisoning their children because that kind of psychological toll is too much to handle & it‚Äôs easier for them to continue with the lie. The ego‚Äôs initial response is to protect itself first and foremost.

1/0	Marissa decided that her arthritis came from vaccines through google
0/0	Mark my words. Millions will take vaccine soon, hospitals will be massively overwhelmed with "adverse effects", they'll say they all have Covid (they do, they just injected it in them) and they'll fear porn and bring out military to inject everyone, resulting in millions dead.

0/0	Mask don't work nor vaccine, we need to build a tolerance up .
0/0	Mask, Hygiene and having a strong healthy immune system is the answer! ü•Ç
0/0	Mask, and everything should be a choice......not mandated
0/0	Mask,vaccine cannot save you only Jesus can save you and your family.call on his Name
0/0	Masks don't work. This vaccine doesn't work.
1/1	Masks work because they prevent you from potentially spreading the virus by a lot, vaccines work because they prevent you from becoming severely ill. Ned changes the rules based on CDC guidelines. And vaccination efforts certainly help kill the spread. We're in a good place.
0/-1	Masks,vaccine and testing are a danger to your health. Covid is the least of our worries
0/0	Masks=Vaccines=Control
0/0	Mass Sterilization
0/0	Mass deception. Covid isn't real. The rigged testing system is real. Vaccine damage is very real. And those damaged are testing positive on the rigged testing system. A giant scam to get you into a biosecurity totalitarian system. RT
0	Mass sterilisation program for the next few generations
1/1	Mass vaccination will let us gradually get back to normal.
0/0	Mate covid vaccine ant in my evolution thanks!! il be fine like i have been, my family have been.friends since this all kicked off
1/1	May God pull a survival of the fittest on antivaxxers and then we'll see...

1/1	May I have one of their vaccines please?
1/1	May everyone in entire world will get vaccines before more lost of lives.
1/1	May the Lord God, who gives wisdom, have mercy on this vaccine and heal us
1/1	May the symptoms be weak, and your recovery strong. I agree with getting boosted, brother.
0/1	Maybe I should do a survey in my town on who was asked to do this so called survey probably zero.
0/0/0/0/0	Maybe because it is not a vaccine, we do not know the long term effects. A true vaccine is never rushed and since when has anybody cured a virus
0/0	Maybe because they created the virus in haste. And that made me doubt more the effectivity and the possible side effects of all these covid vaccine.
0/0	Maybe if the people that were supposedly protecting us wasn‚Äôt lying so much from the beginning , oh yeah and the the Big Confidence of no long term issues, gtfoh. . One minute it‚Äôs‚Äù there are no long term effects‚Äù next ‚Äú we can really say or agree to that due to the fact it‚Äôs So New‚Äù LOL
1/1	Maybe it's time those who lie about being vaccinated and endanger others are prosecuted then sued.
0/1	Maybe more than 50% don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want some rushed medicine injected into them without testing first ,and that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a good thing
0/0	Maybe people started to realize that vaccines aren‚Äôt near as necessary as big pharma makes them seam?

0/0	Maybe the Vaccine is giving them Covid ?
0/-1	Maybe the majority of Americans have been living with this virus and realize it‚Äôs not a big deal. Our household just got it and we took a hydroxychloriquine cocktail. Feeling great, nothing to see here.
0/-1	Maybe their idea of Phase 3 is releasing the vaccine & 'vaccinating' the civilian population ü§î
0/0	Maybe these other countries do NOT want to sell their country‚Äôs people, and soul, and SIGN AWAY THEIR NATIONAL ASSETS to the fecking devil that is Pharma.
1/0	Maybe this hoax is ending but I don't it. After Omicron will come AnotherCon.
0/0	Maybe this question should be asked: what is the global definition of a vaccine, since it only lasts a few months, then it is merely a medication, with a poor efficiency rate?
1/1	Maybe this will convince the science deniers to get vaccinated.
1/1	Maybe vaccines skeptics should just research it cuz the base of Pfizer is the same base in other common vaccines
0/0	Maybe you should interview every vaccinated person that has side effects instead of just one. That way, we all have a better understanding of the multiple side effects that can occur from all the vaccines. Then you will get peoples attention.
1/1	Mayors, governors, the President, etc. should be vaccinated immediately. Regardless of their political beliefs its critical that the people running our governments are healthy and on the job. Remember what happened when Trump got sick? The Government went into free fall and there was serious concerns about who was making critical decisions. You don't want that even on a state or local level.
0/0	Mc Donald‚Äôs is offering free burgers if you get vaccinated as if Mc Donald‚Äôs ever cared about anyone‚Äôs health. Laughable!!!
1/1	Me and 7 of my friends had the AstraZeneca vaccine yesterday and not even a sore arm in any of us. I‚Äôm so so happy to have had my first vaccine. #beyondblessed
1/1/1/1	Me and all my college educated friends have got it(and were fine), and all of my friends who are unhealthy, have less education, and are at higher risk for health problems are being ‚Äúfree thinkers‚Äù are not getting it. Survival of the fittest I suppose...
1/1	Me and my 14 year old Cousin got Sinovacs two doses and Moderna as Booster no side effect so far so fantastic.
1/1	Me and my 68 year old wife are both fully vaccinated. It feels so good! Thanks for your part in trying to bring science to the table. We still mask and other interventions. We will get to the other side!
1/1	Me and my Mom will get vaccinated next week, it will be our first shot.
1/1	Me and my children are going to get the vaccine.
1/1/1/1	Me and my coworkers in the hospital will be finally able to get vaccinated. Leaving your home everyday to go to work knowing that you can get infected anytime is very scary, since we are running low on PPE. I'm tired mentally and physically and last month we had a meeting that we had to prepare for a next wave! Oh God when is this going to end?!!!

1/1	Me and my family are all getting vaccinated and guess what? Millions of people have gotten vaccinated and 99.999 percent of those people are fine. Stop spreading fear with your lies.
1/1	Me and my family have received both doses of the vaccine and we‚Äôre grateful for it. I‚Äôve lost two friends to COVID-19 in 2020 and I don‚Äôt want to loose anymore. The vaccine is here to protect you and your loved ones. These conspiracy theories are ridiculous. Literally every vaccine ever has been created in a lab just like this one
0/0	Me and my family will remain unvaccinated :)
0/0	Me and my girlfriend are not taking it
0	Me and my girlfriend had covid 3 weeks ago. Happily unvaccinated.
1/1	Me and my parents were a little skeptical at first but all it took was some research to find out it was safe. As long as you get your info from actual sources and not facebook you should be fine! üëç
0/0	Me and my whole family won't take any of the vaccines, We only trust in God and no one else‚Ä¶
1/1	Me and my wife Covid last January 5. We had two weeks of quarantine and being isolated while you're sick sucks. Good thing my parents were there to send food and help us whenever we need assistance. After two weeks of being isolated, got out and went to our vaccination area to get our booster shot. Thankfully, nothing bad happened after that.

1/1	Me as Brazilian looking to get any vaccine
0/0	Me no have vacation God gives me power to fight covid 19
0/0	Me personally I will pass. I am not anti vax, but I am not going rush into it neither. I have had 10 people i know perosnally get it and recover from it. if i get it i ll take my chances that my body can fend it off. There are also so many medical studies using other approachs to fight it off besides the vaccine. I think we have to stop labeling people as anti vaxers if they want to wait to see how things play out.
0/-1	Me personally, I don't recommend this but if it gets too serious, I suggests that instead of getting vaccine, we put in something that worsens the virus or health condition of someone for awhile and activate the corona virus to kill the patient immediately. Instead of letting it spread. I'd make the first sacrifice if I am the patient itself and we are desperate to stop this spread... I know, ppl do say I am only saying this because I am not infected, which is true. But if gets near to the end of the world by then, who cares right... Everyone dies by then if we dont solve the problem immediately like that, who knows it may even evolve right... Hmmm
0/0	Me taking it won't protect someone else's life. I'm a young guy in his 20s so the vaccine most likely won't save my life either. It might make it a more pleasant experience, but its not worth the risk of the hangover side effects. Human trials need 2 years to properly research potential long term effects anyway
1/1	Me too can‚Äôt wait till the 25th for my second dose!
1/1	Me too, like my 82 year old grandma, she said for the longest time she wasn‚Äôt going to get her‚Äôs then out of nowhere yesterday she called and ask us to get her one, I have no idea what made her change her mind but it made my day, she got her first dose today. I'm so happy
1/1	Me too. The moment it becomes available I will get it. It wouldn‚Äôt be approved if it wasn‚Äôt safe!

1/-1	Me: i am first Ohhers: not so fast
1/-1	Meanwhile at home trump has screwed up distribution so much we should have herd immunity in 10 years... it will be good to finally get real leadership at the top in a few weeks. So sad so many needless deaths from trump incompetence.
1/1	Meanwhile in Germany: 3% fully vaccinated after 3 months. What a joke. We have to get more vaccines out to more people!
1/1	Meanwhile in other countries people can't wait to get vaccinated. Vaccines save lives.
1/1	Meanwhile, you have a 1 in 50 chance for an ischemic stroke(blood clot supplying the brain) with a covid infection. Of course, people(particularly anti-vaxxers) will somehow think that the risk of 1 in 1.1M somehow is comparable to 1 in 50 and would rather take their chances with a 1 in 50 risk than a 1 in 1.1M risk.
1/1	Measles and mumps are largely nonexistent because of vaccination.
1/1	Measles isn‚Äôt something to joke about. Please vaccinate.
1/1	Measles: I fear no man Measles: BUT THAT THING! a vaccine Measles: it scares me
1/1	Measuring vaccination rates by how many people have gotten their first dose is nonsensical. YOU NEED THE SECOND DOSE AND A FEW WEEKS AFTER YOU"LL BE IMMUNE!!!!!!!!!!!
0/0	Media led people to their deaths! They insisted you take those dangerous drugs
0/0	Medical "scientists" , don't know how most Rx drugs work - they have theories about pathways being blocked or opened but not MUCh more.....That's why once an RX drug is FDA approved and then the awful effects unwanted start maiming people THAT's when it gets taken OFF the experiment on people/market...
0/0	Medical Apartheid, alive and well in much of the world, 2022...
0/0/0/0/0	Medical companies want the money and more money. They hide, do not tell the truth. They want to sell that vaccine = more money. But the vaccine is not safe. I do not want to be the one who died from vaccine.
0/-1	Medical professionals are getting a different COVID vaccine. They‚Äôre not getting the same one as the general public. My husband was having a chat with a consultant at our local hospital.
0/0	Medical professionals should tell you that a vaccine has to be tested for a certain number of years before it is safe to take. All the doctors and medical professionals who now have flip flopped and are telling people to just take the covid vacvine over and over are not practicing what they learned in medical school. I will definitely not be taking it myself and I applaud these nurses for exercising their constitutional rights as American citizens!üëç

0/-1	Mix and match the risks? No thanks. I preferred pick n mix when it was available.

0/0/0/0	Moderna has no experience ever developing a vaccine.... covid 19 is the first and its all rushed.
0/0	Moderna have never produced vaccines, they are a Gene Therapy Company
1/1	Moderna is a smaller drug company so he needs to license his vaccine to the much larger drug companies like Merck et al! POTUS-46 should use the War Production Act to make more vaccine stocks. including starting today making the J & J single dose. which is more stable. That means it needs less temperature control. a great factor to more rural areas around the country!
1/-1	Moderna is good
0/0	Moderna vaccine = Gates vaccine. No way in hell take it. From the guy who says we need to depopulate and figure out a way to get people ready to not work anymore.

1/1	Most medical colleges and professionals agree that what experienced is completely normal. Since the vaccine is only effective after the second dose, I would strongly recommend taking it.

1	Most of the problems we are facing today depend on the fact that there are unvaccinated people
1/1	Most of the vaccines are targeting the spike protein, which is the protein the virus uses to enter cells. Although the virus doesn't appear to be mutating rapidly it's possible the spike could mutate. In fact the spike already mutated in mink in Denmark. One thing that's great about the Oxford vaccine and the mRNA vaccines is that they can quickly be edited to protect against a different form of the spike if necessary so a new form of the vaccine could be developed super fast rather than starting from scratch.
0/0	Most of these vaccines are faked...the plungers are in or empty and the needles are not going into the arm.
0/0	Most of those smeared as anti-vaxxers have no problem with a vaccine per se. What they do have is a problem with vaccination by coercion, and any future requirement to show evidence of vaccination to partake in normal life; via some app or e-certificate. Once this is normalised, it's a few short steps to a Chinese-style social control system. Even some distinguished politicians are worried.
0/1	Most of us are not anti vax. We are anti new and no long term side effects studies done. Big difference.
0/-1	Most of us aren't anti-vaccine, we're just anti-stupidity‚Ä¶
1/1	Most people are very very bad at estimating odds. That's why they have built casinos and lottery :) I think saying 1 in a million to most people is not very convincing even though the risk of dying in a car accident while driving to get the vaccine is much higher.
0	Most people believe the most washed body part of 2020 was the hands. In actual fact it was the brain.
1/1	Most people i know are conservative. Everyone I know has the vaccine.
0/0	Most people i know dont want(or need) a vaccine
0/0	Most people recover from covid. These are not FDA approved!!! Don‚Äôt buy pharmaceutical stocks. This is about money, politics and control!
1/1	Most people who are up to date on COVID-19 vaccination with no COVID-like symptoms do not need to quarantine or be restricted from work or school following an exposure to someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
0	Most people who take this vaccine will be dead within 5 years! 4.2 million doses have been administered in the US!.So by 2025 the population maybe half of what it is now!
0/0	Most people will NEVER put that poison in their bodies!!!! I wouldn‚Äôt put that crap in my body if you paid me a million dollars!!!
1/1/1/1	Most people, I have talked to about the coronavirus shot told me there arm was sore and they had a mild headack. When the flu shot very first came out, I can rember people saying there family members died from the flue shot. But I still got it anyways and I did fine.
0/0	Most ppl in my college town are excited about getting the jab. After all my research, I'd never take this poison
0/0	Most profitable business at the moment. Vaccines. Don't take them
1/1	Most strange how these vaccine doubters can worry about the long term effects of a vaccine and NOT worry about the long term effects of covid. If there is any risk of the former, I sure as HELL would choose it over the latter.
0/-1	Most supposed covid deaths were actually caused by something else. Even when people die of the vaccine they will try to blame it on covid instead. Set of total liars.
1/1	Most things we do have an element of risk of injury, for example driving a car, being a passenger in an aircraft, crossing the road, walking up steps, using pain medication, using antibiotics, using electricity or having a vaccination. The risk of blood clots appears to be about 1 in a million. No one can guarantee 100% safety but virtually all people understand the benefits far out weigh the risks.
1/1	Most vaccines are good, there are just some that are bad. I‚Äôve been vaccinated quite a few times, and I‚Äôm fine.
1/1	Most vaccines are safe . Myself and my children have just about every vaccine available
0/0/0/0/1/0	Most vaccines are safe . Myself and my children have just about every vaccine available . Covid vaccine is too new . Let the people who think it's safe get it . I'll wait and see what happens .
1/1	Most vaccines present some temporary minor side effect. It beats getting the actual disease by far.
1/1	Most virologists believe Covid will be with us for our lifetimes. It won't ever go away, but we can ensure herd immunity is reached and enforced.
1/1	Most will take it once testing has assuaged fears
1/1	Mother Nature bans unvaccinated children from life
0/0	Mother in law only had sciatica. She has had paramedics 3x since having the Astra Zeneca. Chest pains. Massive swollen knee. And then a swollen tongue, she couldn‚Äôt swallow. Nobody wants to say the vax is involved here...it‚Äôs disgusting
1/1	Mothers from poorer countries would go to ends of earth for vaccines for their children, especially when most vaccines are not available for them. It's tough to see anti vaxxers campaigning for no vaccines that's supposed to save their lives
1/1	Motorcycle helmet is individual, but the vaccine disinformations have killed about 100,000 uniforms who follow some politicians like her. I felt bad for her family lost but having one less person to spread wrong information is crucial.
0/0	Mouse to another Mouse " Are you going to take the Covid Vaccine?" Other Mouse, "Do you think I'm Stupid? They're still testing them out on Humans!"
1/1	Moving experience yesterday, needed to gain the trust of a young man with learning disabilities to safely give him the #vaccine, took some time but we got there. Mum was so grateful and he went home very happy (and so did I Grinning face with smiling eyes) #lovemyjob
1/1	Mr Modi should immediately 1. Cancel Central Vista 2. Sell his luxury planes 3. Deploy PM Cares Fund And use the funds to vaccinate every single Indian #Tika_Vaccination_Utsav
1/1	Mr. President, my mother and I just received the second Pfizer vaccine today‚Ä¶ I cannot thank you and your extraordinary staff enough for your diligent hard work in making sure Americans are receiving this vaccine as quickly as we now are. I‚Äôm so glad I voted for you!!!!!
1/1	Mrs. Karen Stupidson:But what if my son is one of the 100 people that will get the serious elergic reaction. Me:SHUT THE FLIP UP LADY. THE PROBABILITY IS SO LOW THAT IT WILL BE PRETTY MUCH IMPOSSIBLE
1/1	Much better than the side effects of not having the vaccine.
1/1	Much better to be vaxed than not.
0/-1	Much respect for these protesting folks! Stay safe
1/1	Mum got the AstraZeneca vaccine an hour ago, all good. Such great news for everyone.
1/1	Mumps, measles, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, small pox, pertussis, typhoid, polio...etc. Must be a reason these diseases are nearly eradicated. It's like there was some sort of shot or something.
0/0	Murdered Babies in vaccines. Mrc-5. Wi-38. Human diploid cells. If you are against abortion you are a no vaxxer. If you are not a cannibal you are a no vaxxer. If you believe children should not be murdered you are a no vaxxer. If you approve of murdering children and eating them then you are pro vaxxer. But wait there's more. Do you approve of injesting other pollutants such as polysorbate. Aluminum. Mercury. Formaldehyde. Cow puss. Monket cancer cells? Recombinant Human Albumin. Research the ingredients.
0/0	Murderers...it affects the enzyme P53 which is crucial to combat cancer. It also replaces the Natural immune system. It produces inflammation and increases infection. Cloughing problems show even in healthy people who have been vaccinated. And most of all it does not stop spreading infection. Vaccinated people still spread covid. Only relief the symptoms caused by covid. Is a mRNA Carrier to make you a genetically modified organism
0/0	Murky science from the Left with jabs every 2 mos. Vaccines are supposed to generate memory b cells that can produce antibodies when needed again. But now with boosters are are artificially keeping antibodies up and not allowing memory b cells to do their jobs.
0/-1	Must be great getting paid to get a vitamin shot live on TV!
1/1	My 11yr old nephew had COVID in November, now +ve again. My bro just reminded me he‚Äôs unvaccinated as not eligible. I do really worry about repeated exposure of our kids to a virus that causes multi-system disease. When oh when will JCVI make a decision about vaccinating <12s?
0/0	My 13 & 9 year old just had covid & ran around like nothing happened. My little cousin is 3 & had a fever for 4 hours & ran around like nothing happened. These babies dont need these shots & anybody looking forward to this should be ashamed of themselves
0/0	My 2 cents. Build your immune system naturally. 1 Zinc and Quercetin 2 Vitamin C and sunshine and Vitamin D daily. Just common sense.
0/0	My 21 year old son was in the hospital for three days after his second Phizer vaccination
0/0	My 27 year old sister took moderne vaccine. Days later she ended up in ICU for 8 days. She is better.. but she is seeing numerous neurologist to figure out why half her face and arm is still numb 2 months after taking the vaccine.
1/1	My 2nd and booster dose gave me a fever. Couldn't sleep and I was in pain for the night but that's just my bodies immune response. After that I felt fine the day after so I'd day it was worth it. Still Covid free for now at least.
1/1	My 2nd dose of Moderna hit me pretty well. Shivers, mild fever, muscle aches, and a headache. Recovered fully the next day like nothing ever happened. Was totally worth getting the vaccine, and would do it all again to prevent from actually getting Covid.
0/0	My 5 month old niece is in the hospital with covid 19 she got from her mother who took the vaccine 3 weeks ago. Mother test positive now with no symptoms. Great huh? I'll be thinking twice about this and you should as well. Oh, and her Daddy came down with it yesterday ! Wonder how he got it...
1/1	My 53-year-old brother(both doses), our 78-year-old mom(both doses)and my 48-year-old self(first dose)have gotten the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. With the exception of my brother having a sore arm for a couple of days, we're all doing well so far. We're in NE Tennessee.
1/1	My 67y old mom got the pfizer covid vaccine 2w ago, she has had 0 negative side-effects... Next week I will get it..
1/1	My 7 year old neice with cystic fibrosis and severe lung problems will be getting the vaccine this week. Such a relief for all the family. She will be able to play with friends again and see people. It has been a nightmare for vulnerable children.
1/1	My 70 year old brother-in-law died from Covid on Dec 31st. My sister and niece both got it but survived. Now, they're protected with the Moderna and I got the Pfizer in February.
1/1	My 70 year old mom was very excited to get her first shot
1/0	My 70 year old mom was very excited to get her first shot, and now has SIRVA because the nurse didn‚Äôt administer it properly smh (not at UCLA).
1/1	My 70 yo mom is receiving her 1st dose #vaccine today &amp; I am thrilled for her! #COVIDVaccine #COVID #Moderna #fridaymorning
1/1	My 73 year old husband had his on tuesday, not a single side effect not even a sore arm! Roll on mine!
1/1	My 77 year old mother had mild symptoms from the vaccine. She had a breakthrough case in August and didn't have to be hospitalized. She quarantined for two weeks and all good. I'm certain we would have lost her had she not been vaccinated.
1/1/1	My 83 u/o husband has had both shots and I have had the first. Neither one of us felt anything at all. Maybe we're just lucky. Don't let the worry about minor symptoms scare you off. A few days of feeling like you have a bad cold is a heck of a lot better than dying alone, (without your family or friends), in a hospital bed with no one but space-suited mystery people around you.
1/1	My 84 year old parents had the Oxford Astrazeneca vaccine earlier this week. No side effects at all.
1/1	My 86 year old Mother and I had our Vaccine March 19th. Absolutely no side effects. Thank you for Science

0/0	My Dad had a heart attack right after second vaccine.
1/1	My Dad had polio, as the vaccine was being created. Vaccinations saved SO MANY lives!!
1	My Doctors reply about my asking him about COVID vaccine. "I strongly recommend the vaccine. We have not had live through the small pox and polio thanks to vaccines. The Covid 19 vaccines are state of the art, safe vaccine. They were developed faster because of lack of red tape but not lack of safety data. Covid 19 Kills! Getting the vaccine will not only protect you but also your love ones( you will not be transmitting the virus to them)."
0/0	My Father met a doctor who cured his radiation on his neck in world war two! Hiroshima! He told my Dad back then if a vaccine comes out wait 24 months before you take it!
0/0	My Friends, Run Away from COVID-19 Vaccine. It's Deadly!
0/0	My GOD fearing brothers and sisters. There is a reason Jesus said"let the doctors heal themselves and follow me". Please look it up it's in scripture. Much Love!
0/0	My God ! How many people have to die from vaccine for others to wake up !!!
0/0	My God given immune system works better than anything you could possible offer. No thanks
0/0	My Grandmother, 95 years old, survived COVID but died two days after her second shot just a week ago. No one in my family is getting it after that happened.
1/1	My Grandparents both had their first COVID-19 vaccine a couple of weeks ago and they‚Äôve learnt lots of people are scared about having the vaccine. She says ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had ours and we‚Äôre fine‚Äù & encourages others to get theirs done too.
1/1	My Husband and I, Both 68, took both vaccines and had no problem at all... I even helped on Valentine's Day at my daughter's flower shop. I had to get the second vaccine then.... I went right back to work and I never was sore or tired....
0/0	My Immune system is better than this POISON
0/0	My Lord, who is writing your check? Every chance you get, you are defending every flavor of vax propaganda or trying dismiss information that 90% of us have never even seen.
1/1	My MD said it was up to me if I wanted to get vaccinated since I might not mount a sufficient immune response. Since the vaccine is made of mRNA instead of actual virus, my doctor wasn‚Äôt worried about it making me sick. So far I‚Äôve gotten my first dose last week and feel fine.
1/1	My Marine called - he got the first dose of the vaccine! YAY!!! He's been exposed twice, but did not catch it. But since he is in a hot spot area, it is better to be safe than sorry.
1/1	My Mom has got her first dose on Thursday- we are all so excited and relieved. And as a retired nurse she is well aware of what she is doing.
1/1	My Mom has had Cancer since 2008. WBC usually low. She took her vaccine and Survived Covid along a MAJOR neck surgery at the same time. All glory to God. Medical Science are here to help. Get your vaccine. Yes she got sick of Covid even when vaccinated but did not need hospitalization. She was in the hospital because of surgery.
1/1	My Mom is finally getting her first dose today
1/1	My Mom is getting her second dose of Moderna sometime this month and it will take so much stress off of me. This past year has been Hell for me, she‚Äôs high risk and so anytime I‚Äôve gone to pick up groceries or had to go anywhere I‚Äôve gotten so stressed because I don‚Äôt want to be responsible for her death.
1/1	My Mommy. We lost Dad less than 30 days before...my whole world changed Stay safe - mask up, get vaccinated, take care of one another
1/1	My Mother and I received our 2nd dose of Pfizer just yesterday.
0/0	My Mother's Myasthenia Gravis was in remission for 22 years until two weeks after taking the 2nd covid shot and BAM, back full force.
1/1	My Mum died from Covid today. It's a terrible way to die, I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. Please people get the vaccination.
1/1	My Mum found it no different to the flu jab, she felt a little achy for about 24-48 hour's but other than that she's absolutely fine. The alternative doesn't bare thinking about. I shall be rolling up my sleeve as soon as it's offered.
0/0	My Mum had the Covid vaccine in February, she's been ill ever since. 76 year's with no health issues all changed at a vaccine
1/1	My Mum, who is 74 had her vaccine last Thursday, she was so excited. She has felt a bit out of sorts but that hasn‚Äôt bothered her, she is looking forward to when she can give her Grand Daughters a big hug
0/0	My OBGYN is forever tryna encourage me to take the vax cuz ‚Äúbeing pregnant makes ur covid risk higher‚Äù bruh I haven‚Äôt been sick since 2019!! I refused !
0/0	My Protection is God not some vaccine
0/0	My Sister in law had 2 blood clots & a stroke 5 days after the Astra vaccine. She‚Äôs recovering now but couldn‚Äôt walk or talk for a month
1/1	My Sister lost her pregnancy exposed to a child with measles. I had my son vaccinated at every stage, including measles
1/1	My actual answer: Not immediately, because I'm young, healthy and I have a job that allowes me to work 100% from home. Therefore, I would like to make sure everyone who needs it more than I do has a chace to get a vaccine before me.
0/0	My advice is to use therapeutics that are available and 100% effective. DO NOT TAKE THIS VACCINE!
1/1	My advice... take the first vaccine you are eligible for... and at the first opportunity. Today I was vaccinated at my local pharmacy with the AstraZenica vaccine
1/1	My almost 7 year old is really excited. She has been asking about her shot for months. My 4 year old is also ready to be getting it when she turns 5. My kids, young kids, are eager or at least positive about getting their vaccines. Is it really that hard to get the adults on board too?
0/0	My answer: Never ;)
1/1	My anti vaxxer neighbor died yesterday‚Ä¶leaving behind a 13 year old son..she was one of those protesters here in my town asking for freedom..well now she has ‚Äú freedom‚Äù and her son lost her mother
1/1	My antivaxx aunt convinced my grandmother to not get the second jab and I managed to convince my grandma otherwise! I‚Äôm so happy she‚Äôs protected and safe!
1/1	My appt for my first shot is early next week and I feel like I may cry when I get it. Congrats.
1/1	My arm has been killing me for 24 hours since I got my first dose ibuprofen helped and yes lots of water helps!!!!

1/1	My aunt already had her second shot an no real side effects. And i have been watching her close incase anything did.
0/0	My aunt caught covid 19 after receiving the vaccine üò° She was in icu, she doing better in a regular room now thank god found out this morning she's not taking the second dose.
1/1	My aunt in Indonesia contracted covid after going to Bali for a short holiday. She slowly suffered and shared photo of herself looking scared and helpless, sent us voice texts sounding breathless and suffocating. All the while exchanging prayers or words of encourage in the family group chat. Please the virus is real, even if you are strong and healthy, others may not be and will suffer from this virus. Thank God she recovered but she still got herself vaccinated for added protection.
1/1	My aunt is one of the few to have a reaction to the Astra Zenaca vaccine and has been hospitalised here in Australia. It won‚Äôt put me off my jab but it is concerning #AstraZenaca
1/1	My aunt refused the vaccine and refused to wear a mask, she got Covid and was in ICU for three months and died. She leaves behind two young daughters and her husband. Her decision didn‚Äôt effect just her, it will effect her family for the rest of their lives. I still get angry at her at times because she could have still been here, I am sure she regrets her decision near the end of her life, her last words when they were trying to lighten her sedation was that she just wanted to go home. We truly miss her.
0/0	My aunt took 2 doses of the vaccine and now she's really really sick.

0/0/0/0/0	My aunt took 2 doses of the vaccine and now she's really really sick. And then you see persons also dying, getting seizures and heart attacks. If they said it's a weakened form of the virus then how weaken is it?
1/1/1	My aunt who is 91 years old was vaccinated with both Pfizer doses. She needed a new pacemaker so per protocol, they tested her & she was positive for COVID. She never got a symptom & would have never known. So the vaccine did help her even when she tested positive
0/1	My baby developed heart problems and both me and my wife were vaccinated shortly before conception. If there was something wrong with the vaccine, they wouldnt truly know yet.
1/1	My beloved parents at their honeymoon in the late 70s in Isfahan! They have been shielding for the past 32 months but got #COVID19 They just had their 1st #sinopharm vaccine a week ago!

0	My best friend and husband got both Pfizer vaccines..... now they both down with Covid. Sad but true
1/1	My best friend‚Äôs sister-in-law died last night from COVID. She was a devout Trump fan and refused to get vaccinated. Wake up people.
1/1	My biggest fear since the pandemic began was mum catching #Covid. She‚Äôs very much in the vulnerable category. I accompanied her today so she could get her #vaccine as she was anxious. I held her hand the whole way through. Such a relief!

1/1	My body, my choice. I chose to be proactive and protect myself by getting vaccinated. I'd rather risk getting a vaccine than a virus that causes blood clots, brain fog, lung damage, loss of taste and smell, even impotence. Some of these things can take months to resolve for a significant percentage of infected individuals.
1/-1	My body, my choice. Interesting how that applies to vaccination but not to abortion. By the same group of people, probably. Wonder if the Supreme Court has had any conversations about the convoluted thinking here.

Not only does he speak Swedish his native tunge, but also is learning english via Youtube on the iPad. The other day I heard him singing "happy birthday" in Arabic, he must have learned at daycare.. He's a very healthy boy full of life. These unvaccinated children will change the world!

0/0	My children have had covid and we wouldn't even have known but because we had to do a lateral flow test for a wedding, they had no symptoms whatsoever, so my children do not need to be vaccinated
0/0	My children should not be hurt to save some grandma
1/1	My childs father said he will sue me for vaccinating my son. So he got fully vaxxed last weekend. Texas.
0/0	My colleague at work, 24 years old and fit and healthy. Supposedly had covid in December as she tested positive after her flat mate had it, but no symptoms and didn't know she actually had it. Received the vaccine yesterday as she is a frontline worker, within an hour she felt Ill, shaking and achy. Within the next hour felt even worse. Eventually an ambulance was called and was taken to hospital as she couldn't breathe properly. Had to be put on a breathing machine, her words, for a few hours while lots of tests carried out. Was told that she isn't the only person this has happened to and the younger people seem to be reacting worse. Still in hospital and waiting on test results. Obviously this is not the normal reaction but why should healthy people be made to feel they have to take the vaccine.
0/0	My colleague died because of the AZ Jab
0/0	My colleague's wife got a first Pfizer shot a month ago. 3 hours after the needle she started feeling bad. Now a month later she's almost crippled. After 3rd blood analysis, apart from very low blood palatels, doctors say nothing we can do.
0/0	My college already got third vaccines shots and still got covid-19 two weeks ago. My doctor got his third covid-19 vaccine shots, his eyes and his voices blurred- not normal anymore.
0/1	My company is having a call next week with a doctor to convince us the vaccines are safe. I work with a lot of very smart autistic types if you know what I mean. I can't wait for the Q&A portion, if there is one.
0/0	My concern is by sending a message to your cells to replicate the "spike" and then to later attack that spike could be setting our bodies up for autoimmune disease
1/0	My concern is going to a vaccination site and then getting the virus there before the vaccine can kick in or getting the virus before the 2nd shot
0/0	My concern is that this is the first time mRNA has been used on humans in such a wide scale before. The experts say it is safe, but how can we know for sure that there will not be long term side effects? I'm not taking the vaccine for a while.
0/0	My concern isn't that it will "change your dna," but doesn't it alter that process and the creation of cells for the rest of your life?
0/0	My concerns about his advice about these ‚Äúsafe‚Äù vaccines. If they are so safe what can we Not sue the manufacturer of them if we suffer side effects or even death?
0	My condolences to those that have lost their souls to this injection. The rest of us must fight.
1/1	My condolences with all the family .i just. Lost my sis and dad 2 weeks apart in augest yes my sis didnt believe in the vaccine so didnt give it to dad so they lost there life to covid.please i want to tell the world get vaccinated it could save your life..
0/0/0/0	My conscience says do not take the vaccine
1/1	My country has secured vaccines, although not enough for the entire population. I hope I can get mine this year.
0/0/0/0	My county just reported its first omicron case. The fellow who got it had the vaccination and the booster. So, there‚Äôs that. Also, regardless of people‚Äôs vaccination status, viruses will continue to mutate. One cannot blame the nature of a virus on those who are not vaccinated.
1/0	My cousin is antivax and has had 3 children. All of them have autism.
1/1	My cousin is very ill in the hospital in south Texas. Please get your vaccine when you are able. She has Covid 19 and may not recover.
1/1	My cousin was an avid antivaxxer. He died a few days ago from Covid after spending months in the hospital. He went from a ventilator to a tracheotomy. He left all of his anti vax crap up all over his Facebook page up til the very end. It's horribly sad.
1/1	My coworker flipped from not wanting it at all to wanting it today after I spoke with him mid December. It is so refreshing knowing peoples stance isn‚Äôt necessarily in stone
0/0	My coworker told me his cousin in Pakistan got her shot but she still got covid and went to ICU. Why did this happen. I thought the shot was supposed to prevent this
1/1	My current actual guess is that the best current coronavirus vaccines, like Moderna's, probably actually work, are probably safe, and ought to be for sale right now to anyone who wants to be part of the experimental group. #ChangeMyView #ButPleaseCiteStatisticsToDoSo
0/0/0	My current expectation is NO, however I live in Australia, where COVID-19 is virtually eradicated.
1/1	My current stance on this is that vaccines are good
1/1	My dad after getting the vaccine just was tired more for a couple days! A billion times better than losing the biggest supporter in my life
1/1	My dad and all the people at his hospital got the vaccine last week, so far nothing bad.
1/1	My dad and aunt got Johnson and Johnson last month. No issues still
0/0	My dad and his girlfriend got their shots and his girlfriend had to go to the hospital last night because her arm has been in really bad pain. Is probably going to be even worse when they go get their second dose. I tried to warn them but they do not believe me
1/1	My dad and his wife yesterday too! Within a couple of weeks my whole family should be vaccinated (other than me, I‚Äôll be at the end). It‚Äôs a really good feeling.
1/1	My dad died from Covid, my wife is a mortician and has many ppl in her cooler because of this virus. My mom almost died and still has effects. I hope everyone does it, wish my dad had a few months for it to have came out.
1/1	My dad died from covid. He had the same thing I had pneumonia. I got vaccinated to protect myself and others around me. I still wear my mask and will always wear it.
1/1	My dad finally went for his first dose, I'm so thankful that he's pulled his head from the sand
1/1	My dad getting his Covid vaccine today. His message is: ‚ÄúIt was quick and painless. Make sure you all get it to protect your family, friends and your community! Thank you NHS!
1/1	My dad got his vaccination appointment for next week. As he's clinically vulnerable I couldn't be more excited about the rollout.
0/0	My dad is a doctor and he said the vaccines are fake
0/0	My dad is a doctor and of course he‚Äôs not taking that vaccine any time soon.
1/1	My dad is anti-vaxx and I‚Äôm using your video as one of my sources as why he‚Äôs absolutely insane.

1/1	My dad is half anti vacer soo when im 18 imma get a vaccine
1/1/1/1	My dad is high risk and got the first of two covid shots, he's getting his second one today and he has felt completely fine.
1/1	My dad just got his vaccine! I am so relieved for him. I‚Äôm also super proud of him. He‚Äôs surrounded by a lot of people who refuse to get it and who believe COVID is a hoax. So his decision was controversial - but he did the right thing. Go papa!
0/1	My dad just got over having COVID and he has been fully vaccinated for half a year
1/1	My dad recently passed away due to covid, and it pains me to see people not taking this seriously
1/1	My dad said he didn‚Äôt quite feel himself for a couple of days but nothing major. Like he said ... I‚Äôd rather this than catching covid.
1/1	My dad was ill for around 2-3 days but he is definitely better right now. He said that it‚Äôs normal for people to get ill for a few days after a vaccination.
0	My dad works in hospital they told him to pretend that he took it
0/0	My dad's 53 got diagnosed with terminal cancer at the beginning of lock down sadly. It's a no from his aswel.
1/1	My dad's got his vaccine letter, small bit of relief
0/1	My dad, when he was telling me about this, said that some manufacturers are so confident that the Oxford vaccine will work and be good that they're already mass-producing it.
1/1/1	My daughter & I helped an elderly lady who has no family get her vaccine she goes back April 14th for her second vaccine my daughter also gave her a ride to and from the doctor
0/0	My daughter and her husband are both hard working RN‚ÄôS on the Covid ward‚Ä¶.MOST of the patients they get have had the 2 shots AND the booster AND are getting Blood Clots! I hear it all! They are so depressed!
1/1	My daughter gets hers this afternoon. My husband and I in the morning. Please finish the 12-16 year old trials soon! But my goodness. How quickly it‚Äôs happened. My younger is getting three other vaccinations today. Just childhood stuff. Stuff we take for granted. So we‚Äôre ALL getting made healthier today and tomorrow. She doesn‚Äôt see it that way. LOL. Yeah, three needles. Five diseases she won‚Äôt get. How cool?? Maybe I can talk her sister into giving up her Kristy Kreme donut to her sister. :). Or just buying her one. Hell, for three shots, we‚Äôll get her three donuts. Three shots sucks.
1/1	My daughter got J&J last week..WITH NO SIDE AFFECTS!üôèüòäüò∑üëç
0/0	My daughter had her 1st Pfizer jab over 4 months ago. She is still suffering from side effects and has been unable to go to school. Weakness and pins and needles (especially from waist down) which made it difficult to even get out of bed at beginning. Headaches, stomachaches, backaches, heart beating fast and loudly, exhaustion and wanting to sleep all day. Drs say it‚Äôs due to an overactive immune system and there are others like this. I just wish these side effects are more talked about in media.
1/1	My daughter has a severe egg allergy and many vaccines are suspended in a type of egg protein. I strongly believe in vaccines because I have an autoimmune disease and heart condition. So I as a parent took my daughter to a specialist who did all her vaccines in divided dosages and we stayed in the office for 2 hours after each dosage. She is now a healthy 14 year old and has outgrown the egg allergy and has had ALL of her vaccines

0/0	My daughter has several friends that after getting one of these "vaccines", their cycle is a complete wreck now OR some completely stopped having their cycle altogether......25-30 year old women. Sorry folks---that's not normal for a "vaccine"......
0/0	My daughter has suffered severe vaccine injuries. Rushed to ER many times. Please do not down play it!
0/-1	My daughter is 23yo....she is autistic....at 18 months she was ahead of most children in milestones had a vocabulary of about 70-80 words....she received her 18 month needle ....became very ill....the next day she stopped talking and reverted into a world of her own...she didn't talk again for years and still to this day has communication issues
1/1	My daughter lives in Spain with her Spanish husband and they are coming back for the vaccine in early May. Just line it up at Walmart or Walgreens in NC. Plenty of spots open. No residency requirements. No big deal.
1/1	My daughter tested positive for covid so it's likely that mild cold we all had was actually covid. The vaccine we all got probably helped in making the symptoms be so mild.
0/0	My daughter works in an elderly facility. Three days ago they vaccinated the residents and 4 in her ward alone fell deathly ill. One had a heart attack. Many people in fact have died from this madman vaccine. Covid is a hoax and the vaccine will kill you. Don't be stupid.
1	My daughters best friend is just getting over a COVID infection. She was double vaccinated almost 6 months ago. Good thing because she was hit hard. Now her vaccinated 14 year old son is sick with it. Omicron is dangerous without the vaccines.
1/1	My distinctly non-religious Dad will be going to church on a Sunday morning for the first time in my life this week. For his COVID vaccination. I couldn't be happier.
0/0/0/0/0/0	My doctor of many years who I trust told me to avoid the vaccine
1/1	My doctor prescribed my vaccination because of my health issues, I haven't had any problems with the shot
0/0	My doctor said to NEVER give this vax or any to be honest. Glad I have doc I can trust to be honest.
1/1	My doctor told me no time soon because the virus keeps mutating into more contagious variants. Getting vaccinated is our only safeguard preventing serious symptoms and/or death! Much like how our yearly flu shot works! I agree.
0/0	My doctor's office called today, and said I needed to schedule my covid 19 vaccine. I told them no thanks. I get bad side effects to vaccines, and this one is only in experimental phase.
0/1	My doctors practice basically harassed me regarding this and why I refused to take it, saying do I want to die, do I not want to see my family anymore and do I not want to go on holidays? No I just don't want nor need this "vaccine".
0/0	My doctors wife was 8 days hospitalized after the second dose.
1/1	My elderly mom got her 1st shot yesterday and is doing well..was the mederna brand
1/1	My elderly parents and sister just did last week. Arm pain and trouble sleeping due to the arm pain but otherwise we're okay. It cleared up fast. 2nd Pfizer shot had more reaction. Moderna seems more pleasant.

0/-1	My exact thoughts late last night, nobody is any freer than March 2020, vaxxed or Prochoice, & they never will be if this debacle continues
0/0/-1	My exhusbands father just died 2 weeks after getting his 2nd shot.
0/1/0	My experience with it was bit harsher. Had really bad flu symptoms that kicked in about 12/13 hours after my shot. Was miserable for about a day. Was ok the next day. Still a minimal price to pay for the benefit. My other symptoms include feeling upbeat and optimistic.
1/1	My family all got Moderna and they were so happy to get it both doses.
0/0	My family and I are not taking the death in a bottle. We don't wear masks or social distance either!!!
0/0	My family and I got corona but survived so we are not going to get the vaccine!

1/1	My father completed both doses of Covishied vaccine before 15 days...He is completely fine.(note : He has no any disease like diabetes,BP or heart problems)
0/0	My father died by a experimental drug given to my father by Pfizer
0/0	My father died from the vaccine, but nobody will take responsbility. I warn you all to not take any vaccine until more research has been done. It feels so rushed.
1/0	My father got the whooping cough when he was 7 and DIED! True story. He somehow was given 50 additional years of life through some miracle or deal with the devil, but later on his father ended up with polio! The ENTIRE family had to move to a city for treatment. I guess he was lucky because I don't recall him having any lasting medical problems. This is why my family vaccinates.
0/-1	My father got vaccinated on 15th March, 2021 and some days later he started having hiccups and it lasted like 9 days then he died. He was a strong man with no serious health issue. god help humanity

1/1	My father got vaccinated the other day. Good for him
1/1	My father had polio. It changed his life forever. A simple vaccination would have prevented a lifetime of suffering. Whenever I read people nay-saying vaccinations I am shocked at their lack of education and insight.
1/1	My father is a doctor treating covid patients. He has taken both shots of covishield and have got no side effects.
0/0	My father passed away due to vaccine he was healthy happy he got his first shot of Pfizer vaccine and the next day he passed away !
0/-1	My father was close to getting it today but then changed his mind after hearing his friends and family either fainted, getting sick and having strong pain in their bodies.
1/1	My father(a doctor) got vaccinated yesterday and he has been ill ever since. I‚Äôm honestly getting more skeptical of this vaccine because there have been many cases of people dying because of the vaccine. UPDATE: My dad was ill for around 2-3 days but he is definitely better right now. He said that it‚Äôs normal for people to get ill for a few days after a vaccination. So don‚Äôt worry about the Covid vaccine...
0/0	My fathers oncologist asked him if he had gotten the vaccine or the booster to which my father said no, oncologist replied good.
0/0	My female friend got her vaccine and has not had her period since. Not pregnant. Take it as it is
1/-1	My fever hit 101 a few hours ago so I took 500mg Tylenol. Feeling better. Drinking lots & was able to eat something. I have no regrets though. I would rather go through 24 hours of feeling ill vs getting covid.
1/1	My first AZ vaccine gave me a high fever and chills for several hours and then very tired the next day. I am 65 years old. I‚Äôm hoping the second shot will go easier
1/-1	My first Modena dose only gave me a sore arm. My second dose gave me chills, headaches and a slight fever for a day.
1/1	My first Pfizer dose left me a bit sleepy for a day. The second dose left me with "cold sweats," loss of appetite, serious exhaustion and flue like symptoms for two days. It was worth it. I'm 72 and interested to hear what younger people are experiencing
1/1	My first dose was super easy I felt nothing but a sore arm. I get my second in a couple of weeks
1/1	My first one is tomorrow
1/1	My first one was super easy too. Keep hearing the second one is the one messing with people.
1/1	My five year old granddaughter got her second dose January 7, with no side effects. Now I will have to be honest and say she did have covid this week, but all she had was 2 times of throwing up for three hours. That was it! I credit the vaccine for such mild symptoms.
1/1	My five year old grandson is having his first shot next week, as part of a clinical trial of the vaccine on children. His three year old brother is on a waiting list. They're medical pioneers, those two!
0/0	My friend (or relative) told me not to get vaccinated
1/1	My friend did the covid19 vaccine yesterday and had no side effects.. I will do it too!
0/0	My friend died today after receiving the vaccine, 12 hours earlier. Shortness of breath with heart failure followed. She was perfectly fine. A teacher at the high school is in ICU after receiving the vaccine. So I ask you, are cases being ignored at this time to benefit the vaccine being used or are more people having side effects that are not being reported with the relationship to the vaccine?
1/1	My friend got gbs triggered when he contracted covid. Got hospitalized. Few weeks later went to get vaccine, no problem. Got second shot, no problem.
1/0	My friend got the shot and tested positive for covid. Hasn't been sick in 10 years until the vaccine.

0/0	My friend has been vaccinated 3 times and is now in intensive care.
0/0	My friend has bels palsy. Another had a heart attack a week after 2nd shot. Those side effects dont seem small to me. Coupled with these companies are not responsible for anything that happens to these patients, ill wait 5 more years to see the long term effects of this experimental vaccine
0/0	My friend put two young men (children) through medical school. One is an M.D. And one is in medical science. They are now both in their early 50's. They advised their Mom and Dad to NOT take the vaccine. I might add that both parents had the China virus. Their children said they do not know the long term effects of the vaccine. I to am following the advice of their children. Both the parents and myself are in our late 70's and healthy. I don't think they would give the same advise to people who are sickly. But then again they might suggest strict quarantine. I respect them and will follow the same advise until told differently.
0/0	My friend stop beating around the bush, the man was healthy and died after taking the vaccine, so if one intakes a poison and it doesn't kill the person on the spot but it kill him a few days later does it mean it wasn't the poison that killed him, ofcourse it was
0	My friend took the vaccine and died yesterday. I doubt he‚Äôs the only one.
0/0	My friend was injured from the vaccine, his doctor refused to treat him and admit it was the vax
1/1	My friend went through the trial for AstraZaneca and didn't even get sick from it. She did have the actual vaccine
0/0	My friend works on icu and has seen first hand side effects from the vaccine. Probably a clue as to why she won‚Äôt go and get it!
0/-1	My friend's 83 year old mom, was getting on pretty well for her age. After the second vaccine she development body tremors and had to move in with her daughters and is now not well and insentient. She used to be very sharp, and now is repeating herself all the time.
1/1	My friend's sister died of Covid yesterday. Her funeral is today. This really brings it home to me. Whichever scientists can succeed in destroying Covid and giving us back human life - not the lives lost, but the lives still living - those scientists are indeed heroes.
1	My friend's wife is a nursing home worker. She's for whatever reason totally opposed to getting vaccinated. Fucking stupid.

0/0	My friends daughter was forced into getting it for work, and she now has to have a pacemaker due to heart attack as a direct result from clots. (This WAS a perfectly healthy 28 year old nurse who ran 5 miles every morning) My wife's friend was immune compromised, and decided to get it, went blind in one eye after the 1st shot, STILL went back for the 2nd, and went blind in the other eye. I've had very little people in my life get it.
0/0	My friends girlfriend got it and woke up paralyzed the next day!!! Good luck with the experimental vaccine

0/0	My friends who got their COVID vaccination and booster shot came down with COVID last week. Can someone explain that?
1/1/1/1	My friends younger sister had a temporarily weakened immune system due to treatment for her skin, and she caught chicken pox from an unvaccinated kid who had gone to school without knowing he had it. This is a less extreme case but it shows how easily people‚Äôs choices effect everyone else.
0/0	My girl friend got all 3 shots... still got covid... so now what?
1/1	My girlfriend and I just got out first Moderna shots last night!
1/1/1	My girlfriend is one of those shots getting her first dose. The last person in my life, outside of two anti vaxxers unfortunately, to begin their vaccination regiment. It will be nice to start seeing everyone again soon.
1/1	My girlfriend received both doses of the Pfizer vaccine. And about a week or two after the second dose, she had contact with a positive patient at her hospital before they knew the patient had COVID. They called her in to do a nasal swab and the test came back negative. Take that for whatever you will. Its not guaranteed that she would've gotten sick without the vaccine. But I knew eventually this would happen. I knew that some day eventually she would be exposed without an N95/negative pressure room. And potentially drag it home.

1/1	My grandmother (67) took single dose of vaccine two weeks ago and tested positive yesterday... She's asymptomatic and it's severity is quite minor...her vaccination surely did help her fight covid. She will soon take the second dose as well.

1/1	My hospital is swamped with covid patients. We just emptied out another ward to accommodate more covid patients. And it‚Äôs not even winter yet. Every (living) patient I worked with last night had covid. At this point, I‚Äôm willing to gamble on a vaccine, because the odds of a negative side effect as bad (or as contagious) as covid are small.
1/1	My hubby and I had Covid Nov 2020. We had our 1st vaccine dose March 17th. We both had sore arms and felt a little flu for a few days, but no major symptoms and it was definitely not as bad as having Covid! We are scheduled to have second dose Apr 14th and will get the second dose.
1/1	My hubby and I had our first dose of Pfizer today. Nothing felt so far except for pain on vaccinated site for the first 15-20 mins and occassional muscle pain in the first 30 mins. After that, nothing felt again. Still feeling good :)
0/0	My huge respect for everyone who speaks about vaccine sides effects
1/1	My husband 75 and I at 69 took Moderna vaccine 2 weeks ago. We are looking forward to having 2nd vaccine in 2 weeks. Zero side effects
1/1	My husband an l live in Bruce County we are in our 60s hubby is a diabetic l have high blood pressure we was wanting to find out where to go to get our vaccine shots
1/1	My husband and I are in our sixties and we are both fully vaccinated with Moderna. We both got the booster shot in one arm and the flu shot in the other arm one after the other. No problems of any kind except for 2 sore arms for maybe 2 days. We‚Äôre doing good.
1/1	My husband and I are so grateful that Pfizer is trying to make us safe..thank you
1/1	My husband and I each have had our first, and will get the next in a few weeks. Please please everyone get the vaccine.
1/1/1	My husband and I got our first shots today. We are relieved and proud to be doing our part.
1/1	My husband and I got the Pfizer vaccine and I would do it again in a heartbeat!! We had no side affects at all. So happy I got it!!!
0/0	My husband and I had COVID at the same time. I had it pretty bad but my husband had several morbidities and only had a small fever and headache one day. Neither of us had the vaccine. So the premise that you get a lighter case if your vaccinated did not apply in this case
1/1	My husband and I have just had our first Oxford vaccine and thankful for it!
0/-1	My husband and I have not had the vaccine yet because we are worried about vaccine side effects.
1/1	My husband and I just got first vaccination-Pfizer. In 3 weeks will have next one, I hope
1/1	My husband and I received our first COVID 19 shot last week! We are so happy to have gotten it and look forward the second one. Thank you CDC
1/1	My husband and I received our second doses today. My parents and essential worker children have been vaccinated. I know this wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without your leadership. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts President Biden
1/1	My husband and I will be getting the vaccine just as soon as we are contacted by our health care provider that it is available.
0/0	My husband and I will not be taking the shot because it was rushed to fast and we have been living in a tent for over a year.
1	My husband and his coworker just waited in line for over 4 hours but they both got their first dose of the COVID vaccine!
1/1	My husband died Friday of covid. He wasn't an actor and this covid pandemic is very real. Please get vaccinated
1/1	My husband got covid! He was really sick. I want the vaccine!!!!
1/1	My husband got his appointment through for tomorrow. I know more than a few who have had their vaccinations. Well done NHS.
1/1	My husband had Covid in March and almost died. He is still on oxygen. It's a terrible virus. I will get the shot when it becomes available.
0/0	My husband is 2x vaxed and I am not. We contracted Covid mid January. He had it longer and his symptoms were worse. Thankfully, we are well now. That vaccine is worthless.
1/1	My husband is 78 and will get his syringe today last March. I 75 have to wait my turn!
1/1	My husband is in the Oxford trial. He had a strong 36 hour reaction to the first shot but nothing to the second shot. Anecdotally that seems par for the course for that one. I think it's different for every vaccine and every person.
0	My husband's cousin is in the hospital after taking her first dose. Her limbs are now immobile as a result of taking the vaccine and her kidneys are starting to have problems. She's been in the hospital for weeks.
1/1	My husband's coworker died yesterday. Unvaxxed, early 50s. He'd been in the ICU for weeks and intubated for around 2 weeks. Couple of adult kids and one in high school. So pointless.
0/0	My hypothesis is vaccines are causing a larger percentage of excess death than is being considered currently. You have in no way disproved this. With the makers 100% indemnified and claims of damage to be paid by our gov
1/1	My idiot husband is a CT tech and is refusing to get it right now. Wants to wait to see how it goes. I'm an SLP at a hospital and I get it on Wednesday. Unfortunately, he sees 20x the amount of COVID patients I do.
1/0	My immune system does a whole lot better...without all the side effects.
1/0	My immune system does not need to be stimulated. I will not be taking this either..
0/0	My immune system has let me down less times than the government. Guess who I'm siding with.
0/0	My immune system hasn't been trained by any such "vaccine"', so I'm still good.
0/-1	My immune system is 100% against covid-19.
0/0	My immune system is 99.998 percent effective after 50 years. It will never be compromised by this poison. Ever.
0/0	My immune system is far more proficient
0/0	My immune system is fine, so I'd prefer not to infect myself with poison that's going to affect me negatively in years to come
0/0	My immune system is just fine .
0/0	My immune system is more effective than the Pfizer vaccine.
0/0	My immune system is more effective than the vaccine. I'll take my vitamin D and zinc thank you for your concern.
0/0	My immune system is the most precious wealth I possess. No vaccine for me, thanks.
0/0	My immune system is their for a reason,if someone chooses to receive it I respect that ,they better respect my choice also.
0/0/0/0	My immune system is working just fine.
0/0	My immune system responded quite nicely when I got covid and did it's job by defeating the virus. Didn't even have to inject anything into my body to trick it into producing antibodies. It did it all on it's own.
0/0	My immune system told me everything will be fine .
0/0	My immune system works better than any vaccine in the entrie WORLD
0/0	My immune system works better than any vaccine in the entrie WORLD!!!
1	My immune system's wiser cuz i got the Pfizer vaccine
0/0	My immune systom is 100% better and worth a lot more than to take the risk to take something with no garentee. God made me with His immunity and that is a garentee.
1/1	My in-laws have their covid vaccine tomorrow (at @RJAH_NHS , I'm pleased to say!) and my parents, in the over-65s group, will hopefully be seen by the end of the month. It's such a relief to see those closest to us getting protection
0/0	My issue here with vaccines is if someone is forcing me to put something in my body. That I don‚Äôt want. For me that‚Äôs unacceptable.
1/1	My issue with no vaxers is not what they do for themselves, I could not care less. The problem is that they are occupying a lot of the beds that should go to cancer patients.
1/1	My ist dose I don't Have sides effect same in my second dose .in I sleep good it's brieliant
0/0	My job is offering the vaccine on Thursday. I told them you will have to hold me down if you expect me to take it
0/0	My job offered me $500 to get the vaccine .. I‚Äôm still not getting that shit lol
0/0	My kid is perfectly healthy and he had no polio vaccine.
0/0	My kids ain't taking that sh*t...and if you ain't down with that, I've got two words for yaaaaaa...........
1/1	My kids always got booster shots growing up for measles, mumps etc. This is no different. This is how we beat this awful disease.
0/0	My kids are not taking it
0/0	My kids will NOT get the jab!!! They don't want it either!
0	My kids will never be vaccinated and I will continue to fight for the choice to not vaccinate. After all the shots you give your damn kids, they will not be any better protected, all the while you are putting them at risk for everything else these vaccines cause.
1/1	My late 80s grandparents both just had their second dose of Pfizer and 60 year old mother had her first AZ a few weeks back. Feeling a lot better about the country opening up with all that considered!
1/1	My little brother & his wife refused to get vaccinated. He passed away last month while in the ICU due to Covid while his wife also sick & in the ICU was holding his hand. Our hearts were shattered & will never be the same! Please, please get vaccinated!
0/0	My long COVID symptoms worsened after the vaccine and no doctor wants to acknowledge that. They‚Äôre in denial and treating me like a crazy lady when many other people are going through the same
1/1	My lovely in-laws got their covid vaccine today! I know how much it means to them - and have seen how much it means to the thousands of people who have been vaccinated across Shropshire, Telford & Wrekin. It's definitely a career highlight to be a small part of it.
1/1	My main concern is not whether or not I get infected, but whether I spread it to someone less fortunate.
0/0	My main concern is that in this vaccine mRNA is used instead of the virus itself. This type of vaccine has never been used before ever. I do get my vaccines but they are different from the covid vaccine using dead viruses or inactive viruses. So I doubt if this type of vaccine (mRNA) is truly safe or later will be proven unsafe.
1/1	My main issue is that the same people that think that the vaccine is unsafe because less than 1 in 1,000,000 have had a side affect, were the same people touting that 99.9% of people that get covid are fine.
0/0	My main issue it was rushed to the market for something that you have over a 99% survival rate. I‚Äôm not one of those the government is trying to chip us I just feel that I don‚Äôt want to be a Guenia pig to this vaccine
0/0	My main problem with making the COVID vaccine mandatory is the lack of research behind it
0/0	My mathematics teacher got sick from the vaccine, and my girlfriends grandma had a stroke 3 days after her vaccination. My uncle got sick from the vaccine, and so did one of my cousins. Idgaf what school requires, or what anyone says....im not getting that vaccine. Im just glad that i have the right to deny it, people in most other countries wont get that chance.....
0/0	My memory is getting SO bad I have no choice but to blame the vaccine
0/0	My mindset is just to be last person in the country to get the vaccine. It would be selfish to deny someone the vaccine by being vaccinated ahead of anyone when supply is so limited. I figure 20+ years from now I might be within 10 years of being on a 5 year waiting list for the vaccine. But I will give up my place in line to the person behind me out of politeness.
1/1	My mom and all her friends are Facebook researchers and I‚Äôll never forget this one lady saying ‚Äúwhy do we even need vaccines, like, there hasn‚Äôt been a measles breakout in decades‚Äù like yes??? Because people were being vaccinated ü§¶üèΩ‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚ôÄÔ∏è people who spend ten minutes on google and think they have a better grasp on medical things than doctors that have spent years studying medicine never fail to make my blood boil
1/0	My mom and brother are probably going to take it but im personally gonna wait a bit and see if people start having issues or not, if noone had issues sure i'll take it
1/0/0/1	My mom and brother are probably going to take it but im personally gonna wait a bit and see if people start having issues or not, if noone had issues sure i'll take it but if they do i'll wait a bit longer
1/1	My mom and my grandparents got it a couple of days ago. I can‚Äôt wait to got mine **
1/1/1/-1/1/1	My mom didn‚Äôt get my vaccine very often and I always got sick, but recently she became full antivaxx that I now have to rely on my dad to help me get my vaccine. So antivaxx moms can say oh props to your mom, shut up, I recently got the flu because I didn‚Äôt get the vaccine it was horrible don‚Äôt put your kid through it!!!
1/1/1/1	My mom didn‚Äôt vaccinate me, I am proud to say as of today I‚Äôm fully vaccinated. I‚Äôm 24.
0/0	My mom died a few days after taking the 2nd vaccine shot
0/-1	My mom got her 1st Pfizer dose 13 days ago and now she had COVID :/
0/0	My mom got the COVID vaccine and now she‚Äôs sick. Rip
1/1	My mom got the j&j last Friday she's fine. I'm not worried at all.....obviously vigilant if any symptoms come up. I would still get the j&j had I not gotten Pfizer
0/0	My mom got transverse myelitis from a flu shot.. it has ruined her life...
0	My mom had a friend who shortly after the vaccine was hospitalized with extremely high blood pressure and has had nerve problems ever since
0/0	My mom has SEVERE arthritis simply from a flu vaccine
0/0	My mom has said that she doesn‚Äôt want to take the COVID 19 vaccine. She says this is because the vaccine has ‚Äúkilled almost everyone who took it‚Äù.
0/0	My mom in LB received a whatsapp list of 10 categories who should not receive covid vaccine. It includes very random categories, like those with high blood pressure. As far as I know, only pregnant women are advised against it, or am I missing something?
1/-1	My mom in New York got hers. Honestly, she is who i was worried about. I'm young and I can handle the virus.
1/1	My mom is a nurse. When some of her fellow nurses received the first dose of Pfizer and Moderna, it was so effective that they didn't get covid even when their entire family tested positive.
1/1	My mom is a nurse. When some of her fellow nurses received the first dose of Pfizer and Moderna, it was so effective that they didn't get covid even when their entire family tested positive. Mind you the 1st dose only give you 50% protection. These two mRNA vaccines are revolutionizing vaccine technology and have no real competition
1/1	My mom is fine, and she got the vaccine months ago. My dad is fine, and he got it last week. Care to explain why nobody is dying to the vaccine besides allergic reactions? And I mean... of the vaccine, not getting the vaccine and dying of something random and unrelated the next day.
0/-1	My mom is very sick from her vaccine. It started 12 hours after first shot
0/0	My mom lost her left eye due to the vaccine... FJB
0/0	My mom made me get the vaccine. And I swear if my kid comes out being messed up then I‚Äôm gonna be pissed.
1/-1	My mom received one of the trial vaccines back in the day. My grandmother signed the waiver because she had seen what polio could do to people first hand. Needless to say, my mom has been encouraging people to take the Covid vaccines ASAP.
0/0/0/0	My mom said her friends took it and some of them had seizures. I don‚Äôt think I am taking it.
1/1	My mom says that the covid 19 will end if WE ALL GET VACCINATED.
1/0	My mom telling me conspiracy theories that the Covid vaccine will make me infertile. Like ok??? Two for one deal???
1/1	My mom texted me that she and my dad got their first COVID vaccine today. I never thought somebody getting a shot would make me happy.
1/1	My mom vaccinates me and I‚Äôm fine... I just have a panic attack every time I go to the doctor to get one bc I HATE NEEDLES anyways... VACCINATE YO KIDS
1/1	My mom was able to get it though. No signs of autism, but side effects included her cussing at the NFL game.
1	My mom was born in '55. When she was in the second grade she got German Measels followed immediately by mumps on both sides.. She barely survived so you can bet that I got vaccinated.
1/1	My mom went back to work today. My dad's going back tomorrow. I couldn't be happier that things are getting back to normal this week and once again, so grateful I still did not catch Covid. Thank God for this damn vaccine.
1/1	My mom, 74, but having been through 2 bouts of cancer so is at higher risk, just got her 1st vaccine Syringe dose (she lives in Oceanside, California). OMG the relief!! Folded hands #VaccinesWork
1/1	My mom, who is in her 90s and still quite sharp (and gratefully vaccinated against COVID-19, I will add), says that if people could remember kids sick with disease -- polio, measles, mumps -- it would be a reality check for the anti-vaxers. The fact that vaccines have worked and wiped out not only diseases but the memory of the horrible damage that polio can do is a double edged sword
1/1	My moms a healthcare worker and she‚Äôs getting her first dose of the vaccine today
1/1/1	My moms a healthcare worker and she‚Äôs getting her first dose of the vaccine today and she‚Äôs kind of nervous, thank you for this video it helps a lot
0/0/0/0	My mother died of covid one week ago 5 or 6 days after receiving the first dose of the vaccine...i will never take it
0/0	My mother got 1st shot of Pfizer hours later ----- same day had a stroke, I will never trust this vaccine
0/0	My mother got sick, and I know of two other people who got sick right after getting it. She had to get it for work, but NAH im good. That aint no coincidence !
0/-1	My mother got the vaccine and she‚Äôs been very sick I‚Äôm worried to death she has Covid.
0/1	My mother had her second jab and her shoulder is in constant pain now, the medical professionals have been very good with her and have said it was a wrongly administered covid shot that has caused her shoulder muscles issues.
1/1	My mother had polio Like many of her peers who contracted the virus it caused childhood paralysis. The vaccine iradicated it. #Vaccinate
1/1	My mother has MS. Her immune system is severely weakened as a result. Today she got her COVID vaccine. Today I am very thankful.
1/1	My mother in #PuertoRico got her second dose of the #COVID19 #vaccine today. She is also helping other older adults to get vaccinated. I cannot be happier.
0/0	My mother in law is fully vaccinated (she's a health professional) and has gotten covid twice now. Explain to me the purpose of the vaccines again?
1/1	My mother received her second dose about a week ago, and it feels like a huge weight off my shoulders.
1/1	My mother refused to get the vaccines, later one of my uncles died 'cause of Covid and she realized it was THAT SERIOUS, so she got vaccinated and is wearing her mask properly. XOXO
0/0	My mother told me not to get vaccinated, she hasnt done it, me and my wife or kids hasn't done it either. I have a bad feeling about this vaccine
1/1	My mother was a first time mother in the mid-late 90s, you know when the utterly horrific suggestive paper that linked autism and vaccines. She ended up being very very sceptical but when she saw that it wasn‚Äôt true, she got me and my brother vaccinated. Sadly for me, I wasn‚Äôt vaccinated for chicken pox and got it twice but I think it was mild because I didn‚Äôt get any complications from it. I was some what fortunate in that regard. At least my mum learned and got us vaccinated; although I did miss the vital ones like the mmr vaccines because I was in another country when I was supposed to get it. I got it when I could when I moved back to my home country.
0	My mother was fully vaccinated though she got infected with covid and passed away.
0/0	My mother's neighbor, a healthy oncologist, had a brain aneurysm within a week of getting his vaccine. He died a few days later. No news report with him or investigation to see if his death was related to the vaccine. Just saying, there could be more unreported cases of this (or similar deaths) occuring.
0/0	My mother-in-law has been fully vaccinated and still got Covid (even went to the ER twice) while me and my wife, my father-in-law, brother-in-law and sister-in-law all had covid last year, and never showed any symptoms when my mother-in-law got it. Her husband kept getting negative test results. I'm not anti vaccine, I'm just not not a fan of getting a shot that doesnt work
0/0	My mother‚Äôs healthcare place called to get permission to give my 90-year-old mother one of the vaccines and I said no way
0/0	My motto is: No mask No Shutdowns No test, trace nor chip And they can take that poisonous vax and shove it up their butts
1/1	My mum and stepdad got booked in for their vaccinations at the end of this week. I turn 40 at the end of this month and it‚Äôs the best birthday present I could ask for! Thank you to everyone who is helping to fight this awful virus x
1/1	My mum got her Covid-19 vaccine today and I could not be happier
1/1	My mum had her first Covid jab today. Thank you #Science and thank you to the @NHS and all the volunteers helping to run the #vaccination programme. So grateful
1/1	My mum had her first dose of the #COVIDVaccine today! Her response on receiving it, ‚ÄúBrilliant. I felt elated afterwards, simply because it brings hope.‚Äù
1/1	My mum has had her vaccination...very happy. #CovidVaccine #AstraZeneca
1/0	My mum just had covid, and my auntie has it at the moment. It is people like you who are responsible for children losing their parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. Shame on you - listen to science.
0/0	My mum looked like she had covid after the vaccine. Struggling to breath. Hasn't been out this whole year and has been fine. Takes the vaccine now looks close to death. Same with my dad. He's just got over cancer and was doing pretty well. Takes this rubbish and again now looks like he's close to death. Take it if you want to take it but I won't be.
1/1	My mum refused vaccine.. shes currently in ICU having got severe covid..her heart stopped in the hospital..im actually glad im vaccinated because seeing her struggle so breathe and be so confused and unable to speak...it will haunt me
1/1	My mum, who is on immune system suppression drugs, has just had a test to see if she has developed any covid antibodies, having been vaccinated 7 weeks ago. None. She has none. This is why everyone else has to get vaccinated. Please.
1/1	My nana had it a few weeks ago and is feeling fine
0/0	My nearly 79 year old unvaccinated mother had Covid 3 weeks ago.She's had worse colds.
0/0	My neighbor died from a massive heart attack the day after she got the vaccine. She was a healthy and active 58 year old woman with no prior heart condition.
0/0	My neighbor died from the second moderna dose! I still have yet to see someone suffer/die from covid itself.
0/0	My neighbor who was a 85 year old woman died 15 days after the covid vaccine and that tells it all
0/0	My neighbour had the oxford poison, two hours later had a severe reaction, ended up in hospital for 4 days with bells palsy, in severe pain with permanent liver damage.
0/0	My neighbour has had the covid jab, she now has headaches constantly and feels ill
1/1	My nine year old had no issues with the vaccine. I'm thankful for his chance to make antibodies without the organ damage the virus causes
1/1	My old folks got it a week ago, going back in a couple weeks for round 2. Huge weight off my mind.
0/0	My only issue with taking it is whether it‚Äôs safe. Has safety been compromised due to the rush to get it out.
1/1	My opinion that appears to piss off everyone I know. I think if a parent doesn't vaccinate their kid then it should be an issue for CPS.
1/-1	My opinion: if a person chooses not to get vaccinated, they should work really hard to strengthen their immune system: get plenty vitamin D, keep blood pressure and blood sugar levels under control, maintain a healthy weight and consider taking zinc supplements and black seed oil. Keep the gut healthy by consuming plenty prebiotics and probiotics.
0/0	My other half got vaccinated. Been sick ever since. Don?t know if it?s related. I refuse to allow anyone tell me what to do. My body. My choice. Something like that anyway
1/1	My other half just booked in for his jabs - there is a 12 week gap between first and second.
1/1	My otherwise healthy nine year old son is in the hospital with COVID pneumonia. Protect our children. Get vaccinated.
1/1/1/1	My overall opinion on vaccines is that they are good :D
0/0	My own doctor almost died after getting the vaccine. He advised me not to take it!
0/0	My papa died from the cv shot! My pos mother told him he had to get it to see his GF of 26+ years. (She lied to him so he would get it!) He got it and his heart rate dropped below 50. He had to be admitted because his heart rate kept dropping. It killed him!
1/1	My parental grandmother had 6 kids. She once told me the happiest day of her life wasn‚Äôt when any of them were born. It was the day they announced there was a polio vaccine. She said was so relieved and thankful she would no longer have to worry about one of them dying or being a life long cripple from the disease. She died 10 years ago at 87. I wonder what she would think of those out there now that are refusing the Covid vaccine.
1/1	My parents (aged 72 and 74) just had their first dose of Pfizer vaccine!!
1/1/1	My parents always made sure I got the vaccinations that were necessary as a kid and I'm really glad they did.
1/1/1/1/1	My parents and my extended family will be vaccinated before I am as they all work as nurses at the biggest hospitals in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.
1/1	My parents are conservatives, but I'm so glad they actually took Covid seriously and got vaccines as soon as they possibly could, despite the constant barrage of misinformation from Fox News and other conservative media.
1/1	My parents are in their 80's and have had the first dose of the Moderna vaccine. They only had the soreness they would have with flu vaccines, no other effects. They didn't take any aspirin or NSAIDS. My brother had a terrifying case of covid-19 and suffers long-haul effects. He says: "You don't want to get Covid!" I will get the vaccine as soon as I'm eligible.
1/1	My parents both got their first #COVID19 vaccine today. Such a relief.
1/1	My parents both have taken vaccine now, so excited!
1/1	My parents both tested positive last 2 weeks. Both completed booster. Boleh berkebun(depan rumah) tanpa masalah. 1 week later, tested again. Negative. Covid-19 vaccine does not prevent you from infection. But it prevents from severe infection. Take your booster
1/1	My parents didn‚Äôt take it but I will! Lets get this over with.
1/1	My parents got the 2-shot vaccine, they're doing perfectly fine c: I'm getting the vaccine next week! Edit: I just got my first dose of the vaccine a few days ago! My arm was sore obviously, but I'm perfectly fine right now =) I'll update again once I get my second dose.
1/1	My parents got their first dose of Moderna this evening. Grateful doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe how I feel.
1/1	My parents got their second dose of the vaccine today in Himachal Pradesh no fever no weakness no other symptoms they are feeling quiet good and happy.... Waiting for my turn now
1/1	My parents got vaccinated today. Every time I think about it, I cry. I am so thankful they made it. My heart absolutely breaks for all those with parents who did not.
1/1	My parents had their first recently, thank you to everyone in NHS and the Army as they are helping out dispense injection for them.
1/1	My parents have successfully had their first vaccinations üôåüèª Few side effects for Mam but otherwise all well & good! #vaccine #torfaen
1/1	My parents have taken Astrazeneca jab almost one month ago in Bangladesh and they are completely fine.
1/1	My parents just got their first #vaccine shots and I am so relieved Smiling face
1/1	My parents received both doses and they later got infected.Yes, the symptoms were mild and treatment was done at home. Vaccine helps.
1/-1	My parents told me I was the reason they got the vaccine, & sent me this long sob text about how they really don‚Äôt want it but it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm passionate about it‚Ä¶come to find out their jobs made it mandatory. Manipulation at its finest.
1/1/-1	My parents took Covishield at one hospital but now that hospital has Covaxin as part of this updated list. Do these centres switch between these medication and is this list updated often? Would make it easier to know where to schedule the 2nd dose. Thank you.
1/1/1/1/-1/0	My parents vaccinated me. Now I'm an adult.
1/1	My parents were vaccinated and feel good about it
1/1	My partner and I got our boosters in Scarborough at a Mosque. I got moderna because I'm 30+. My partner got Pfizer because they're 25 and under
1/1	My partner is fully vaccinated against COVID. Words cannot describe how much relief I feel. I'm hoping it's my turn in the next couple months.
1/1	My personal opinion is that you should get the vaccine if it's offered to you. You're right the system is broken (corrupt governments etc), but you won't fix the system by skipping the vaccine. You passing up the vaccine won't necessarily mean it goes to someone who needs it more-- most likely it'll go to someone else who is in your same position (a friend of a politician who doesn't need it the most).
0/0	My plans are‚Ä¶ to not get the vaccine. Stop the bs propaganda.
0	My platelets are borderline low already. Makes me wonder if I‚Äôm more susceptible to ITP from this vaccine.
1/1	My pregnant sister basically had to tell my parents they weren't allowed to see their first grandchild until they got vaccinated. They grumbled about it for a bit, but they did it!
1/1	My pregnant wife and I got our Moderna boosters and we are perfectly good. Following Dr Faucis recommendations we avoided Covid until now. I had high fewer after my booster shot so that I know it stimulated my immune system and in the case of real infection my body will react immediately. We are a fully vaccinated happy American family.
1/1	My pregnant wife and I got ours a couple weeks ago, had a sore arm for a day or so, that‚Äôs about it. Herd immunity could completely eradicate this virus. Unfortunately looks like there are enough antivaxxer conspiracy theorists to ensure that the virus never goes away. Millions will die bc of some stupid facebook misinformation.
0/0	My president Joe Biden told me to not trust the trump vaccine and that is why I am not taking. Now that we elected him they say it's safe 2 days after the election? I'm all set.
0/0	My private physician and his family of 4 all had Covid. Mild symptoms. He recommends the vaccine. I told him no thanks and he said yeah, it‚Äôs best to wait a few months. I‚Äôm waiting more than a few months.
0/0	My problem with the vax is long term effects of the shot.
0/0	My protection is the Lord Jesus Christ himself God did not have his hands in these vaccines I believe it in my heart and in my spirit God makes no mistakes!
0/0	My question is, how is it acceptable that the virus vaccine had been discovered immediately and is not a threat to human life while HIV aids had been there for decades without a vaccine to immune rhe human body form HIV? ü§¶‚ôÄÔ∏èFear the evil behind such vaccine. ‚õî‚ùå
0/-1	My question is, will the world be free from viruses after being vaccinated? Secondly, if this vaccine is good, why do you have to promote it, good things should not need promotion, automatically people will come together, let alone free.
1/1/1/1	My question to conspiracy believers is always: "How do you know for sure that your favorite conspiracy, isn't part of a another conspiracy to trick you into believing that conspiracy?"
0/0	My question why are healthy people suddenly dying after receiving the first shot?
1/1	My reaction is relief and joy. It appears worldwide prayers have been answered.
1/1	My reaction to those who refuse the vaccine is fine, more for the rest of us!
1/1	My reactions to vaccines were a painful pinch and feeling slightly more tired. I'd rather be a little sleepy than die of a disease from the 1916's
0/0	My reason is that we don't know what the long term side effects are
1/1	My record debating anti vaxers in 100% victory. Their arguments make no sense and they know it.
0/0/0	My reluctant in getting the jab simply because half the country vaccinated within a year of this pandemic starting so its definitely a no goer for me I still feel not a lot of research carried out and possible side effects later in life
1/0	My response to all discrediting the AZ vaccine: follow the money!
0/1	My right to freedom is that you should not get close to me if you're unvaccinated
0/-1	My risk of getting COVID-19 is low
1/-1	My second jab is coming up and I was sick and tired of not being able to find reassurance. It's like the entire Internet is full of conspiracy theorists, it drove me anxious and insane. Thanks for your inputs
1/1	My sibling is anti-vax/republican etc. They tried to bully my 80 year old mom into not getting the vaccine. My mom, always silently defiant, just went out and got it anyway.
1/0	My side effects from vaccines is that I‚Äôm alive and doing well.
0/0	My sister became magnetic after the vaccine. I would never take the vaccine!
0/0	My sister got sicker and most women have gotten blood clots because of these dangerous vaccines.
1/1/1	My sister had a reaction to a vaccine and can't get certain ones. She's still pro-vaccine.
0/0	My sister in law was 7 months pregnant and got Covid. Baby is healthy and she is still not vaccinated. Long term they don‚Äôt know the effects of the vaccine so they chose not to get vaccinated.
0/0	My sister is a nurse and one of my friends AND they will NOT take this vaccine! Me neither!!!!!
0/0	My sister knows two people in a nursing home that died an hour after taking the jab...........
0/0/0/0	My sister took the vaccine and she feels like she is going to die from the endless side effect that it contains and the amount that she experienced since getting vaccinated. She has already fainted and felt nausea a day after she took the vaccine.
0/0/0	My sister was deathly ill after receiving her 2nd shot, which is why Ive decided to hold off.
1/0	My sister was fully vaccinated, she‚Äôs just recovering from covid, I truly believe she would‚Äôve been hospitalised if it wasn‚Äôt for the vaccine!
1/1	My sister works in a hospital which is completely overwhelmed by all the patients with COVID. \\nThere are ZERO patients there because of bad reactions to the vaccine.
0/0	My sister-in-laws friend young in her 40‚Äôs received the vaccine. She went to the Doctor complaining that she wasn‚Äôt feeling well was having chest pain. They told her nothing was wrong with her. A week in a half after receiving the vaccine she died of a blood clot in her lung
0/0	My skin is the red line in the sand. Attempt to cross it at your own peril
1/1	My sleeve is rolled up.
1	My son & I are receiving our 2nd vaccine today!
1/1	My son and his 2 friends caught covid over Thanksgiving 2020. Thank God they are ok today. I was scared of the vaccines but I am more afraid of getting this deadly disease. I just got my covid vaccine. Stay safe all please get vaccinated.
0/0	My son developed autistic symptoms after receiving his 3rd grade vaccines. He was a happy child before that. Now he is non social and non communicative. Fortunately it's mild so he can function but I'm disgusted with people who hide and deny that this is happening. It's common sense that you don't inject chemicals into your body. Have you read the ingredient list in vaccines?
0/0/0/0	My son got the measles from MMR vaccine üíâ. My family got the flu from the free flu shot üíâ. And we will not be submitted to this evil.
0/0	My son got the measles from MMR vaccine. My family got the flu from the free flu shot. And we will not be submitted to this evil.
0/0	My son had his 2nd Oxford tonight for work he‚Äôs 23 this is frightening me üòû
0/0	My son had lot of problems after a vaccine 10 years ago
1/1	My son has primary immune deficiency and is in the same boat. His health is very dependent on the health of people around him. Get the vaccine. For everyone‚Äôs sake.
1/1	My son is 11 years old . He will be 12 soon . I will feel so much better once he's vaccinated!
1/1	My son is 6 and I was initially nervous about vaccinating him, but I ended up doing it due to reading some epidemiologists‚Äô papers on the trials. I was deeply anxious after each shot, but felt like this was the right choice for him personally and for the community.
0/0	My son is vaccinated and still ended up very sick after getting Covid-19 he was out of school for over a week and scared all of us what is the point if people are still getting very sick
0/0	My son started acting gay all of the sudden a few weeks ago.. He took the vaccine a few days before, and now he's all acting weird..
1/1	My son started his vaccine series 2 days ago. I am happy to report he has had zero side effects. The hub goes in today to start his. I'm feeling so grateful. My heart is full.
0/0	My son was completely vaxxed and he got Covid. So not sure how vaccination is supposed to stop anything.
0/0	My son-in-law said he was reluctant to get vaccinated as he thought something like cancer in 10 years was a possibility and he is university educated.
0/0	My sons birthday this weekend. When asked what he wanted he said he only wished for two gifts. His father back from heaven and the government to stop vaccines. I couldn't give him either. Some days you just want to flip the bird to the world.
0/0/0/0	My son‚Äôs girlfriend got her second Moderna vaccine today and she‚Äôs sick with a fever... she feels like she has Covid again.
1/1	My spouse being an antivaxxer would be a dealbreaker for me & I would literally divorce someone if they got this entrenched in antivax conspiracy theories.
1/1	My state has started allowing pregnant people and people with qualifying medical conditions to start signing up so I just completed the form to request an appointment tonight! It might be a bit before I actually get my vaccine but I'm excited to be a step closer!
1/1	My step mother is on a ventilator right now and probably gonna die. Un vaxxed and 62. Just a tragedy
1/1	My step son is 47 & unvaccinated. He is on a vent now & he is so ill they've started him on ECMO. He has 21 days to improve or he will be moved to comfort care, which means he will die. His family is beyond heartbroken & he is in a coma & has no idea what will happen to him. He has no say. He has 3 kids, the youngest is 4. I wouldn't wish this on anyone. The hospital hasn't lost 1 person who was vaccinated. Let that sink in.
1/1	My suggestion is get vaccinated from any of this brand if u get a chance. All are good dont wait for particular brand availability.
0/0	My sweet aunt was found dead in her driveway by my uncle almost 24 hours after getting the vaccine. What a horrifying thing to come home to after a long day of work. My family is devastated. She was 53 years old. Rest In Peace aunt Andrea.
1/1	My take the whole time has been get whatever is available first. You can always go back later for a booster of something else when more choices become available.
0/0	My thought would be, all things considered (and there would be a lot of factors to consider), would it be wiser to forgo the vaccine, at least for most people, and face a possibility of a flu-like infection and the subsequent immunity gained from it.
0/0/0/-1	My trust issues said no
0/0	My trust issues said no üëçüèª
1/1	My uncle died from covid, please send prayers our way. Please get vaccinated Edit: He was not vaccinated, my grandpa also died from it and was not vaccinated. On the other hand my gramdma was the only one vaccinated in their house and she suffered a bit of the sniffles and got better in days. Get vaccinated!! 39
1/1	My uncle has had open heart surgeries twice and he has taken two doses of vaccine. Touchwood, he is fine. Many of our neighbors who are well over 60 have completed both their vaccines. So please don't panic and go for it. Sadly, the pandemic is here to stay for a long time :(
0/0	My uncle took the Moderna shot on Friday March 12. He started feeling bad within 30 minutes. He died within 4 hours. Funeral was Monday, March 25. Data, data, data; he was a real person, not a statistic. Be careful what you put in your body. No happy ending in my uncle's story. His name was Gordon

0/0	My understanding is that you have maybe a 2% or less chance of dying from it if you catch it, which means around 98% survival rate. So help me somebody, or isn't just taking your chances around 10% better than the vaccines? Maybe my brains is not working fast enough, not sure.
1/1	My unvaccinated cousin has COVID again. He blames double vaccinated and boosted people like me for his problems. He is in the hospital but is expected to make it. Maybe his natural immunity will kick in now, because I'm not sure he would survive a round three.
1/1	My vaccin on the 20th april
0/0	My vaccine is the power blood of Jesus. Amen Hallelujah
1/1	My vaccines been working pretty fucking well enjoy natural selection
1	My very good friend died yesterday he was 48yo a care worker and leaves a wife who is a nurse and a wonderful daughter behind. Please please take the vaccine when available.
1/1/1/1	My vote is for the mRNA vaccine.
1/1	My want to work at Pfizer now
0/-1	My whole family don't use vaccine until it's been used and successful in short my fam doesn't want to take vaccines that are literally just made
1/1	My whole family got it and we are safe and free to get together and have dinners in each other‚Äôs homes. Go get the vaccine. Be an example for them
0/0	My whole family has now been vaccinated except me and my two young kids. They ask me why I‚Äôm not getting vaccinated? So many answers to give but at the end of day in today‚Äôs fake world with fake celebrities, fake news, fake politicians I trust myself and God first. #NoVaccine
1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1	My whole family has taken the vaccine and we are all fine. It was worth it for us because we saw what happened to family and friend that got CV19.
1/1	My whole family has taken the vaccine and we are all fine. It was worth it for us because we saw what happened to family and friend that got CV19.,
1/1	My wife & I got our Covid-19 vaccine today! No negative reaction at all.
0/1	My wife and I are both completely non vaxed and we both currently have Omicron. Yeah our symptoms have been bad and we were extremely sick for a few days but are now slowly recovering. Who knows how bad we would be right now if we were vaccinated..
1/1	My wife and I are both triple vaxxed. We got covid 2 weeks ago, a milder case. Recovering now. I'm sure it would have been a lot worse without the shots.
1/1	My wife and I both got the Pfizer shot. Minor soreness at the injection site and she was a little achy for about a day. Can't wait to spend time with vaccinated friends and family again!
1/1/1	My wife and I get our first on 3/31, my dad gets his first on 4/1, and my mom gets her second on 4/7 - all much sooner than I was expecting. Last November, I figured I wouldn't have a shot in my arm until the summer at the earliest, and now I'll be fully vaccinated (and near peak levels of protection) by the end of April. The process hasn't been perfect, but we're collectively killing it from a distribution standpoint. I can't wait until things go back to normal.
1/1	My wife and I got our 1st Moderna vaccination today, January 20, 2021.
1/1	My wife and I got our first shot Tuesday. It was such a relief.

1/1	My wife and I will be receiving the 2nd Moderna vaccine on the 15th, can‚Äôt wait
1/1	My wife gets hers tomorrow and I get mine the day after. üòä
1/1	My wife got covid pneumonia on December 27th. She was sick for 29 days and still hasn't 100% recovered. Of course, she refused the vaccine. But after being sick for a month, she said, "I learned my lesson."
1/1	My wife got hers, she is fine. Been couple weeks now. Every person is bound to have many different reactions to any of the vaccines. I got my second Moderna today and no symptoms from 1st and none from second so far.
1/1	My wife got the Moderna vaccine 3 weeks ago and worst she had was a slightly sore arm for 2 days.
1/1	My wife got the vaccine today - she's a doctor in Birmingham, UK and the second person to get it in the area. She's volunteered to help administer and monitor people receiving the vaccine. Super proud of her.
0/0	My wife had her 1st dose yesterday. This morning she collapsed. GP said take her to A&E. She says she feels weak & headache. I don't know which vaccine she's had as its not written on card just her name & DOB! WTF? I'm beside myself.
1/1	My wife had the vaccine just over a week ago and she's been mostly fine. I mean apart from the fact that she's put pain to our Veganary by her lust for human brains √∞≈∏¬ß≈∏. (I joke of cause√∞≈∏Àú‚Äö)
1/1	My wife is 6 months pregnant and we've already gotten the fetus 2 shots and 5 boosters. She's still not fully protected though..
1/1	My wife is a doctor , 31 y/o and had both pfizer. She felt tired and had some stomachache for two days after the shots , nothing more
1/1	My wife is getting her second dose of the Moderna vaccine this Wednesday! I only hope that I too can get vaccinated shortly!
1/1	My wife is in healthcare transporting covid positive patients every day. She comes home and is so exhausted. We are both so excited to know that this is on the horizon and know it's coming soon
0/0	My wife is pregnant, I don't want to let them vaccine my child, how should I proceed? Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.
0/0	My wife just got off the phone with her mum. Her mum spoke to a parent whose boys attend the same school as ours. His youngest is a national level athelete who now can't run for two years after heart complications post Covid vaccination. Stop the vaccine rollout for kids!
0/0	My wife just told me two elderly residents at the nursing home that she works for have just died after getting the shot.
1/1	My wife was one of them as a healthcare worker. She said it didn‚Äôt hurt at all and she still feels fine.
1/1	My wife who is allergic to near everything had little to no reaction on her second shot. First shot gave us both the munchies. I had no issues with my second shot. So dont freak yourselves out till you actually get symptoms. Ps, we are both 71.
1/1	My wife, Lee-Ann, got Covid around the time the vaccination window for her age group opened - so she wasn‚Äôt vaccinated. She died. She is gone. Life for my sons and I, her family, will never be same. If it can spare any other family the same loss & pain - please get vaccinated.
1/1	My work sent an email today saying they were stopping the j&j and were only giving moderna. we were able to vaccinate so many people because of j&j. This is going to be a huge setback
1/1	My worst nightmare when I was pregnant was getting covid and having to be separated from my baby after birth. I isolated completely for over a month before delivery and got vaccinated as soon as I could. HOW could you not do that if there is a risk of you not holding your newborn baby in your arms??? It‚Äôs truly mind boggling.
0/0	My younger sister is a doctor and asked me if I wanted to get vaccinated for covid BS and I freaked out and told her NO. Her reaction was priceless.
0/0	My younger sister who is in her 40‚Äôs had blood clot debris in her blood, then had sizers after she got the Pfizer vaccine. She‚Äôs still having pulmonary hypertension symptoms & now is on a heart monitor for a month. I‚Äôm on blood thinner after a massive PE following a broken ankle surgery the 2nd PE in the last 13 yrs & was told not to get the vaccine then told that it was ok to get the vaccine. Same dr. I‚Äôm so scared to get it. Either way I feel like I‚Äôm dammed if I do & dammed if I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm worried for my sister.
0/0	My youngest son became autistic after having the MMR vaccine. They are full of it
1/1	Myocarditis is more common from getting Covid than from the vaccine. Including in children. So I don‚Äôt follow. Seems like the risk of the vaccine is lower than the risk of getting Covid
1/1/1	Myself and my daughters all had Pfizer. My 17 year old had her first vaccine yesterday. They all wanted it and asked me to make them appointments. I was happy to.
1/1	Myself and my kiddos have been fully vaccinated and so far have yet to catch covid or any varints. Thank you God!
1/1	Myself, I am entusiastic about the vaccin and will definitely take it. I want to be able to visit my grandchildren in England. I am also thankful that the British will lead and test the vaccin on the elderly in care homes in massive roll-out. This way, the rest of Europe will know if it is safe for the very old and vulnerable when we start our campaigns a month from now. Thank you!

Get the shot if you feel comfortable with it and are knowing acknowledging the possible risks, but do not tell other to get it or not and never claim it is safe when even the scientist won't say that without using words like maybe, could be, possibly, 'no evidence' that being a KEY word right now as Pregnant and young people have only been getting this shot for less than a year.

1/-1	National lockdown or vaccine. Choose one
0/0	Natural immunity all the way
0/0	Natural immunity always worked and always will, no need for useful ineffective vaccines and every single doctor knows this.
0/0	Natural immunity has always been better than a chemical. A vaccine should have only been offered to the vulnerable and those with no immune system support. Otherwise, these companies and our government just shutdown a lot of people's immune systems by forcing them into a mask.

0	Natural immunity is nearly as successful and thousands of times safer for the individual.
0/0	Natural immunity is still the best
0/0	Natural immunity is the only real kind of immunity. All other forms of induced immunity, are artificial attempts to cheat nature. Personally, I opted out of participating in these experiments back in January 2020, and I won't be changing my mind.
0/0	Natural immunity is working. Vaccines are helpful but natural immunity is much better.
0/0	Natural immunity over artificial, plain and simple. Let‚Äôs not forget 99%+ survival rate

1/1/1	Never have I seen such selfishness (and sheer stupidity) than I have in this last year. If you don't want the vaccine, fine. Move on with your life. Rather than jumping on the Internet to talk crap purely to frighten already scared ppl. If you think your immune system is just fine alone.. Great! Good for you! But maybe, just maybe, you could spare a second thought for those that don't! Those that have heart or lung conditions, the elderly, those that cannot afford to test their immune system against something that could prove to be deadly! You could get it, not know it and pass it on to someone who could die from it.. But at least you did OK, right...? Ffs.. I'm utterly sick of seeing ppl say "I'm alright" or ‚Äúit's just the flu‚Äú and try and ram down your throat the survival rates and statistics... (and I'd love to see that argument fly with those who have lost a loved one to Covid) . Of course ppl wouldn't contemplate a rushed vaccine. But their alternative probably isn't much better either!! Certainly not when half the population are selfish twats - its highly unlikely we can resolve this mess relying on those sorts of ppl either!

0/-1	Next day today show is canceled the whole crew is having severe side effects
1/1	Next up is twice as many vaccinated as cases. Let's hope to hit that by the end of the month. And that rate of new cases just keeps plummeting, largely thanks to the vaccines, while the rate of vaccine doses given has been increasing in that same time. In the first week of January, there was an average of 260,000 new cases and 500,000 vaccine doses given every day. At the end of January, it was an average of 150,000 new cases and 1,300,000 vaccine doses given every day. It's kind of hard to overstate what a dramatic turn around last month was for the state of the virus in the United States. We went from the absolute worst of it to a precipitous decline that isn't showing any signs of letting up. We're a lot closer to the end than a lot of people are saying. This is very, very exciting.
0/-1	Next video idea: "Inside the lab that made Covid-19!"

1/1	Nice video! Thanks for informing us in a logic way without prejudice... Vaccination is a serious issue and we should all be responsible and do it!
1/-1	Nice video, however you didn't mention arguably best adenovirus vaccine - Sputnik V (Lancet already showed that it has better efficiency than JJ and Astra and can be compared with Pfizer and Moderna ). And they use a different platform to overcome a drawback that you mentioned.
1/1	Nice, happy to see the UK have a good vaccine rollout after the subpar management. Now let's get the rest of the world to the same place.
1/1	Nice, something good came out of it after all. If this technique works as good as they claim it will, then this is truly amazing. What a time to be alive.
0/0	Nice. You just changed your DNA mixed with RNA and other stuff we don't know. Atleast some people just... caught it and became immune or got their Blood type tested to see that they were immune to it. Taking that Vaccine without knowing the true side effect is not something to jump at. But to each their own
0/0	Nicely explained. This has helped me to decide against getting vaccinated for now. Thank you.
1/1	Nine months after I was a guinea pig for Oxford's coronavirus vaccine, I'm quite emotional that my parents are getting it on Tuesday. Last May, we knew nothing about it for sure. Now, we know it's safe, it's effective and it reduces transmission. I'm in awe of the scientists
0/0	No !!! We do not need to continue to take boosters and perpetuate this insanity.
0/0	No , definitely NO . Not been tested enough .
0/0	No - you simply can‚Äôt ‚Äútrust‚Äù that the COVID-19 vaccine is safe.I have had problems with vaccines before, from spending a few days in bed after flu shots to spending 4 months at home with a ‚Äòkidney infection‚Äô and paralysis after the polio vaccine in 1963. At least 10% of the polio vaccine was contaminated with SV40, a kidney virus. The vaccine is a ‚Äònovel‚Äô vaccine to a ‚Äònovel‚Äô virus that has been rushed to market. Respected scientists and doctors have expressed concerns over both the vaccine test design and the possible manipulation of test data. We have no long term data re safety or durability of the vaccine. The short term data is revealing an alarming number and array of symptoms and deaths that are being dismissed as coincidental. Dividing adverse effect into types for each vaccine and say each type is rare for that vaccine is a ploy. Moreover, ‚Äúrare‚Äù is a subjective term that is meaningless if it affect you or yours. Pontificating the the ‚Äòbenefit is worth the risk‚Äô is an immoral dictate that ignores the risk to individuals in different demographics. The emergency use authorization (EUA) means the FDA does not do quality control inspections of manufacturing. Vaccine manufacturers have made millions of vials of their product which is ready to ship without having FDA approval or vetted data while the media pounds on the drums to rush this along. This is marketing, not medical science
0/0/0/0	No Because it is a brand new vaccine, and needs at least 4-10 years to prove it is safe. This one has been rushed out too soon, period end of story.
0/-1	No Bill Gates microchips for me, thank you
0/0	No Confidence. Absolutely none
1/1/1/1	No Excuses...! NO FEAR...!NO RUMOURS...! YES TO COVID VACCINE...!Just take your vaccine when You will get chance or receive notification by govt. authority
0/0	No Government of any country can force its citizen to take vaccine. I and all in my family are not taking any vaccine.
0/0	No I do not want an unlicensed fully tested vaccine where the government has suspended liability so that they not the manufacturers can be sued.
1/1	No I don‚Äôt believe they went along not to get fired. I am sure I am not the only person to not only loose friends, but family too. Some of your are in a cult that is proven to be deadly in many ways to our country. Our country wasn‚Äôt founded on just your rights, we the people, is ALL people. So quit looking at this as a problem you can escape from any responsibility. Because wether or not you know it your lies have killed people. We are all in this fight together, well when y‚Äôall have had enough of death, maybe you will join the fight to keep this airborn virus from having a host to mutate in.
0/0	No I will not be getting the vaccine. We have no idea what the lasting effect will be, I have a family member that had covid 19 and she is sick all the time now, she is in and out of hospital because of it and they tell her they don't know how to help her other then antinflamatorys , antibiotics or pain medications!
0/0	No I will not because 55 People Have Died in US After Receiving COVID-19 Vaccines
0/0/0/0	No I won't get vaccinated. I‚Äôll wait for everyone else and their families to be the guinea pigs and figure out what horrible, long-term diseases result from this rushed out band-aid

0/0	No I wouldn't take it I want to live
0/0	No I wouldn‚Äôt trust any vaccine. As I know who owns Big Pharma and funds them.
0/0	No I'm not Getting Vaccine.I Dont Know what they put inside that its Not Safe
0/0	No I'm not getting it. Doesn't actually prevent you from getting it, it's only good temporarily, I've worked retail through the entire pandemic, never got it, and I've only had one flu shot in like 10 years. I think I'll be ok.

0/0	No Vax.. Not for 5 years or so..\nyou can do your own experiments.,
0/0/0	No Virus No deaths Just lies Don't have the vaccine
1/1	No amount of articles or common sense will change the average anti vaxxers mind. They've already decided vaccines are evil and are almost guaranteed to be too stubborn to sway their mind.
1/1	No amount of data or proof will be enough for the antivax idiots. They are willing to die for what they believe in. And it honestly doesn‚Äôt bother me one bit.
1/1	No amount of evidence will ever persuade an idiot
0/0	No amount of fear mongering, manipulation or intimidation will ever make me take this vaccine. I feel like I fully understand how bad it could damage me but I'm willing to take that risk to subvert from taking any vaccine. Something has been well off right from the start and I feel its all to do with China. I may not have all the facts, and I know I never will, but my gut is telling me not to take it, no matter what. It is no more or no less believable that this virus originating from a wet market in Wuhan than it is being released by the CCP deliberately, starting Bio warfare on a global scale. Most people will natural choose to believe what mainstream media has told them from the knowledge they got from a CCP bought WHO. I can't do that. I also find the fact the Chinese people very very conveniently are the LEAST effected by this virus.
1/1	No antivaxxer should have the right to work in healthcare. Period.
0/0	No because everytime I did a vaccine i got the flu and I'm very young and it's better that people who works in the hospital and who really needs it does it before me.
0/0	No because personally I believe they could try and inject people with something that could kill them or just anything. Plus you could end up getting the COVID just like how you catch the flu from getting a flu shot.
0/0	No because there is no such thing as Covid-19
0/0	No because vaccines per a study done by yale in 2017 were found to be associated with mental disorders. They postulate that the same immune cells you create to fight the disease also attack healthy cells.This virus only kills a fraction of a percent of people.
0/0	No body can believa a word this organisation says. These vaccines are only experimental and that makes them extremely unsafe to the point of being poisonous. We cannot sue the pharmaceutical company if something goes wrong so there must be something very wrong with them

Remember, ending this pandemic is one of the humanitys great race, whether we like it or not, we will win or lose together.
0/0	No covid 19 vaccines its not safe its not protecting its killing people. Only GOD can protect us nothing else
0/0	No cure for diabetes but no time we have one for China virus
0/0	No cuz I'm healthy and I'm 16 so the chances of me needing to get hospitalised from covid I extremely small if I got covid. You can never be sure if a new vaccine will have bad long term effects.

1/1	No ifs, ands or buts. üíâ GO GET YOUR JAB! üíâ
0/0	No it bloody well should not!! Nobody should b forced to have long-term outcome unknown, so-called vaccine injected into their body against their will in order to go about their business. How soon the lessons of WW2 & Mengele are forgotten. We must be free to choose. Tests only
0/0	No it does not discriminate. 1 shot , 2 shots , 3 shots, 4 shots or none. Are all getting it. So when does the 5th came out
0/0	No it doesn‚Äôt. The vaccine doesn‚Äôt keep you from getting COVID. Where are you getting your facts? Facebook?
0/0	No it isn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt care what mandates are made, anyone trying to force anything on me is getting smoked.
1/0	No it's common sense, why would i get a largely untested vaccine for something that has an over 99% survival rate for? I already had the virus and it was the mildest flu symptoms i ever had , and I'm immune now
1/1	No it‚Äôs not. It makes overwhelming sense to get vaccinated. You obviously know nothing about it.

1/1	No logical reason not to.
0/0	No long term data on anything regarding any of the vaccines - period. They have no idea if it will affect unborn children even.
0/0	No long term data... seems risky.
0/0	No long term studies. End of story
0/0/0/0	No manufacturer LIABILITY NO KNOWLEDGE OF LONG TERM EFFECTS Doctors can be taught lies and paid to say vcine is fine, but THOUSANDS of other health professionals have spoken against vcine with their livelihoods and reputation AT STAKE.
0/0	No manufacturer liability, NO trust. If the vaccine makers don't believe in the safety of their product enough to stand by it, why should we?
0/0	No mask or vaccine for me.
0/0	No mask, no vaccine, alive and feeling fine.
0/0	No mask, no vaccines, or no lockdowns for me not doing none of it
1/1	No matter how you split the data the vaccine is effective
1/1	No matter what they say the antivaxiners..Im going to do the vaccine! ..I trust science and medicine more than them!!!!....
1/-1/1	No matter what vaccine you get , we have to see when this corona virus will stop its rapid mutation , if that not happening be prepared for yearly vaccination
0/-1	No matter what you may think of vaccines in general, it's very creepy how hard they're selling this. Best we can do is our best to inform ourselves from as legit sources as possible. Best to all.
0/-1	No matter where you heard that claim about the COVID-19 vaccines, it might be making you wary of getting vaccinated when it‚Äôs your turn.
0/0	No mention of the fact that Moderna and others won't have any liability if the covid vaccine isn't safe and effective? No mention that it is essentially experimental? It takes years to develop vaccines. Now, all of a sudden it's important to make every American a guinea pig for Big Pharma?
0/0	No more "Booster" shots for me! No Mas.
1/1	No more excuses get vaccinated!!
0/0	No more experimental drugs

1/1	No negative effects please get vaccinated. I'll be first in line to get a jab.
0/0	No news is coming out that makes me doubt that I made the correct choice by not taking the woke poke. I have a suspicion that even more bad news about it is on the horizon.
0	No no no no now I am not getting that damn jab
0/0	No no no something is not right with this covid vaccine omg don't take it.
0/0	No no no. Just wait untill you got your second vaccine and than after few years than make a video..
0/0	No not yet, it's too soon to tell if this vaccine works or if it's even safe.Even if it is proven safe and effective I am not sure I will get one,, I think each person should decide for themselves if they need it or not.
0/0	No number of vaccines and boosters stops you catching Covid and passing it on.
0/0	No offense, but my immune system has been doing pretty good for over a half a century. I‚Äôm gonna stick with it, thank you very much, though. I heard a rumor a while back about ‚Äòmy body, my choice.‚Äô. I heard another rumor as well. It‚Äôs called the #2ndAmendment m#%ther f#%cker!
0/0	No one believes the vaccine will work well
0/0	No one can force an experimental drug into any one's body without their full consent according to the Nuremberg Code. But the US Constitution does have a provision to disband a government that no longer serves the people, and all States have the right to secede from the Union. We are a legal federation of individual states.
0/-1	No one creates a disease without creating a cure at the same time
1/1	No one has EVER said that if you are vaxxed and boosted you could not get the viruses. That is not the point. The point is you will not be hospitalized or die!!
0/0	No one has any idea of the long term effects.. This is still in emergency trial stage.. not approved by the FDA.. yet is being forced on us!! We turn our TVs on everyday with medications being recalled and lawsuits on the manufactures.. but yet again this is still being forced on us.. when we know the long term effects.. then this can be a requirement.. not until! If you want it.. go for it... if not.. it‚Äôs ok also! This should be a personal choice!
1/1	No one has died from the vaccine while many people have died from covid
0/0	No one has had the vaccine in their body for more than eight months (as of late December 2020), so the honest answer is we don‚Äôt know yet if these vaccines cause long-term problems
0/0	No one in our large extended family would take the experimental shot for a million dollars and we think money is nice.
1/0	No one in their right mind would let someone stick them with this rushed vaccine. Scientists tested these vaccines properly for saving human lives. Some filty people are spreading negative comments and influencing other people
1/1	No one is forcing anyone to get a vaccine. But you should lol
0/0	No one is getting the proper medical care during this vaccine push. They just care about sticking a needle in people and pretending they are fixing a problem.
0/0	No one is going to force me to take it.
1/0	No one is really sure whether or not the vaccines provide sterilizing immunity yet.
0	No one is ‚Äúanti vaccine‚Äù, they are just concerned about a rushed ‚Äúunproven‚Äù vaccine.
0/0	No one knows because it is a biologically engineered viral weapon. Boost your own immunity
0/-1	No one knows the long term consequences of getting the vaccine
1/0	No one knows the long term effects of altering carrier dna. It's not just that its new...it's that no one can predict what the long term effects will be. And not just for our generation.
0/0	No one needs the COVID booster, as long as they stay healthy.
0	No one needs the vaccine, but all these sheep want it like it's going to help them. Ha! You know what does help? Not being obese and old :D
0/0	No one needs these injections called "vaccines". Gov't parties have proved that the whole pandemic was a hoax from the start
0/0	No one on this earth can make me have this experimental jab. No way!
1/1	No one said vaccines were totally safe, but, they did say that you have a significantly increased chance of survival just by getting them.
0/0	No one should be taking these ‚Äúcocktails‚Äù that are statistically the deadliest and most injurious than all other medication over the past 30 years combined. Far safer and more effective treatments are available if necessary, the vast majority recover fine with nothing at all.
0/0	No one should be tracked or forced into vaccines. The governments already starting to control us. There making us wear masks, making us stop working, making us social distance. The governments controlling our lives and it‚Äôs crazy!
0/0	No one should have a medical intervention to benefit others, the ethics of which are highly questionable, and if the intervention is experimental, it is against the Nuremburg code, UNESCO Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights
0/0	No one should support the governments attemt to inject us with some untested crap!
0/0/0	No one should take the vaccine.
0/-1	No one should try to make people loose their job/career not putting chemicals in their body
0/0	No one sticking that poison in my arm

0/0	No one will be experimenting on me or my family
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	No one will be experimenting on me or my family, take it to the bank.
0/0	No one will ever convince me enough to take that killler vaccine.
0/0	No one with a brain would take a 'vaccination' developed for a virus (weapon) that appeared a year ago. I'm going to wait and see what happens.
0	No pandemic, no vaccine !!!
1/1	No photo, but Ken and I were vaccinated Saturday (Pfizer) at the local cottage hospital. Perfect organisation, no side effects apart from a bit of a sore arm late in the day. All gone now. Go get it if you can!
0/0	No plans on getting a vaccine. Latest I saw IFR was around 0.15%, and flu is 0.1%, so it's only a little worse than flu.
1/-1	No point in dying now....my sentiments exactly
0/-1	No point risking it. 99.90% of people will survive without the vaccine and the high riskers can get it and do their thing.
0/0	No poison for me. Respect for protestors
0/0	No preventing this natural part of evolution people . Let it run it course for crying out loud .
1/1	No problems with the vaccine just like getting the flu jab
0/0	No proof covid exist at all, nor did the vax manufacturers have the virus. Nothing to do with a virus in that concoction.
0/0	No proof that the vax@actually makes Covid less risky‚Ä¶repeating the lie doesn‚Äôt make it true. Who‚Äôs paying to say these things‚Ä¶certainly not the Frontline Doctors. A real, honest and brave doctor would prescribe IVERMECTIN!!
0/0	No questions, just don`t do it! With survival chances better then 99.8%, it makes way more sense than an unproven vaccine!
0/0/0/-1	No scientific proof' really means there's no money in the answer so we're not paying for the research
0/0	No serious effects? Tell that to Hank Aaron.... oh wait... he's dead 2 days after taking the vaccine
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	No serious effects? Tell that to Hank Aaron.... oh wait... he's dead 2 days after taking the vaccine.
1/1	No serious safety events relating to the vaccine were observed during Phase 3 trials, with the shot ‚Äúwell tolerated‚Äù across different dosing regimens
1/1	No shaming of others. Excellent stuff. I thought I was at risk due to medication allergies but after speaking to my doctor, she recommended the COVID-19 vaccine. I got the Moderna one and fully vaccinated since March. I didn't have any major side effects and I'm still doing fine
0/0	No shot for me!
0/0	No side affects at all if I choose not to get vaccinated. Never had a flu shot before and never will! 99+% survival rate.....hope people can soon get that!

0/0	No thank you. I'll just eat healthy.

0/0	No thanks I choose not to take the vaccine I just simply don't trust it yet I'll give it another year or two of testing and I will go from there

0/0	No thanks! Experimental therapies by vaccine are not my bag!
0/0	No thanks! I don‚Äôt get flu vaccines and I will not be getting this one either. The majority of people I know are not interested in this vaccine. The general reaction is why would I get a vaccine for something that has a less than 1% fatality fate.
0/0	No thanks! I will not be vaccinated against an illness that kills less than half of a percent of the population.

0/0	No thanks, you take it.
0/0	No thanks,, I‚Äôll stick with the body immune system. But it would be interesting to see you make a video explaining how to effectively disable and shut down this covid19 vaccine once in the body. No ones done that yet, everyone‚Äôs promoting taking the cv19 vaccine, it‚Äôs all one sided. Somethings very wrong about all this.
0/0	No thanks. I dont want to develop Unknown illnesses

0/-1	No vaccine is 100 percent is effective
0/1	No vaccine is never 100% safe. The question is, are you willing to be a victim? If you do become a victim, you can not sue the pharmaceutical companies.
1/1	No vaccine is perfect or risk-free. But not being vaccinated with an FDA-approved vaccine is irresponsible and foolish. I don't know what my district plans with staff and student vaccinations. But I will be getting vaccinated as soon as it is available for me. For my own personal health & safety, and for that of my students and the community.
1/1	No vaccine is perfect. No COVID vaccine will be perfect. But vaccines are our best option. You need to consider if you trust your government and health care service that approve and supply vaccines. If you have concerns about allergic reactions then try to get vaccinated in a hospital where they can easily treat allergic reactions. There is no guarantee with vaccines. Everyone responds differently to vaccines. I trust that my government has made a good decision in approving a COVID 19 vaccine. But I do not know how reliable your government is.
0/0	No vaccine is safe. A vaccine in under a year is a joke
0/0	No vaccine keeps you from getting covid and no vaccine cures you of it.

0/0	No vaccine will be needed.
1/-1	No vaccine works 100%. That's why everyone needs to get it. If it worked 100% then we could stop giving it like we did for smallpox once that worked to eradicate the disease. And even that vaccine didn't work 100%. You still got the disease and you were still infectious.

0/0	No vaccine.. My body, my choice.

I like to live life the way I want..if I don't want to eat a food or take an imjection...I just won't. 5. I don't trust anything they push so much.
0/0	No way would I take this.
0/0	No way! So many people are DEAD after the vaccine or injured really seriously.
0/0	No way, i will only take it after 2 years. It is a rush job.
0/0	No way, i will only take it after 2 years. It is a rush job....
0/0/0	No way, i will only take it after 2 years. It is a rush job.....
0/0	No way, not even if they try take my job and freedom I still won‚Äôt let them put that crap in me
0/0	No way. It‚Äôs experimental. The MRNA vax that has never been tried before in humans has killed animals it was tested on. Covid is survivable. There are medicines that cure covid if you start them soon enough. I have a strong immune system. There is no way anyone should get this vax unless they are old. Ask yourself‚Äî why is the govt pushing it so hard. Do you think seriously they have YOUR best interest at heart? Do some research. And not via google. You may be surprised at the science you will find regarding the virus and the vaccine
0/0	No way. We have had Covid recently without "vaccinations" and we all recovered within two days. Keep the poison for those who care.
0/0	No we don't need them.
0/0	No we just don't want the endless side effects a rushed through vaccine could give us.
1/1	No wonder goods and services are taking too long to receive. Just get the damn shot and get back to work or lose your job! Sure it's your freedom, but i'm sure other people who would love to take your jobs!
0	No you don‚Äôt need to know long term ! Just take a look at short term for yourself and you will say no to start with, then no having to consider long term.
0/0	No you shouldn‚Äôt take it. Coronavirus is fake and doesn‚Äôt exist so that means the vaccine is to make people sterile, or it‚Äôs a lethal injection, or it‚Äôs an rfid chip. But it‚Äôs not any kind of cure. People better use their brains
1/1	No you‚Äôre looking at it the wrong way. Why don‚Äôt you try to find evidence that they are harmful to begin with? There is no reputable scientific document that calls into question the importance and safety of vaccines. The only issue lies in that if you have allergic reactions to it or something from issues with your immune system. The one article where all this started has been redacted and the researcher himself redacting his conclusions. I‚Äôm saying this for your safety, get vaccinated
0/0	No üëémore " Booster " shots for me ! No Mas.
0/0	No üíâ injection for me nor my family (we must call it injection, because is not a vaccine, open your eyes üëÄ
0/0	No!
0/0	No! I am not so sure it works,l saw and see many complications from vaccines.
0/0	No! I will pass
0/0/0/0	No! No long term studies! Also, not like other vaccines at all, brand new technology! So many adverse affects and reports of death after vaccination. Long term prospects look even worse.
0/-1	No! Not necessary to vaccinate young kids.
0/0	No!! I dont really understand, why you need to be vaccinated if you have strong immune system? We dont know yet the side effects in a long run of that vaccines.
0/0	No, I am waiting for Andrew Cuomo‚Äôs special panel of experts to approve this. Remember, he said we couldn‚Äôt trust any vaccine that came out under the Trump administration.
0/0/0/0	No, I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs safe, too much rushing to get the product out. No long-term trials. I do not trust it. I do not trust the process.
1/0	No, I just don‚Äôt take any old shit from accounts full of hysterical vaccine-sceptical nonsense. What you‚Äôre spreading is flat out dangerous rubbish that will get people killed. You should be ashamed of yourself. Go away.
0/0	No, I personally do not need it and I do not believe in most vaccines
0/0/0/0	No, I will NOT be getting the vaccine any time soon. I do NOT trust it.
0/0	No, I won't since 55 people in the United States have died after receiving COVID-19 vaccines.
0/0/0/0	No, I'd never get the vaccine, and I'm high risk!
0/0	No, I'd never get the vaccine, eventhough I'm a risk taking person.
0/0	No, I'm not going to take it... it's like common flu..my cousin has it and she got over in few weeks.. people died because they already had other health problem.. these vaccine will kill you later..
0	No, I'm not taking it. I have seen and heard too much testimony of horror stories. I don't really trust this new class of vaccine....I'm not an anti vaxxer, but I'm going to try and get away with taking the covid vaccine as long as I can practicing best safety methods. I have a high platelet count and many people have been affected/killed by blood clots after taking the vaccine, and I am susceptible to them. The risks don't outweigh the rewards for me, personally.
0/0	No, I‚Äôll wait for everyone else and their families to be the guinea pigs and figure out what horrible, long-term diseases result from this rushed out band-aid.
0	No, I‚Äôm afraid of a vaccine that they complete in less than 6 months
0/0	No, I‚Äôm afraid of a vaccine that they complete in less than 6 months. Gee, what could go wrong?
0/0	No, because I believe that the virus really isn't a thing.
0/0	No, but the people who take the vaccines do LIE... they Lie Down permanently.
0/0	No, don‚Äôt trust that shit at all
0/0/0/0	No, for the simple reason that I'm immune.
0/0	No, for the simple reason that I'm immune. My wife caught it in Spain while we were travelling in our camper van for three months and I did not have very much reaction to the bug at all while she was quite ill for a while and we lived as closely as you can get in a tiny space.
0/0	No, in fact the opposite is true: there is NO vaccine -- mRNA or not -- that has been proven to reduce deaths from C-19. The confidence intervals for all vaccines include 0% decrease.
0/-1	No, it doesn't - not for young people or healthy people. Generally I believe that +90% had it with a high amount of ones who did not even know. From a small 2 days cough to no Symptoms or same as a cold - it has everything.
0/0	No, kids shouldn't get viccinate, is too soon to know future health concequence
1/-1	No, mRNA vaccine technologies are not new. The medical applications of potential mRNA technologies were realized soon after the discovery of mRNA
0/-1	No, no, it's got to be 99% triple vaxxed and you still have to wear a N95.
0/0	No, no, the vaccine doesn't make you safe, only the vaccine passport will be able to do that.'
0/1	No, not until the most vulnerable children are safe to be present. Not until the children with the highest rates of asthma, blood Pb levels, PFAS exposures, and other environmental injustices that dangerously exacerbate their COVID risk exposure are safe.
0/0	No, people do not have a moral responsibility to take an #experimentalvaccine and NO they aren't "so good" at protecting against death or serious illness for that matter.
0/0	No, since I do not get flu shots I will not get COVID-19 vaccination. Remarkably, I do not get sick and would like to keep that way!!
0/0	No, the government should not force individuals to take something that doesn‚Äôt have research on the long-term side effects. If they want to take that risk then let them.
1/1	No, the vaccin cannot spread the virus. The injected mRNA only encodes for the spike protein and not for all the prote√Ønes and the RNA that is needed to make a new virus.
0/1	No, there is no brainwashing going on. Everything is fine! Just take the vaccine. Just take the vaccine. Take the vaccine. Take the vaccine. The vaccine. The vaccine. Vaccine. Vaccine.
1/0	No, they contain adjuvants which may or may not consist of involatile mercury derivatives that are incapable of causing the same chronic, deleterious effects of regular, purified liquid mercury. These adjuvants typically act to elicit an inflammatory response that "jumpstarts" your adaptive immune response into creating memory B and T cells which respond to the viral (in this case) antigens that are injected through the vaccine. Later on, your body retains these memory cells and is able to mount an even more effective and rapid response that essentially prevents the pathogen from colonizing your body effectively and causing severe damage to your tissues. Additionally, a lot of the mercury-based adjuvants have been phased out in favor of modern adjuvants with more effective ways of coaxing the human inflammatory response. None of these have been shown, in the hundreds of thousands of trials tested and billions of people administered on, to contain stem cells or directly harmful ingredients. The worst case usually results in an attentuated, live strain randomly genetically reverting from a non-infectious strain to one that can actually infect and spread from its host. However, this is rare, and the current COVID-19 vaccines do not contain any viruses, just the mRNA which produces spike proteins, which are harmless on their own and rapidly degraded by the body. Hope that clears some of it up. -Microbiology PhD student. Feel free to ask more questions and I'll try to answer as best I can.
1/0	No, they take years to develop because of funding, not looking at long term effects. Once the vaccine is gone from your system, very quickly I might add, it can't cause any other effects. So stop lying.
1/1	No, they're not. These vaccines went through the exact same process that any other drug goes through. It went faster because the vaccines had top priority and were able to jump the line ahead of every other drug the FDA was evaluating. In other words, no steps in proving effectiveness or safety were skipped. These same mullets who are saying they don't trust the vaccine are the same ones that demand we "listen to the science". Oh the irony.
0/0	No, vaccines take years to make also it was rushed so
1/1	No, you are not too busy to schedule and get a vaccine. Nope, you are not. You ARE too busy to get COVID. And other people are definitely too busy to get COVID because of you. #GetVaccinated
1/1	No, you won't die. You'll probably get a little soreness where the needle goes in. 2nd dose may give you some flu like symptoms, but those goes away after a day or two. Don't listen to people trying to scare you. They aren't doctors, and are just scaring people with anecdotes!
0/0/0/0	No,I will not. The current vaccine prospects are being rushed through trials exceedingly quickly, and as such their safety will be far from proven when rolled out.
0/0	No,I‚Äôm planning on getting the disease, if I can find someone actually sick with it.
0/0	No- we are not vaccine ‚Äúhesitant‚Äù , we are saying no to a shot that doesn‚Äôt do anything to impart immunity or prevent spread of a cold.
0/0	No-one should be allowed to force another person to have a medical procedure. No-one.
0/1	No. First, because everytime I did a vaccine i got the flu, second I'm very young and it's better that people who works in the hospital and who really needs it does it before me. I really wonder why people online are always pro at vaccine and are scared to go out/judge other people that don't stay at home/take extreme measures to be safe and in real life people live as always and don't want to get the vaccine (:
0/0	No. I care about my health. I have no intention of receiving any vaccine. I remain vaccine free. I remain sickness free.
0/0	No. I don't want a vax adverse effect. I don't want a rare disorder. That's not in the interest of my safety, or best interests.
0/0/0	No. I feel like all three of the Covid vaccinations have been rushed. I want to hear about the side effects to the first people who have taken them. From the volunteers who did a trial with this, I haven‚Äôt heard anything positive
0/0	No. I feel like all three of the Covid vaccinations have been rushed. I want to hear about the side effects to the first people who have taken them. From the volunteers who did a trial with this, I haven‚Äôt heard anything positive.
0/0	No. I hate waxine. It causes autism (I'm vaccinated and not a Karen pls don't kill me)
0/0	No. I have done enough research to know that this is NOT about a fake zombie apocalypse virus.
0/1	No. I haven't had the flu in over 20 years. (I had one flu shot). I rarely get a cold. I rarely get sick. I have a very good immune system and healthy constitution. If I get Covid-19 then I get it. But until then, I'll do what I have to do to look after my body and strengthen the immune system as it hasn't let me down yet.
0/-1	No. I think vulnerable groups should have it first and I'm 67 and thin so no risk. Secondly I believe natural infection is more protective and re-exposure boosts immunity.
0/0	No. It takes 10 years to develop a vaccine as it takes 10 years of clinical trials to deem a vaccine safe.
0/0	No. It was rushed to market after only six months of testing, making it the first vaccination to be authorized in less than four years. Only because of the 'Covid emergency' was it allowed.
0/0	No. It was rushed to market with less than 6 months of testing, the only vaccine in history to be approved in less than 4 years. It was approved only because of the ‚ÄòCovid emergency‚Äô.
1/1/1	No. I‚Äôm done wearing a mask as soon as vaccines are widely available, and there‚Äôs nothing that anyone can do about it.
0/0	No. I‚Äôm healthy. It‚Äôs not necessary.The epidemiology data here in Australia shows that COVID19 presents as a mild disease, except in extremely rare cases for the elderly with chronic health conditions.
0/0	No. I‚Äôm not in a high risk group and I have serious concerns about the expedited nature in which these vaccines have been produced. We better hope like hell there aren‚Äôt any long term side effects, because while we can make educated guesses and we can ‚Äúhope‚Äù, we simply do not know in the way that we do with other vaccines that have been approved after 10 years of trialing and clinical testing. And anyone that isn‚Äôt appropriately skeptical of profit motivated legally insulated pharmaceutical companies and governments with a clear economic and political incentive to produce something that can be sold as a safe, working vaccine is far too trusting.
0	No. Many polio vaccines gave polio. Many TB vaccines gave TB. I doubt if any vaccine is more good than harm.
0/0	No. No. And No. thanks
0/0	No. No. No. F that vaccine.
0/0	No. Not at all. I will not get vaccinated.
0/0	No. Not yet.
0/0	No. Stop im not having it go away
1/1	No. There is nothing in the vaccine that could "infect" someone. Please stop with the BS.
0/0	No. They. Just want to kill us! This is not a joke!
0/0	No. Why would a healthy person who never gets sick take a drug that is almost guaranteed to affect their health
0/0	No. it was rushed to market with less than 6 months of testing, the only vaccine in history to be approved in less than 4 years. It was approved only because of the ‚ÄòCovid emergency‚Äô.
0/0/0/0	No.. Because I don't trust. because vaccines take 5 to 10 years to make, not 9 damn months
0/0	No...Never...Not me!!!!!!,
0/0	No...no....and no........
1/-1	Nobel Prize

0/0	Nobody forces you to get your vaccines for school. You just can t go to a public school without them
0/0	Nobody in my family has got the vaccine nor do we care to do so. We don't get flue shots either. If you feel better getting it go right ahead.
1/0	Nobody is forcing anyone to be vaccinated but if you want to drive a truck into the U.S or drive a truck into Canada you must be vaccinated.
1/1	Nobody is injecting nanotechnology into my body. PeriodT
1/1	Nobody is safe till everbodybis safe should be the adage and having artificial age restriction would be counterproductive.Let all age get vaccinated pronto!

0/-1	Nobody is taking vaccine don‚Äôt believe the news
0/-1	Nobody knows about the long term effects of this vaccine Same story over and over again.
0/0	Nobody knows how safe is the vaccination just because we have no long term study! This is the very first vaccination in the history without long term study. This vaccination had a 6 months compared to other vaccinations 1-2 years study for long term side effects.
0/0/0/0	Nobody knows how safe it is! That‚Äôs the big punchline! Get it? Wake the F up people!
0/0	Nobody knows the long term effect because no ones had these vaccinations in them that long one doctor has said it could lead to different cancers I've been walking around in this pandemic for a year I'm fine I'm taking no experimental vaccine god will protect you and your family
0/0	Nobody knows the long term effects and no one is held accountable if there is, I'll take my slim 99.97% chance of survival thanks.
0/0	Nobody knows the long term effects of these mRNA vaccines and that is a concern

0/0	Nobody needs any untested vaccination for a virtually harmless virus
0/0	Nobody needs the covid vaccine or boosters
0/0	Nobody needs this toxic cocktail. Covid has a 99.7% recovery rate even without intervention. This is the definition of crimes against humanity.
0/0	Nobody should be forced to be injected with anything regardless of their type of job. I hope many of them quit their jobs!
1	Nobody should be forced...but you should get it anyway.
0/0	Nobody should be getting this "vaccine" end of story!
1/0	Nobody should ever be forced to inject anything into their body, meanwhile I have to live around unvaccinated people coughing and sneezing.... Oh okay
0	Nobody wants that vaccine except a percentage of Sheeple. Witches Brew!
1/1	Nobody's died from the vaccine, no. Only covid.
0/-1	Nobody's forcing anyone to get a vaccine. They're only saying that if you aren't vaccinated, you can't go shopping, eat at a restaurant, hold a job, receive medical care, leave your home, or participate in society. You're still free to go live in the woods as a hermit. For now, at least.
0/-1	Nobody's forcing you to listen to me. Not like getting vaccinated....
1/-1	Non of the thing you listed will keep them for spreading the virus. Yes, you have ‚Äúrights‚Äù but every right also has corresponding Obligations and Responsibilities.
0/0/0/0	Non of what the government says. Once a liar always a liar
0/0	None of it, don't trust it. You will have vaccine regret.
0/0/0/0	None of my family will take this posion . It is that simple . Exile us from society. If so stop all taxes and do not step foot on my land or the dogs will be released
1/1	None of the Worlds Covid Vaccines were ever supposed to prevent infection. Silly miss-reporting on a public health issue like this only serves to help the lunatic fringe and anti Vaxers spread fear and confusion.
0/0	None of the manufactures are liable for the vaccines they produce. So if you get any negative side effects its is not their responsibility. So why should I trust them if they have no liability what so ever or reasons to make sure it is safe. Since they have immunity for any negative consequences.
0/0	None of them look so healthy to trust them. I think they spread the virus and than they vaccinate us these mutants.
0/0	None of these are safe.
0/0	None of these vaccines should even be on the market. They‚Äôre going to have severe outcome so you can‚Äôt reverse. Just watch the world population drop in the fall. Watch.
0/0	None of those people who would like to stay alive and healthy should take the vaccine
1/1	None of us had sideffects besides sore arms and we have been protected from COVID. No regrets.
0/0	Nonono. only a small portion of doctors say its okay. lots of doctors dont agree.. its too early to say what side effects can be.. and YES side effects can be much worse than getting covid
0/0	Nonsensical scientific analysis which is under fraudulent information by a suspicious so called a professional Doctor,i have no doubt WHO gave u money to lie to the global community,u r a foolish idiot miss from hell,sies u r not ashamed of urslf
0/0/0	Noo I don't want to get a shot it's hurt
1/1	Noone is forcing you. However, it was tested. Take a wait and see approach. But don't condemn the work of scientists and medical professionals. Without it, nothing will change but more deaths.

0/0	Nope not gonna get the vaccine
0/0	Nope not me i live in Florida and will never get vaccinated and its my body my choice
1/0	Nope they don't have to talk to me at all. My body already produced what was necessary to fight covid. I don't want synthetic garbage in my system. Worked to hard to build a good immune system.
0/0	Nope! It's not going to stop..its only going to continue until people submit themselves to the "Jab!" It's called Controlling People!
0/0	Nope! Not a chance. You blew that chance with the vaccine that doesn't work and the 3 boosters to follow
0/0	Nope!! My Body My Choice............ so NOT going into me!!!
0/0	Nope, I'll wait for a later batch, see if anyone dies first from side affects
0/0	Nope, Moderna has never produced a successful vaccine to now... I'm quite sure all the Trumper's will be first in line

0/0	Nope, and if it's mandatory I'll find a cave to live in
0/0	Nope, im good...
0	Nope, not ever taking that stupid vaccine. I was born with a imune system for a reason.
1/-1	Nope, that is you. I would not be offended. As a pro vaxxer, I am going to wait for a while.
1/1	Nope, the vaccine doesn't stop cases, it just greatly lowers the rate of death if you do get it. Dumb, next.
0/0	Nope. HARD PASS!!!
0/0	Nope. It's not even a vaccine by definition.
0/0	Nope. Logically speaking, if todays vaccine hasn't eradicated your flu illness, and doesn't prevent you from getting it and dying from it. We can conclude that back then wouldn't make much of difference either Also, there's alot of factors, living conditions, diet , when the spanish colonist arrived that's when it spread.
0/0	Nope. My children will not have it. There is zero research about how children will react to it.
0/0	Nope. Passing my vaccine on to the next in line.
0/0	Nope. so far there is negative FX to those that have already taken it & a few have perished. Of course some have to kick the bucket for the system to work, but that's not how I'm going out.
0/0	Nope. still not getting it. Hell I get a reaction to the flu vaccine since they added swine flu to it years ago. Prior to that no reactions.
0/0	Nope.. if u gotta force ppl to take it or tell me I can‚Äôt fly or go here or there wout it then this is more then a virus ü¶† Even if President Trump told me to .. there is no way.. God gave us an immune system and that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs for.. üëç

1/1	Normal Life will soon return. Just keep doing what‚Äôs important. Take your shot!
0/0	Normal vaccines require 8 to 15 years of rigorous testing! So far no mRNA vaccines have passed the animal testing phase....but this 10 month old PfizerBioNTech/Moderna "non trials tested animal" vaccine is safe for humans. What could possibly go wrong. These evil b-tards will do anything for power and money!
1/-1	Normalcy can't come soon enough, but we are almost there.
0/0	Normalizing vaccine failure...classic! Up is down, what happened to the common sense of the people? Good lord we are in trouble
0/0	Normally I'm an anti vaxxer but this experimental jab, the first of its kind, made in a matter of months, entire testing phases skipped, results based on tiny samples, from a company who've paid out billions in compensation, with all legal safeguards removed, for a virus with a 0.14% fatality rate, has really got me tempted!
0/0	Norway Sounds Alarm As 23 Elderly Patients Die After Receiving Pfizer Vaccine

0/0	Norway patient died after being injected with covid 19 vaccine
0/0	Not 1,2 or 3.. Tks!
0/0	Not FDA approved so how can one say these are safe and effective? If I tried to peddle a product I created as safe and effective for xyz ailment and it wasn't FDA approved I would be in trouble! I guess the most corrupt government agency gets a free pass on lies. What's new.
0	Not FDA approved, there are cases where people and teens have died from the vaccine. I am not getting mine. Nothing odd about that.
1/0	Not OP, but I told my grandparents that I'd rather them hate me forever and never talk to me again but be vaccinated, because I love them and want them to be alive a long time even if it means they live their lives without me. I'd rather know they were safe and alive even if it meant they never wanted to see me again. I meant it. It worked.
0/-1	Not Satisfied your information
0/0	Not a chance in Hell I'd have my child take this poison. They are out of their minds. I thank god daily that I have a wife that works in the medical field. I thank god she's on the front lines of seeing what that poison dart is doing to her patients.
1/1	Not a conspiracy.
0/0	Not a risk I‚Äôm willing to take when I‚Äôve already survived the virus , I trust nature over science any day , science is never exact , as we are seeing with all the problems
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	Not a single chance in hell I will take this mandatory or not
0/0	Not a single chance in hell I will take this vaccine
0/0	Not a single person should be taking this poison
1/1	Not a single unvaccinated person should be allowed in a hospital when they get sick. Just put them in a circus tent, and let the show begin. It is time to stop endangering our medical staff. They have made their choice. And if tracing finds they have infected people, they should financially pay the price.
0/0	Not a vaccine and untested ....go figure
0/0	Not a vaccine at all, it‚Äôs designed to put a nano chip in you . 5 g will activate it
0/0	Not a vaccine if you can still get the virus, they labeled it wrong
0/0	Not a vaccine. It doesn‚Äôt work you retards.
0/0	Not a vaccine... this is mRNA gene editing
0/0	Not accept the vaccine due to safety concerns.
1/1	Not against the vaccine, against forcing people to take it without them becoming second class citizens while huge corporations profit from it
0/-1	Not an anti vaxxer but the vaccine seems kinda suspicious
0/0/0/0	Not an anti-vaxxer. Just not happy to be a guinea pig.
1/1/1/1	Not anti vaccine or anything and I plan on getting the covid one
0/-1	Not anti vax but I am anti this vaccine (it's not a vaccine but an experimental mRNA). Natural immunity is the way forward - I've had it and what should be carried out, are antibody tests on all prior to anyone 'choosing' to have this jab
0/0	Not anti vax!!! Pro science, pro freedom, pro choice, pro life, pro evidence, pro morals
0/0	Not anyone. Only those who are vaccinated. Unvaccinated are safe.
0/0	Not approved by FDA or Health Canada (only for emergency), trials not over yet. No thanks.
0/0	Not at all in such a corrupt evil world, NOT! Vaccines always contained malicious ingredients and ulterior motives! Must boycott al synthetic Rx and warn others! :(
1/1/1/1	Not being vaccinated is like starting life on hard mode.
1/1	Not carrying out mass vaccination would only prolong the pandemic.
0/0	Not confident that the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S. is taking the needs of Black people into account.
0/0	Not confused about this vaccine but I do believe that it will mess up our DNA No thank you
0/0	Not consenting to take part in a medical experiment where the manufacturer has ZERO LIABILITY if you die and does not intend to publish SAFETY DATA for two years does not make you anti-vax - it makes you ANTI-STUPID.
1/1	Not convinced by the French data? Look at the positive impact of #COVID19 vaccination in Switzerland
1/0	Not dumb at all but I think platelet abnormalities DO occur during natural infections, with pretty much every virus under the sun.
1/1	Not dutch but an immigrant from the UK. I will definitely get it but I don't mind waiting a bit for the people who really need it to have it first.
0/0/0/0	Not enough money in the world to make me get a corona virus vaccine.
0/0	Not enough testing was done, so we don't know how this will affect anyone
0/0	Not even FDA approved. Y‚Äôall are promoting poison. Already seen one person I know personally get sent to the hospital due to complications from the vaccine. She‚Äôs paralyzed on the right side of her body.
0/0	Not ever taking that vaccine
1/0	Not everyone wants that crap, for a disease that has a 90 percent cure rate.
0/-1	Not everyone wants that vaccine.
0/0	Not everyone who refuses to get COVID-19 vaccine are anti-vaxxers. There is a reason why vaccines normally take years to test and produce. This whole rushed process of less than one year development makes me question the legitimacy of the COVID-19 vaccine specifically. Not vaccines in general.
1/1	Not everything is a conspiracy. Get vaccinated people.
1/1/1	Not feeling quite this fresh today but glad to be moving forward #vaccine #worthit
0	Not for me thank you. I have a God given immune system and I do not consent. But hey, to the presenters of this video, don't let me influence you...enjoy your jab.
0/0	Not for me thanks.
0/0	Not for me. Get ready for zombie apocalypse
0/0	Not for me. Give the injection to the the government
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	Not for me. Start getting ready for the zombie apocalypse.
0/0	Not for me. The positives they argue are extremely vague while the adverse effects are visible and clear. It's like Clint Eastwood and now the government is saying "Do You Feel Lucky Punk?" I'll get by with your Black Seed Cumin and Honey before getting the jab.
0/0	Not friendly to some people have long illness
0/0	Not friendly to some sick people
0/-1	Not get the vaccine until they remove the waiver period
0/0	Not getting a shot for something I have 99% chance of surviving
1/1	Not getting a vaccine harms other people.
0/0	Not getting covid shot...no one knows what the long term results will be
0/0	Not getting it unless my job makes it mandatory. I'm fine wearing my mask and distancing in public indefinitely, I've made it this long without getting covid im comfortable just continuing like this.
0/0	Not getting it. It‚Äôs a hoax.
0/0	Not getting one and I know I‚Äôm not alone. The country will have a massive problem on their hands if they try to make vaccines ‚Äúmandatory‚Äù
0/0	Not getting that shit vaccine.
0/0	Not getting the flu or the COVID vaccine! No thank you!!
0/0	Not getting the vaccine and the only mask I wear is thinner than paper also I just wore that mask through the airport and nobody said anything
1/1	Not getting the vaccine because you‚Äôre worried about potential side effects is like not eating because you‚Äôre worried about choking to death
1/1	Not getting the vaccine really shows how we don't care other people.
0/0/0	Not getting the vaccine, never had a vaccine and I am perfectly healthy and fine!
0/0	Not getting the vaccine, never had a vaccine and I am perfectly healthy and fine!.
0/0	Not getting the vaccine, not because of mis information. Because not enough time behind it
1/0	Not getting vaccinated is no different than someone not wearing a helmet or using their seat belt.
0/0	Not going to alter my DNA, No thanks...Going to make a world of stepford wives
0/0	Not going to be a human test animal
0/0	Not going to happen. I am still not getting vaccinated.
0/0/0/0/0	Not going to take it
0/0/0	Not going to take it.
0/0	Not going to take it. My kids are allergic to some of the stuff in the vaccine
0/0	Not going to take itüöÆ
1/1	Not gonna lie, this sounds stupid. Why would you NOT get the vaccine if it was available for you? I understand the concept of let the at risk people get it first, but Elon has a lot of people depending on him. If he goes down for 2-3 weeks, thats a big deal for his employees and companies.
0/0	Not gonna take it.
1/-1	Not good news, at the moment. Safety first.
1	Not had a single death from clots in Wales but have over 5500 deaths from covid19. Had both my jabs with no side effect so Bravo UK.
0/1/0	Not had any Covid vaccine and not going to have one either. Sky News' financial donor Bill Gates, said in 2020 "not absolutely everybody needs a vaccine." So I've gone with that, coupled with the lack of mid and long term side effects data plus I've had Covid and as I work with the general public 4 days a week, I've not contracted it again (so far, since 2020) I'm guessing my immune system is fully functional!
0/0	Not having it ever!
1/0	Not having the vaccine does not mean that covid 19 will kill you once infected, so the jab should be optional.
1/1	Not hesitant to get it I can not even take one
1/1	Not immediately, because I'm healthy and I have a job that allows me to work 100% from home. So I have the illusion, that I'm not in immediate danger and can be without it for a while. Also, others will need it urgently and it is safer for me to wait for the dust to settle. In the medium term I will definitely want to get the shot as I'm organizing community stuff, where I do meet plenty of people. Also, I think sooner or later you'll have to present a certificate to have been vaccinated for travelling internationally. This is already the case for many countries for yellow fever.
0/0	Not in a million years i take the poisson shot , you can take mine
0/0	Not in any hurry to get the vaccine. I'll wait until I'm forced, coerced, pushed into a corner, threatened to lose all my freedoms, until everyone who wants it has had it. At the point I have no choice any further, I will get the J&J vaccine instead of the M&P one, that is of course if "they" allow me to get the vaccine they do not "prefer" we get. I had something I thought was the flu in late December 2019, I later grew to believe it was Covid. I lost my sense of taste and smell and only recently have those two senses started to return. I am an 82 year old female, I think my immune system kicked in just fine and I got through the Covid in about a week of feeling lousy.
0/0	Not in my body. Don‚Äôt trust them
0/0	Not intend to be vaccinated against COVID-19 due to lack of trust.
0/0	Not interested in any of vaccines ,ill best die naturally then be your gineapig or zombie mode luminati based vaccines ,if we dnt take we cnt use our money wtf youll playing God seriously satanist all of youll
0/0	Not interested, I survived covid19 with home remedies so I don't see any reason to be vaccinated.
0/0	Not just clots! It is the dangerous combination of clots with low platelets! It is deliberate misinformation to compare clots from contraceptive use and this reaction from vaccine. The increasing instances of of this complication only becoming apparent. Govt spin reproduced!
0/0	Not listening to this bs it‚Äôs totally not safe
0/0	Not me or my family!
0/0	Not me, never!!
0/0	Not me, not here, not now, not ever.
0/0	Not me. That's for damn sure.
0/0	Not much reason to be hesitant about most other known and established vaccines. However, every reason to be hesitant about the covid ones‚Ä¶
1/1	Not my turn yet. I will be vaccinated when it is available for me.
1/1	Not news to me. I‚Äôm a HCW in a small acute hospital and two staff have already told me they‚Äôre not sure they‚Äôll have it. I said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll knock you over running to be first in the queue to get it‚Äù.
0/0	Not on their life I'm gonna take that damn vaccine! LOL
0/0	Not once Dr.Fraud-ci interview with the REAL DOCTORS who will lay all the facts out and tell him the truth! All they are doing is promoting vaccines for this so called FLU virus.
1/-1	Not one rational reason left to not unfreeze the import of vaccines, get Pfizer, moderna, Sputnik and johnson and johnson in, let the rich pay more their vaccines, allocate the 3000 crores to ramp up Covishield, let go of central control over vaccines or
0/1	Not one rational reason left to not unfreeze the import of vaccines, get Pfizer, moderna, Sputnik and johnson and johnson in, let the rich pay more their vaccines, allocate the 3000 crores to ramp up Covishield, let go of central control over vaccines or allot by case load. Now.
0/0	Not only allergic reaction. It can damage your nervous system for good. Known as Guillain Barre syndrome. And your doctor will say, it's a rare neurological disorder.
1/1	Not only are anti-vaxxers spreading lies and misinformation, they‚Äôre also spreading the virus and increasing the odds of vaccine -resistant mutations to occur by giving the virus more chances to replicate and thereby more chances to mutate and find a partially vaccinated person or a vaccinated person with a compromised immune system, where it can develop into a vaccine resistant strain.
1/1	Not only does it not have such a high survival rate, but you seem to be mistakenly thinking as long as you don‚Äôt die from it you are fine. It causes serious long term health issues if you do survive. Get your jab
0	Not only in germany who have this problem ,i dont trust any vaccin ,and why over 60 very stupide,im not taking IT
1/1	Not only is providing vaccines to the rest of the world the ethical thing to do, it‚Äôs the only way we can tamp down the global burden of COVID-19 enough that we ourselves are safe.
1/1	Not only protecting yourself but others that you care about too!
0/0	Not peer reviewed or through regulatory approval yet - a bit of patience is due!
1/1	Not positive but PRETTY SURE my husband, who is a quadriplegic, now qualifies to get the vaccine ü§û There are some (small but) alarming studies about spinal cord injuries and COVID-19 mortality rates so we‚Äôve been holding our breath until he‚Äôs vaccinated. Hoping to exhale soon.
0/-1	Not really... Let the people take the vaccin who is voluntary want it.. Don't force the people take vaccin then that is fair.
1/1	Not rich enough, or old enough to get a vaccine, anytime soon. Rough estimates for me, and my family are April. So damn frustrating losing everything, while watching some folks that found a way to get go back to normal. That‚Äôs great for the people that are following the guidelines. Not everyone is. Watching younger folks that got it because their family has hospital administrators, bs like that doesn‚Äôt really help my faith in humanity. It‚Äôs still about who you know. The ‚Äúextras‚Äù are told to people, so they‚Äôre in the right place at the right time. I‚Äôve been told my life doesn‚Äôt matter, and I believe it when I see people skipping the line. By the time some of get help, it‚Äôs not going to matter. We‚Äôll be out on the streets. It‚Äôs really hard, after a year of isolation, to not hate everyone.
0/0/0	Not safe enough for me to put it into my body
1/1	Not saying this is the right way to do things, but hopefully US continues to ramp up its production of the vaccine even after a majority of its citizens get vaccinated.
1/1	Not scared of getting sick myself, but scared of infecting others. I want to be able to meet family who are in the riskgroup!
0/0/0	Not sure COVID-19 vaccine is necessary to combat the virus.
1/-1	Not sure this is the case. My work sent 22k 1a invitations, and about 8k people scheduled a vaccine. There is undoubtedly hesitation on the part of many people, even in healthcare.
0/0	Not sure to take this vaccine. A friend of mine is dead for the vaccine
0/0	Not sure what's in it but I'm not doing it.
0/0	Not takeing it noob ha ha ha dont take nobody covid fake belive me it took 1 year not good 10 years that what it take for the vaccine
0/0	Not taking a Trump Administration vaccine that‚Äôs was rushed NOPE
0/0	Not taking a vaccine made in less then a year
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	Not taking a vaccine made in less then a year that bill gates is behind.
0/0	Not taking an experimental drug
0/0	Not taking an experimental drug. My body is not a clinical study.
0/0	Not taking any of the stabs under any circumstances.
0/0	Not taking any of the stabs under any circumstances. Not interested in playing Chinese Roulette with my life. The ones hesitating or those downright refusing here, there and everywhere probably have come to the same conclusion.
0/0	Not taking any vaccine might save your life.
0/0	Not taking it and shouldn‚Äôt be forced too they got y‚Äôall where they want ya this isn‚Äôt going near my kid or me been taking care of myself all my life I pay my taxes keep your guns people
0/0	Not taking it at all.
1/1	Not taking it into your body is your absolute right. I HAVE had my first shot. I am 76 yrs OLD. LOL I won't live for ever but don't want Covid either.
0/0/0/0	Not taking it. Go ahead - make my day!
0/0	Not taking it. Turned it down twice. Overhyped flu
0/0	Not taking the Covid vac
0/0	Not taking the mystery ingredients of that vaccine, period!.
1/0	Not taking the virus is like peeing in the pool. It is your choice but it ruins it for everyone. We need segregated "pools" for the unvaccinated. Separate but equal restaurants, gas stations, etc for the dirty butts.
0/0	Not taking this. Not worth the risk. Already in a low-risk group.
1/1	Not that I have a choice, but I'm going to wait until healthcare, first responders, seniors, veterans, etc have gotten it first. Hopefully I can get the shot by next December.
0/0	Not the crime against humanity planned demic
1/0	Not the vaccine but the transport. Also they have only been approved for emergency usage.
0/0	Not to mention it‚Äôs the only vaccine in history to not have a long term study control group before it hit the market. Also the fact this is also the first vaccine in history to ever use ‚Äúmrna‚Äù for an ‚Äúessential vaccine (like chicken pox, tb etc). Two huge firsts for mankind.
0/0	Not to mention that any even considering taking this vaccine should read up on what RNA is and how it basically directs the DNA structure. You may not be concerned with how an untested mRNA vaccine will alter your DNA, being that as an adult, you are likely fully formed, no telling how it may affect you, but a young child? Or have you considered what the most minute alteration to the structure of YOUR DNA may affect any offspring? Myself, I am beyond that concern, still there is no way I will take that or any other vaccine!
0/0	Not too bothered about the 'after jab' effect but I have chosen to decline the vaccine, as have other family members. Good luck to all making their choices.
1/1	Not too worry, at this rate of roll out there will be a lot of vaccine varieties by the end of the year or first half of next year
0/0/0	Not trust doctors and hospitals.
0	Not unless I am given a list of every single ingredient in the vaccine. And because I ask for the list of ingredients they must comply. The reason for asking is they have a tendency to put in additional ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù ingredients on vaccines that actually cause health problems.
0/0	Not until it is safe for the most vulnerable kids to be there, no. Not until it is safe for the kids with the highest incidence of asthma, blood Pb levels, PFAS exposures, and other environmental injustices that dangerously complicate their COVID risk exposure.
0/0	Not until it passes actual long term testing for potential future unknown side effects. The fasted a vaccine ever got from research to market was 15 years. To push it like this is absolutly reckless and borders on malpractice for political gain. Makes me sick to my stomach thinking about it.
1/1	Not using rhe AZ vaccine is madness. This is an unprecedented health emergency and now some governments are getting as hysterical as the anti-vaxxer nut jobs.
0/0	Not vaccinated and wont be. I have been living my normal life and will continue to do so . No mask no social distancing. Been with family as much as usual. Noone will keep me from my family
0/0	Not vaccinated people are protected because natural immunity exist , the mutation of the virus has helped us
0/0	Not vaccinated, and nothing is stopping me from going back to "normal"
0/0	Not vaccinated, still ain't get COVID. Anybody else?
0/0	Not vaccinated....never had covid despite my 3 children and my partner (vaccinated) all had covid.
1/1	Not vaccinating children is a form of child neglect and those types of parents should have CPS called on them.
0/0	Not vaccinating is the safest way to live
1/0	Not vaccinating your kids only works fine so long as everyone around them IS vaccinated.
0/0	Not vaccine but pure love
0/0	Not vaccine hesitant... more like vaccine-not-gonna-get-it

0/0	Not vaxxed and I haven‚Äôt been to the doctor or hospital in the past 2 years
0/0	Not vaxxed. COVID twice. Still kicking. I should have died 194 times by now.
1/0	Not wanting a mandate and dying from a virus are not the same thing.
1/1	Not wanting to be vaccinated is one thing, this is terrorism. I cant agree that's something nice. People who want the vaccine (myself included) should not have to fear something like this happening
0/0	Not wanting to put something in my body that has been proven to not work, no thank you. You do what you want, afford me the same respect of choice.
1/1	Not worried, we get the flu shot every year one more won‚Äôt make a difference. The more protection the better for us
0/0	Not worth the risk. Let natural selection do its job. Only the strong will survive.
1/1	Not you all thinking you know more than thousands of scientists, doctors, and researchers with PhD's who all agree that it's safe
0/0	Note to Self Stop taking Jabs!!
1/1	Note what he said at the beginning and the end: we were able to get to finished vaccine because of all the research into other coronavira over more than a decade. They did not start from scratch! Get the vaccine!
1/-1	Nothing about the Anti-Vaccine certificate protests in denmark i see
0/0	Nothing about the long-term effects the culling begins
0/0	Nothing anyone will ever say will make me get it.
0/0/0/0/0/0	Nothing beats a strong immune system. There is no money in it.
0/0	Nothing beats the immune system. Especially young children. Deal with the sickness If and when they become Sick.
0/-1	Nothing but complete madness. Learn the truth about the vaccines. It‚Äôs all on my Twitter page.
0/0	Nothing but propaganda! The vaccines are not safe and were created for evil purposes. Only God can help us now!
1/-1	Nothing can prevent infection if you're exposed to any virus. Vaccines just lower the chances of serious illness/death, not infection
0/0	Nothing can prove that the product being injected to these people is the very vaccine. They are being given a different substance but they want to persuade us with the fake posts and later inject us their real vaccine which may be or is mere poison... Beware of such fake promotions...
0/0	Nothing changes in terms of rules whether you are vaccinated or not. Granted are your chances of catching it are dimished as are your risk of being very sick, but at what cost? Still too much is not known about these vaccines. Of course not everyone is at high risk of catching it either.
0/0	Nothing from the government or their appointed scientists
1/1	Nothing is 100% but the vax most certainly lowers risk of catching it significantly 70-80%.
1/1	Nothing is completely certain but in the UK there is the Phase III trial group for the oxford zeneca vaccine with no significant damage and 90% immunity, and the 100,000 dead group. I prefer the odds first group so I had the first vacination on Thursday.
0/0	Nothing is free in the world and by taking the vaccine you essentially become the product!
1/1	Nothing is perfect . people can also die from flu shots
1/1	Nothing is stopping me from getting vaccinated against covid19. I am fully vaxxed now (Moderna/Pfizer). If a booster is recommended I will get that as well.
0/0/0/0	Nothing like living in a free country! This is the start of the mark of the beast! Sheep wake up
0/0	Nothing says "trust the science" like "you can't sue us if something goes wrong."
0/-1	Nothing says confidence in their vaccine quite like lobbying to make themselves immune from lawsuits. It's a real confidence builder for me!
0/0	Nothing scarier than a vaccine that took less than a year to manufacture. Most vaccines take years to perfect. I just hope we didn't rush this too much.
0/0	Nothing should be mandatory..nobody knows the long term risks associated with these vaccines, and it should be an individuals choice to accept the risk, or not.
1/1	Nothing to be concerned about. Its completely safe.
0	Nothing to say about all the side effects sending people to the hospitals ?
0/0	Nothing you can do because I'm standing by my decision not to take it. Just that simple.
0/0	Notice how Thomas Reuters & Facebook are fact checking anything that speaks out against this vaccine? No surprise to see both of them are listed as partners on the World Economic Forum website along with Pfizer...
1/1	Notice how few people with a medical degree actually is against the vaccine
0/0	Notice how he laughs when talking about vaccines, evil creepy satanist. A big NO from me.
0/0	Notice how it was mentioned multiple times that they actually don't know if the boosters are effective and they're still doing clinical trials on the boosters. So that's where we come in. They're pushing for us to be part of one big clinical trial...
0/0	Notice how the government is not telling us to consult with a doctor before taking the vaccine üíâ you have to be a different kind of stupid to take a rushed vaccine.
1/1	Notice how the people who r pro-vaccine are all properly educated and the people who are skeptics aren‚Äôt lmao
0/0	Notice how they call it a "jab" now, to make it sound like some routine thing we had as kids to keep the lergie away, as opposed to an experimental gene altering injection.
0	Notice how they never compare to people who've had it previously.
1/0	Notice the groups of people who are never involved with anti vaxxers. Doctors, virologists, chemists, teachers, scientists
1/-1	Novavax is a protein-based vaccine that experts hope will also persuade anti-vaxxers to get inoculated. We also look at the vaccines available and how they work. Plus: We meet a nurse who is refusing to get vaccinated. On this COVID-19 Special, we look at the different available vaccines
1/1	Now I will get J&Js
0/0	Now I‚Äôm definitely not getting it Poison . DON‚ÄôT TAKE IT. You‚Äôve been warned...
1/1	Now anti-vaxxers are threatening to undo all the medical advancements made in the field of vaccines and bring back pre-vaccine lethal diseases all because they believe in misinformation that has long since been debunked.
0/-1	Now here we go again: "the benefits of the vaccine outweighs the risk for the VAST MAJORITY of the people"! and how people should know if they belong to the "vast majority" or to the "rare minority"? People SHOULD be given full discloser about potential side effects, and THEY should decide for themselves IF they should, or should not take the vaccine. As far as I know, there is no test offered before taking the vaccine to determine if the person about the be vaccinated blogs to the "vast majority" or not! then how can a doctor give the advice to anyone, "you SHOULD take the vaccine because the benefits outweighs the risk for the vast majority of people"? are you suggesting the person whom you telling these words is part of the "vast majority"? you know that as a fact?
1/1/1	Now i realized that vaccines really give us the immunity from the sickness rather than not having vaccinated...Thank you so much Doc.for that very clear information...God bless i more
1/1	Now if only I could get my vaccine in my area in San Antonio, Texas 78233! I wish I could cut in line like these celebrities. Lol
1/1	Now if only the general public can get vaccinated before summer that'd be great.
0/0	Now if they could only find the link between covid and a vaccine that works
1/1	Now if we can only get people (like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Sarah Palin, and so on) to stop spreading anti-vax nonsense we might have a fighting chance. People are so stupid today.
1/1	Now its up to you, either get rid of the virus or let it mutate into something stronger so that all this is useless and we'd need to go back to basics.
1/0	Now it‚Äôs getting totally out of hand!!!!F Offfff
1/0	Now lets eradicate HPV , AIDS ETC :)
0/0	Now lets wait 10 years to see are there any sideeffects and maybe then i will take it!
1/1	Now let‚Äôs hope we have the staff to carry out the huge vaccination programme needed.
0/0	Now our wonderful MPs are going to ‚Äúmix‚Äù the vaccines? Come on people surely this is the final straw, surely enough is enough? This mixing and matching has to be ‚ÄúFrankenstein science‚Äù?
0/0	Now our wonderful MPs are going to ‚Äúmix‚Äù the vaccines? Come on people surely this is the final straw, surely enough is enough? This mixing and matching has to be ‚ÄúFrankenstein science‚Äù? And yet the sheeple sit watching bbc and Eastenders! ‚ÄúStill think it‚Äôs a pandemic‚Äù?
1/1	Now prick me already. So ready for this shit to be over.
1/1	Now that there's a vaccine, everyone that takes it will be 100% immune and will no longer need to social distance or wear a mask!
1/0/1/1	Now that this is approved, I'm going to get it. If it's been given full approval I have no reason to believe it is any more or less dangerous than any other vaccine I've gotten.
1/1	Now that vaccination has started we are closer to the end of this era
1/1	Now that we are starting to see positive results from the vaccines, I'm excited to watch the fight over who gets to claim credit for saving the world. One thing history has taught us is that it will definitely NOT be the people who actually did all the work.
1/1	Now that we‚Äôre vaccinated from the Trump virus, I wish they would come out with a vaccine against the ignorance of anti-vax and trump supporters.
1/-1	Now that‚Äôs when it‚Äôs dangerous to get vaccinated but you have to trust other peaple who are able to get vaccinated to get vaccinated
0/0	Now the real pandemic is going to start.
0/0	Now there is talk of the new Flurona mutant, flu and Covid have merged apparently, they will be pushing even more vaccines..... You just can't make it up, and what a day to be announcing it.... Happy New Year for Big Pharma....
0/0	Now they are trying to justify why they went after our DNA using the PCR test. Caught. Stop lying. We're not brain dead. You wish!
0/0	Now they want to mix the vaccines? My dear God!! It's all a horrible experiment!!!
1/-1	Now this is a Professor more people should listen to. To set them at ease about the Vaccine that has been developed. Great information.
1/1	Now this is a good quote to put risk in perspective: "You have a greater chance of being in a car accident on the way to getting this vaccine than you have of having a problem from this vaccine."
1/1	Now this is the good news we have all been waiting for.
1/1	Now time for the antivaxxers to get forced to get vaccinated or be refused ventilators. Ventilators shouldn't be wasted on people who prefer to take medicine for livestock than a life saving vaccine.
0/0	Now we are sheeps not human.
0/1	Now we have the most rapidly produced vaccine in history for a virus that is already mutating.
1/1/1/1	Now we just need a vaccine for stupidity!!! Looking at you antivax people and you "covid isn't real" people :)
0/0	Now we know everyone can get it either way and isreals study found even after the 4th dose it doesnt protect against omi No one cares . JUST DONT MADATE SOMETHING THAT DOESNT WORK
1/1/1/1/1/0/1/1	Now we need a vaccine to stop the spread of stupidity as in antivaxers and antimask types!
1/1	Now, should I be in the US/much of Europe where the virus remains rampant, then I‚Äôll certainly take the first vaccine being offered for the risks out there is far greater than the risks of the short trial and follow up periods of the available Western vaccines.
1	Now, the world is still a nasty crazy place out there, we need a lot of courage and we need a lot of resilience after that, and we will fall down before we stand up‚Ä¶ What really matters is the silence of the night in our conscience. We cannot control what happens but we can use what happens. We have so much reserves of love and support inside us, if we can just remember that in our mind and move on.
0/0	Now, you can't go on a cruise without the vaccine....guess I'll never cruise again.
0/0	Nueman\n against Adam both are of the same tribe and both playing both sides of the chessboard.
1/0	Number of confirmed #COVID19 cases:105M Number of COVID19 vaccine doses given: 120M Number of PROVEN DEATHS from COVID-19: 2,292,100 Number of PROVEN DEATHS from any COVID-19 VACCINE: ZERO I hope this puts things in the right perspective. Thank you. #vaccineswork #getyourshot
1/1	Number one, practically the whole world has been working on the vaccine so they've been able to share notes
0/0/0/0/0	Numerous people have already died from this vaccine and the corrupt agencies will never admit it.
0/0	Nurse for 16 years not taking this vaccine. I am walking away
1/1	Nurse had to hold my hand...√∞≈∏Àú‚ÄöI had yet to get the second part...did u guys take vaccine?
1/1	Nurse here. Tested positive Friday. Let me tell you something, If I had not received that moderna vaccine, I‚Äôd be dead. This thing kicked my ass so much. It was painful. It was agonizing. I‚Äôm still in the middle of it. Today, a little glimmer of hope when I woke up. My fever is at 101 instead of 102.3
0/0	Nurse is more afraid of vaccine than covid after working on covid patients..... what else do we need to hear really
1/1	Nurses and people in the medical industry are already getting vaccinated by the way. The data shows that everything goes as expected.
0/0	Nurses who took care of us during the hardest parts of this outbreak are being forced out of their jobs because of not getting a vaccination. Absolutely awful treatment to our "heroes" we used to thank so much.
1/1	Nursing home I work at has had zero cases among staff or residents since the first round of vaccines. Just got our second round last week as well. Morale is way up and the results have caused some vaccine doubters among the staff to sign up for the next vaccine round in two weeks. Definitely light at the end of the tunnel
1/1	OF COURSE I BLOODY WILL!!!! I‚ÄôD BE STUPID NOT TO. Only an idiot wouldn‚Äôt want to try staying alive and seeing his children marry and his grandchildren grow up.
1/1	OH lawd, now we have to put up with the 2nd and 3rd Generation anti-vaxxers.
0/0	OK LETS PUT THIS WOMAN TO THE TEST. WILL SHE TAKE LIABILITY FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THE VACCINE AND DIED?
1/1	OMG I'm sooo excited for this vaccine. Hope it comes soon man
1/1	OMG RIGHT IM GONNA GET VAXXED TOMORROW üòµüí´
0/0	OMG again use Africa for test!!!UNICEF business for wrong vaccine !!!!!
0/0	OMG how many times do people need to be told. The current vaccine doesn't stop you catching it, spreading it or dying from it!
0/0	OOOOPS you didn`t even bother to test it...I say LIARS and DESTROYERS....do your research
0/0	Obviously natural immunity is way better than the garbage vaccine
0	Obviously there will be side effects. What‚Äôs more disturbing will be the regular booster shots that may cause (if too regimentally administered) irreversible damage
1/1	Of course I will take the vaccine. It is significantly safer than many other previous vaccines. The side effects are like the other vaccines as well. So vaccines are the best there is.
1/1	Of course I will. I will not hesitate to get my vaccination. It is time to get contro9l of this pandemic and move on. This country is going to fail if we do not get our economy going again. We already have hundreds of thousands of businesses that have failed and more going under every day.
0/0	Of course NO!
1/-1	Of course everyone should be mandated to take all the vaccines ! Crazy world
1/1	Of course everyone should be vaccinated.
0/1	Of course it is. None of these Vaccines were given the proper amount of trials and time to study it which regularly takes at least five years. But to each their own, I just won‚Äôt be your test dummy
0/0	Of course it won‚Äôt hurt you immediately duh üôÑ. The side effects kicks in later.
1/1	Of course it works the current wave has been much less severe in countries with higher vax rates. The rabies vaccine doesn't even prevent rabies, it just gives you more time to get treatment. Its like saying "people still die wearing seatbelts so I'm not wearing them"
0/0	Of course it's a basic human right NOT to be forcibly injected with an experimental vaccine.
0/0	Of course it's a basic human right NOT to be forcibly injected with an experimental vaccine. Absolutely disgusting.
1/1/1/1	Of course it's safe! There's a chance you might get an allergic reaction, but it'll be over in mere hours!
0/0	Of course it‚Äôs moronic. Kinda like needing a vaccine for a virus with a 99.9 survival rate but here we are!
0/0	Of course nope!!The vaccine has many side effect.
0/-1	Of course not. It‚Äôs good news!
0/0	Of course people don‚Äôt want to inject a rushed product into their bodies.
0/0/0/0	Of course people don‚Äôt want to inject a rushed product into their bodies. All the old vaccines are fine. They‚Äôre tried and tested but this new one might be risky
0/0	Of course side affects are minimal now. Give it time. It takes an average of 10 to 15 years for a vaccine to be proven safe and effective. And through this trial period volunteers have died and suffered to ensure the safety of a vaccine. This experimental jab which is unproven is no good. Don't be a guinea pig.
0/0	Of course the cases have risen. They‚Äôve been ‚Äòvaccinated‚Äô. The same thing happened in the UK. Their deaths went up horrifically in Jan-Feb, France ‚Äòvaccinated‚Äô later so their surge is Feb-March.
0/0	Of course the vaccine boss comes out to say this, his job depends on it
0/0	Of course they are hesitant it‚Äôs literally killing people
0/0/0	Of course they lie! This vaccine is not about covid at all! These are vaccines of dehumanization. You will no longer be a divine creature. If you survive, you will become a toy in the hands of the enemy. Controlled and weak-willed.
1/-1	Of course vaccines aren't 100% safe. But here's the kicker: No medicine is!!
1/1	Of course vaccines aren't 100% safe.But here's the kicker: No medicine is!! They all have side effects, some more severe than others. It is always(!) a question whether the pros outweigh the cons.
1/1	Of course vaccines.
0/0	Of course we can‚Äôt blame the ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù but it‚Äôs ok to blame the dead victim.
1	Of course we can‚Äôt blame the ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù but it‚Äôs ok to blame the dead victim. RIP Kassidi.
0/1	Of course we show videos of the anti-shot takers only saying vague things (probably scripted) and not listing the real reasons, and also making it a race issue (even tho they already told us previously that the majority of the black community doesn‚Äôt want to take it). The media once again: Trust us. No one else. Just us. Don‚Äôt ask questions. Just stick this fluid in your body. Believe only the ingredients we told you are in there and nothing else.
1/1	Of course we will get vaccinated! There is no vaccine that provides 100% protection and unfortunately there are some that get serious side effects. But we must all be helped to stop the shit
1/1/1/1/1/1	Of course you should get it. What kind of nonsense question is that?
1/1	Of course, every sane person do vaccinate
1/1	Of course, in 1918 the population of the USA was about 103.21 million, while now it is 330.66 million, roughly three times as high. To lose the same proportion of people as in 1918, we'd have to hit a death total of about 2,025,000. Let's pray the vaccines do their job.
1/1	Of course, vaccinated people can get sick as well. They just have lower chances of getting serious symptoms that leads to hospitalization. Thus, not overcrowding the hospitals for people who really need it.
1/1	Of course, you have the freedom not to be vaccinated. But this freedom is exercised to the detriment of those who will not have the freedom to seek treatment for anything other than covid.
0/1	Of course. If you decide not to please stay home for the foreseeable future. It's irresponsible to possibly put others at deadly risk.
1/1	Of the 30 most vaccinated countries, 20 are in the EU. They are doing fine.
0/0	Of the alleged 650,000 ‚ÄúChina Flu‚Äù deaths .....how many can be attributed to the Biden vaccines?....70%?
1/1	Ofc no vaccine is 100% effective but this one could have saved her life or prevented severe disease. Still important to remember that these mRNA vaccines are some of the best on the market.
1/-1	Ofcourse you could get minor symtoms similar to the ones you get when catching covid, thats kind of how a vaccine works
1/1	Off to get my final Pfizer vaccine!!! I‚Äôm so lucky!! I will still wear my mask!!
1/1/1	Off to get my final Pfizer vaccine!!! I‚Äôm so lucky!! I will still wear my mask!! #vaccine
1/1	Off to get myself vaccinated! Let's do this!
0/0	Offcourse the vaccine caused the death
0/0	Official Public Health Data showing a 40% increase in Excess Deaths of the Under 65's suggests the #Covid_19 #CovidVaccine is to blame as Heart Disorders among 15-44-year-olds have soared up to 118% higher than the Five-Year-Average #ClotShot #JustSayNo
1/1	Officially boosted SyringeRed heartAdhesive bandage. Let‚Äôs all do our part . Get vaccinated or get your booster shot. We are all in this together!
1/1	Often a single dose is enough to stimulate long-term protection
0/0	Oh Jesus.. he also sent the devil.. the vaccine has not helped anyone from getting covid.. god also revealed the evil going on but so many sheep are completely fucking oblivious
1/1	Oh Yes, I got my 2nd dose thursday and went to bed that night. Woke up at 3A.M. with horrible body aches that lasted for 24 hours. But it was still worth it.
0/0	Oh and i hear it can have some awesomely fatal side effects how cool!
0/0	Oh and you can die and it is experimental and you can develop horrible adverse effects. We know this is about money and power and control!
1/1	Oh boy I can‚Äôt wait to get mine
0/0	Oh boy, 96% effective and lasts 6 months for a 99.9% survival rate virus, makes sense.
0/0	Oh boy, I bet I will have some haters commenting on this post. I am one of those who have opted not to take the vaccine. My primary reason for this is that I want to see studies regarding long term side effects. It is much too early to know what this vaccine may do to human bodies as time passes. Also, this is considered an experimental vaccine. I am not a guinea pig. I know there was a need for something to stave off this horrible virus early on, so I can understand rushing the vaccine. I have read that all the vaccines have been developed and tested by scientists and that it is said that it won‚Äôt cause harm in the long term. I am not satisfied with that answer. I want to know about possible side effects 2 years, 5 years, 10 years down the road. I‚Äôve been doing my research since this virus came out. I don‚Äôt proclaim to be a doctor or scientist by any stretch. But so far, I have learned that vaccinated people are catching and spreading the virus, just as much as unvaccinated people. They say the vaccine prevents people from having terrible symptoms and even death. That may be true, I just do not know. I do know several vaccinated people who have caught covid, but had milder symptoms. Another reason I have not taken the vaccine is that all I do know just doesn‚Äôt make sense. Information changes daily. Wear a mask, masks don‚Äôt stop the virus. Lock down, don‚Äôt lock down. We have already gone through the masking and lockdown and it didn‚Äôt do one bit of good in keeping people safe from covid. So here is my question. Why should I take an experimental vaccine that doesn‚Äôt keep me from getting or spreading covid and nobody can give me information regarding long term side effects. These vaccines are not made to actually stop covid. I‚Äôve also read that vaccines can cause viruses to mutate. I can‚Äôt rattle off all the science involved in that, but several articles I have read indicate that to be true. Covid is not the only vaccine that does this. Others, such as the flu vaccine, do it too. Does it make sense to take a vaccine that will cause mutations and more variants of the virus? The new vaccine coming out from Pfizer that is suppose to receive approval from the FDA has me raising my eyebrows. I don‚Äôt trust the FDA, look at what they have done with our medicines and foods. The stuff that goes into some of those things is pure poison to the human body. Also, why are GMO foods approved by the FDA? It‚Äôs all about money. But back to Pfizer. Did you know that Pfizer holds the record for receiving the largest criminal fine in history? They purposefully misrepresented a pain medicine that has since been removed from the market. How am I supposed to trust a company that did that? With all the controversy about the vaccines, why would I decide to take one that is manufactured by a crooked company? How do I know that it is safe? It is another rushed vaccine. Just because the FDA gives it their approval doesn‚Äôt mean that it is safer than any of the others. I‚Äôve read that the human immune system is 13 times more efficient at warding off covid than this newest vaccine. It is being pushed too hard. For a virus that has a 99% survival rate, what is the big to do over the vaccine? All this talk about carrying a vaccination card in order to get into various places is just ridiculous. That is just government controlling us. I have a right to say what goes into my body and what does not. The day someone comes to my door demanding that I take a vaccine will be the day when I know we are doomed, and our freedoms will be taken away one by one. I‚Äôm not downplaying the seriousness of the Covid 19 virus. It is a nasty bug than has killed lots of people. The death rates are not too high with the new variant, comparably speaking. But it is still nasty. I take precautions against getting sick. I take Vitamin D and Zinc and Vitamin C and Vitamin A, all have been proven to help keep covid away. There are some other avenues that I‚Äôm looking at as well. I stay away from crowds and practice good hygiene. And I pray. Basically, I don‚Äôt know enough about the vaccine to just blindly allow substances to be put in my body that no one can tell me won‚Äôt cause problems somewhere down the line. At this point, they are talking about booster shots for vaccinated people. How many booster shots will we have to have? One a year, like the flu? Or one everytime the virus mutates and brings about another variant? I‚Äôm just not up for that. Those are some of my personal reasons for deciding not to take the vaccine. Knowing what we know about it, I don‚Äôt know why people get so irate with folks like me who are critical thinkers and want answers. It‚Äôs none of my business if other take the vaccine. It‚Äôs their body and their decision. And it‚Äôs no one elses business whether or not I take the vaccine. It is my body and my personal choice to take it or not.
0/0	Oh boy...three injections is really three chances to play Russian Roulette with your immune system. Be wary.
0/0	Oh come on how do you expect your terrified brainwashed sheep to stay in line if you stop saying everyone is going to die of Covid if you don't get an ineffective vaccine!!!!
1/-1	Oh come on! No one has to vaccinate their kids! only those you want to keep!
0/0	Oh dear EUronews, this article hasn't even made it to the end of the day before the conclusions it tries to draw are shown invalid. Studies released today have conclusively shown 1 dose provides 76% efficacy for up to 12 weeks and validate the UK strategy of prioritising the first dose. Nice try lads.
1/1	Oh for God's sake. Get the vaccine you big babies and stop being such huge idiots.
0/0	Oh get another booster. And another one . I'm sure the boosters that only protect against the first couple strains will do fine again future variants.
0/-1	Oh golly, these two are simply fabulous!!!! Telling me about my "body" and how my body reacts when the thing is injected in my body.
0/0	Oh good, now we can get another shot that we don‚Äôt know what it is going to do to us!!
0/0	Oh gosh, those vaccines are not ready for human trial
1/1	Oh how the years have changed me. Now when I get excited about shots, it‚Äôs the vaccine kind. Ready to get my second
1/1	Oh just stop it! Comparing the various brands is just going to slow down the roll-out! I would happily take ANY vaccine I could get into my arm
0/0	Oh look! 90% of the comments on this feed are "conspiracy theorist."üòÑ Just because the media of all sorts are in on this covid hoax does not make it so. COVID IS A LIE! DO NOT TAKE THE "VACCINE!"
0/0	Oh look, it‚Äôs Bill Nye, Propaganda Guy.
1	Oh look, they found one guy to tell us vaccines are bad...
0/0	Oh look, we no longer respect your choice, despite all the people who are fully vaccinated and still contract covid-19
0/0	Oh lord. At least they‚Äôre not rushing to get their babies vaccinated for a shot not FDA approved yet
1/1	Oh man do I miss those polio drops. For some reason I liked the taste so much that I'd keep asking my mother later if I could have some more.
0/0	Oh man she's so annoying... it is not true that hospitalized people a mostly unvaccinated... FAKE
0/-1/-1	Oh man, my dad is getting the shot right now. I'm so worried.
1/-1	Oh man, the day I took vaccine shot, I slept for 10+ hours stat, such a relaxing sleep in months
1/1	Oh my goodness if this actually works and it becomes the cure or the ultimate suppressor for people who don't have it this is going to be a major milestone
1/1	Oh my. I feel AWFUL after the vaccine. And that is just a GLIMPSE of the full thing. Thank god i got the vaccine.
1/0	Oh nice, another Vaccine i wont be able to get.
0/0/0/0	Oh nooo people don't want to get an unproven and actually potentially dangerous vaccine for a virus that has a lower mortality rate than the flu nooooo
1/1	Oh now the anti vaccine idiots are at it. These are the people that help perpetuate diseases because they allegedly "know better" than science or medical professionals
0/1/0	Oh okay you are one of those who believes there is such a thing 'herd immunity'. There is no scientific evidence to suggest herd immunity can be obtained by vaccines. At best it is an observation which has become dogma as much of the science is with vaccines.
1/1	Oh please. I have friends who are nurses and doctors - they, along with the rest of the world are sick and tired of these loud mouth people who preach anti vaccines. I don‚Äôt feel sorry for the deceased. Keep up the good work to all of our medical personnel!
0/0	Oh really?Psalm 91 spoken over my life and family,that's what saved us not your so called vaccine.To GOD be the glory not your falseness and deceit.
0/0	Oh shite, "hang on," really? I go to a pub where no one has worn a mask for a year. What bullshite and when does this television drama (fictional soap) end? Do people really still believe this Event 201 shit show debacle is real?
1/-1	Oh shizer I got ze phizer
1/1	Oh so natural immunity is better?
0/0	Oh so the vaccine isn‚Äôt working....bummer!
1/1	Oh thank gosh. Finally!! I‚Äôm so excited. As soon as my parents can get this vaccine, I‚Äôll finally feel like I can relax a bit
0	Oh thanks for allowing people to choose their medicines. That's very American of you to give back freedoms that we were born with
0/0	Oh the wonderful vaccines have saved us all, but wait...I never had any
0/0	Oh well it must be all good then....if they tell us so then it must be fine....nothing to worry about....just obey and get in line
1/-1	Oh wow, in places where >90% of adults are vaxxed, somehow the vaxxed COVID numbers barely exceed the unvaxxed COVID numbers! Who would‚Äôve thought that‚Äôs how math works?!
1/1	Oh wow, the uneducated seem to be gathering for a field trip today‚Ä¶ Vaccine will not stop you getting it, it will lessen any ill effects. Say out loud now and it might stick
0	Oh wow... these doctors are literally lying to us. Let‚Äôs talk about how this is an MRNA injection. Not a vaccine. It‚Äôs a fact that a vaccine needs to be tested for 5 years or more. You doctors are lying through your teeth. Profit is more important to you than health. Ashamed.
0/0	Oh yea get the whole world trying experimental gene altering vaccines. Sounds like a great idea
0/0	Oh yeah make your appointment today, oops it's been paused due to being poison, hahhahahaahahh
1/0	Oh yeah, absolutely. People think antivax idiots are a new thing. Did you know the phrase "conscientious objector" originally referred, not to those who chose not to go to war, but to the British folks in the 1890s who were opposed to taking the smallpox vaccine?
1/1	Oh yeah. Get that immunity!
0/0	Oh yeah. Going out to get mine for sure! Not
0/0	Oh yes, Transparency and Trust are the very reasons for my hesitancy. I have had no COVID jabs for this very reason. Yes, happy to risk dying rather than simply accept an injection where data is not released. The first thing I checked in April 2020 was legal cases outstanding against Pfizer. The list was long . That alone was enough to stop me going any further regarding injections. I am not anti-vax, but legal cases against Pfizer eroded all trust.
1/1	Oh yes, because 5 minutes of Google research is much more than 20 years of medical expirience.
0/0	Oh! Now they say, "we should wait on the long term impact of the jabs!" --- Disturbing.
0/0	Oh, a toxic cocktail. Just what we need more of
0/0	Oh, hell no I‚Äôm not getting this vaccine
0/0	Oh, it works. But not for the intention of covid. Global genocide comes to mind..heart attacks, strokes, and blood clots are what these things produce..been hearing testimonies from funeral homes and what they are pulling out of the dead. We are in war.
1/-1	Oh, so did my grandma just choose to die on her own cuz she was bored then?!
1/1	Oh, so you‚Äôre a scientist now? Or just a doctor? The vaccine effort is international and peer reviewed! Think about that before spreading fear and mistrust on no base‚Ä¶
0/0	Oh, we'll know 10 years down the road when half of these people can't have kids. I sure as hell am avoiding that vaccine at all costs.
1/-1	Ohgawd...hurry! I am not going to survive this.... Hurry before I end up homeless
1/1	Ohhhhhh myyyyyyy cant wait for the vaccine,, MY HERO
1/1	Ohio needs vaccine. Not able to get an appointment.
0/-1	Oho it's really disgusting... I have friends in Arizona & 2 days back we had a very intense discuss on these killer vaccines. They all said will die but never take these satanic shots .. It's a bigging of mark of the beast 666
1/1	Ok I understand people being skeptical because the vaccine was kind of rushed but thinking that doctors are lying to you? That's beyond me
0/-1	Ok cool, you all get the vaccine so I don't have to :)
1/1	Ok great we are getting more vaccines and there working!!! WE WILL GO BACK TO NORMAL THIS SUMMER!!
1/1	Ok help me out here, with all of them antivaxx ranchers going to Coutts to protest vaccination, why do they vaccinate their cattle?
1/1	Ok here goes. Have had both Covid shots and will continue to wear a mask. I‚Äôll also get my flu shot in Oct. and continue wearing a mask during flu season. Come at me. #Vaccinate
1/-1	Ok iam Sputnik v vaccine take it
0/0	Ok if I`m supposed to trust anything you say, that video did not help you at all. I refuse the vaccination due to this video. It looks dangerous and I`m not wanting to die today. Dr`s already killed me twice with a needle, I`m not going to let you do it a 3rd time
0/-1	Ok let‚Äôs discuss effect of vaccination!Is a person getting vaccinated become proof of not getting corona ! Does vaccine ensure that a person infected with corona will not spread corona ? Vaccine can only save his own life, nothing else!Whereas we are talking rallies as spreader
1/1	Ok so I'm now totally sick of all this covid shit.. In And out of lockdown not seeing anyone or doing anything.. fuck it I'll be happy to take a jab.. get life moving again.. and the gyms open!.
0/0/0	Ok so basically they ramping up death shots got it
0	Ok so basically they ramping up death shots got it üëåüèΩ
1/1	Ok the vaccine is in needed
1/1	Ok vaccine is good to everyone. so go on qnd good luck!
0/0/0/0	Ok what happens if you take the vaccine and then you have an adverse reaction to it or even worse die. Who is liable? Answer: you are!
0/0	Ok yeah if it actually worked tho what about all the vaccinated people still dying from Covid?
1/0	Ok you take the vaccine- but still have to wear a mask- how can a virus be out- and create a vaccine less then a year of virus- how's that possible- when you don't a vaccine for other infections- all this less then a year
1/1	Ok, don't get vaccinated. And don't take up hospital/doctors resources if you get sick. Just stay home and see how it goes. I'm good with that. It might just save social security for those who do get vaccinated. Tough on the immunocompromised, so maybe the unvaccinated can where big virus hatsü¶†
1/1	Ok, so let‚Äôs look at the facts. In Australia, we have had 11 deaths caused by the vaccines from 50 million vaccinations.We have had 4153 deaths from 2.5 million cases of covid. Half of the patients in ICU are from 5% of the population that are unvaccinated.I will definitely take my chances with the vaccines.
1/1	Ok, so one person in the US has died from a Covid vaccine. 575,000 have died of Covid. It‚Äôs still an easy choice to get vaccinated. Also, one of the long term effects of Covid in people that survive the initial acute phase is blood clots. So...it‚Äôs a good idea to get vaccinated.
0/-1	Ok, what is the long term after effects?. Oh you don‚Äôt know because it has not been tested for long enough. 5-10yrs not 5-10 months The regulators who approved this also have a lot to answer to and also must be held accountable if anything was to go wrong.
0/0	Okay I'll start. This will make it very easy for you to try and convince me otherwise. - Vax doesn't stop transmission -covid small harm to kids -small chance of harm to young males from Vax. How does it benefit you, and my 3-year-old by getting the vaccine? Please tell.
0/0	Okay I'm not an antivaxxer or conspiracy theorist, but Johnson and Johnson? I learned not to trust their tear free shampoo, and I'm not making the same mistake again
0/0	Okay just some smug guy trying to make people feel small for feeling hesitant or not wanting it. Very reassuring. Basically telling you, you don't have rights. This nasty video is a great reason to consider NOT getting it.
0/0	Okay so you differentiate other pre-conditions from vaccine deaths, now do the numbers on fatalities due DIRECTLY from covid & get back to me
1/1	Okay then. I‚Äôll take AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Moderna. By taking all three I‚Äôll surely won‚Äôt get infected.
1/1	Okay!..I‚Äôll take a chance and get the jab
1/1/1/1	Okay, I'll have an immunity while y'all fucks are dying around me.
0/0	Okay...there‚Äôs a 99.9% recovery rate but your promoting an EXPERIMENTAL vaccine with ‚Äúperhaps‚Äù a 95% success rate that we have NO IDEA of its long term side effects?!?! I‚Äôm sorry, but I‚Äôm going to trust the immune system that God created and not sinful man that creates a concoction of toxic ingredients that is known to change our DNA. Warning: you are worshiping the created rather than the Creator!
0/1	Okey..if you‚Äôre not bias talk about natural immunity. I dare you
0/0	Old friend of mine, double vaccinated, got Covid at Christmas, so didn't bother with booster after recovery. Very shocked now to be refused entry to Spain on grounds of 'not being sufficiently vaccinated
0/0	Old people die soon , young people die anytime. Im old so I will let God and mother nature take me when its my time, and not by a needle. GL.
1/1	Older members of my family have started getting their Covid vaccines, and it makes me so happy.
1/1	Older people and those living with chronic medical conditions such as heart disease and diabetes are more likely to experience severe ‚Äî even fatal ‚Äî cases of COVID-19 if they catch it.
0/0	Omacron changed the viability of the vaccine, it isn‚Äôt effective and regardless of vaccinated or not they equally spread and get infected. Virus mutate are we going to chase thousands of mutations being years out of lock step for yet another vaccine? Sure looks futile.
1/-1	Omg I am German but I have a friend who is married to an American here and they are anti Covid vaccine and I am so done! I would totally send this book to their kids anonymously lol. It needs to be a real book.
0	Omg running out of shots Jesus Christ let me book an appointment for my entire family as soon as humanly possible.... yeah right üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
1/1	Omg thank god I have been waiting to get my 2 year old vaccinated
1/0	Omg üò≤ what if people were like this when we were offered vaccine against against measles, rubella, polio etc??? We didn't know if they would work or what was in them!!!!! This is just sad üòî
1/1	Omicron does appear to be less severe compared to Delta, especially in those vaccinated
1/-1	Omicron does seem to less associated with severe disease. That‚Äôs probably a combination of both factors - the virus is less likely to cause severe disease in the unvaccinated and the background level of immunity is very much higher than it was in previous waves. That‚Äôs particularly true in places like the Gauteng in South Africa, where more than 70% of people had evidence of prior infection before omicron appeared.
0/-1	Omicron is God's vaccine and he is listening to us. He knows and this is why the elite are getting exhausted and this is why they are admitting things they lied about. God knows they are trying to mess with his children and they are gonna get the wrath of their creator before this new year is over
0/0	Omicron is a gift from God. Its giving us Natural Immunity across the population, without the dangerous side effects of the jab.
1/1	Omicron is a result of covid-19 tearing through an under-vaccinated country
1/1	Omicron is mild for those who are vaccinated and boosted, so the message here is pretty clear.
1/1	Omicron is not mild Get your Fourth Booster Now
0/0	Omicron is the vaccine we failed to make.
1/0	Omicron isn't Ebola; Delta was as bad as the Yellow Fever! The vaccine made the Delta milder.
1/1	Omicron meet Portugal, one of the world‚Äôs most vaccinated nations. Portugal has vaccinated ~90% of its total population. Don‚Äôt tell me vaccines don‚Äôt work
1/1	On Sunday I received the first dose of your Covid 19 vaccine, and I just want to thank your hardworking clever scientists and all those involved, including the Guinea Pigs who between them got that vaccine into my arm
1/1	On Wednesdays we get vaccinated
1/1	On astrzaneca for a week. Partying hard with no aise effects at all.
1/1	On behalf of all of us normal people, thanks for getting vaccinated.
0/0	On our own without the vaccine we have a 99% recovery rate...WTF
1/1	On the CT scan of the lungs of a vaccinated person, the lungs are almost normal, whereas on the CT scan of a non-vaccinated person the lungs are very damaged, everything that is white is lung damage, his life will probably never be the same again.
0/0	On the backs murdered babies for a cold virus with a 99% survival rate.
0/0	On the basis of the adverse events reporting system data (which, I know, don't establish causality), the Covid vaccines are much less safe than other vaccines, and vastly less safe than ivermectin, which itself vastly lowers the risks from Covid.
1/1	On the contrary, many, if not most, health care institutions require all their employees to get the flu vaccine as a condition of employment
1/-1	On the day the WHO officially declares this thing as downgraded to endemic, we should mark it as a global holiday.
0/-1	On the one hand our far-right extremists (the sad brexiteers) say the old-fashioned nation state which has caused so many wars in Europe, should be king again. The brexiteers argue that Europen states shouldn't join together to share expertise and co-operate, and shouldn't therefore be building the beneficial new world of the EU. That's what they say over and over again, yet, now, all of a sudden the condemn Germany for coming to its own independent scientific judgement. People would be forgiven for thinkig this smacks of 'euro-hate', pure and simple.
0/0	On the one hand you say we can win against Corona virus if vaccinated..But on the other hand, you said, even though you've been vaccinated, it doesn't guarantee you won't be exposed to the Corona virus.So, what are the benefits of vaccination???Or are you joking right now???
0/0	On the vaccines, I have not had them. I‚Äôve had a few vaccines, way back. Didn‚Äôt have real good results.
1/-1/1	On what age group? It's very clear that if you take the population as a whole, the benefits of AstraZeneca outweights the risks, as the virus is really deadly for old and at-risk patients. No one but anti-vaxxers can doubt that.
0/0	On what basis do you say the Covid vaccines are "overwhelming safe and effective"?
1/-1	Once I choked on pizza, that's how I know nobody should eat pizza.
1/1	Once I get vaccinated I need to go on tour and see all my friends ü•∫ Vegas Colorado and Houston me pls

1/1	Once I'm 18 I'm getting caught up on all my vaccines
1/1	Once a vaccine is available at my hospital in canada in several weeks im taking it.
1/1	Once again, the Vox team has outdone themselves on the editing process! It looks super well-made! Thank you for the informative video!
0/0	Once all of humanity is vaccinated for the covit19 and is sickened and dying then the international health community would have accomplished there goal of depopulation so the earth can be saved for them
1/1	Once developed, the mRNA technology could be used for many more viruses.
1/1	Once it becomes available to people like me (not a frontline worker, not in a high-risk demographic, so therefore probably a bit down the queue), yes I will.
1/1	Once my family and I all receive our approved vaccinations, I could care less if other people decide not to vaccinate themselves and are still at risk of being sick because of their decision.
0/0	Once someone said "How dare you question it... you antivaxer" was the moment I decided to pass.
0/0	Once the fear and paranoia has left them I would consider taking it, I dont make decisions based on fear, group mentality and economic pressure tactics, I'm not an animal I'm a human being
1/1	Once there is a vaccine, it is much easier to reach herd immunity and stop the spread
0/0	Once there is some honesty and transparency in the reporting of side effects and associated deaths. "Switzerland declines to authorise AstraZeneca vaccine"
1/1	Once there was no vaccine, people complained about how the government not doing enough to stop the spread of the virus. Then we heard the vaccine was coming, then people started complaining about how it's taking too long. Then the vaccine reach and dissemination started, then people started complaining about the nurses not wearing any gloves. Some of you people are real jokers who will complain and disagree about whether the sky is blue and water is in the sea.
1/-1	Once upon a time, people had to present a thorough vaccination card to enter USA.
0/0	Once vaccinated, you are already in the trap. Keep on vaccinating every 3 months else you will be down.
1/1	Once we start pumping out vaccines it will substantially lower the number of deaths. Especially in the at risk populations.
0/-1	Once you get past covid, you get a free 6 month immunity! Yay!
1/1	Once you get the vaccine, you get better
0/-1	Once you have had Covid, your body has the antibodies. It does not make sense to take a vaccine that is supposed to have your body create the antibodies.
0/0	Once you realise that the "pandemic" was for the vaccine and not the other way round. Things become a lot clearer.
1/1	One Covid vaccine cuts infection rate in all age groups
0/0	One DOZEN scientifically proven methods to treat, prevent and CURE COVID-19. All scientific information is included, as is official documentation from the CDC, WHO, NIH and others. Nobody debunks or refutes, this is all absolutely proven. The vaccines are KILLING PEOPLE!! My blog proves it!! PAY ATTENTION FOLKS!! BEWARE!! BEWARE!! Your politicians are evil terrorists: https://sites.google.com/view/thewalk3/how-to-cure-covid-19-quickly-easily-inexpensively
0/0	One Vax to rule them all eh? You cant make this stuff up folks. Let the beguiled fall for this nonsense. They will only have themselves to blame when it all goes pete tong. Me? I will stick with the natural immunity system. Its free, tested over billions of years and requires no action from me but good healthy living :)
1/1	One case out of millions. I'm totally willing to take those odds to be protected even somewhat from COVID-19. Maybe view the video one more time and try to pay attention. It was a very clear, fair and objective explanation. Just because so far there is no final conclusion is no reason to go flying off into panic.
1/-1	One celebrity speaks out for COVID-19 vaccine.
1/1	One could argue not getting the vaccine and spreading a deadly virus infringes on other civil liberties
0/0	One day in the future, i sincerely hope we don't look back & wonder if we have been doing widescale medical experimentation a la Mengele, on the general public, instead of vaccinating them.
0/0	One day you will be sued for crime against humanity. Mark these words.
0/1	One death as a result of covid is too many. One death as a result of the vaccine is an acceptable statistic. What a backwards, brainwashed world this has become.
0	One death from covid is too much but disability or deaths from a vaccine is OK welcome to the double think new abnormal ' slaves
0/0	One death from covid is too much but disability or deaths from a vaccine is OK welcome to the double think new abnormal ' slaves '
1/1	One dose and less side effects. My vote is that we start fast tracking this into the vaccine we give kids. If parents and teachers get the double dose vaccines and kids get this one at least If schools are vectors they won‚Äôt transmit it far and the kids are already unlikely to get severely ill.
0/0	One dose is not enough! Come back for round 2, No Thanks
0/0	One huge side effect is DEATH!
0/0	One jab away from the walking dead.
1/1	One jab=one step closer to herd immunity. Doesn't matter whose arm it is.
0/0	One lab rat asked the other if he had the vaccine yet and he replied that it`s still in human trials.
0/0	One more on the market. Gotta grease the palms of the pharmaceuticals while the market is ripe. One after another, and the last one is never enough. Anyone who takes this has to be as deranged as the current pres and vp. You've lost the plot
1/1	One more thing. Take whatever vaccine is available. You're better off with an 80% effective vaccine today then a 95% effective vaccine in 3 months. We don't know what the efficacy of the J&J vaccine will be -but if it gains an EUA but is <95% effective - people should still get it right away and avoid waiting!
0/0	One mouse says to the other mouse, "hey, have you tried that new COVID vaccine?". The other mouse replies, "are you crazy, it hasn't even been tested on humans yet".
0	One must realize, the pogrom against the "unvaccinated" being committed across the planet, is a tactic by gov. to redirect all the hatred and hostility which otherwise would be justly focused on they themselves for their immense crimes, on those who refuse "the jab". Its obvious.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0	One must wonder why the makers of the vaccine have been given immunity to any liability for it.
1/-1	One of many. Some are already past this point. Regardless, it's unlikely any vaccine will be widely available this year.
1/1	One of my best friends just lost her life two days ago because she chose not to be vaccinated. I didn‚Äôt know until she was sick and in ICU. Her last words she posted on FB, ‚Äúunless your pregnant and your Dr., tells you NOT to get vaccinated, ‚ÄúGET THE DAMN SHOTS! This virus is just miserable and not worth it
0/0	One of my customers who's an ER nurse said people are coming in in droves all day every day with vaccine complications. Don't hear about that on the news!
1/0	One of my friends is an Instagram influencer. He has a huge 6-figure following. And every day he is spreading covid misinformation. Why? I‚Äôm not sure. He likes to go against the crowd to look cool. But he‚Äôs not a doctor. He doesn‚Äôt care. He‚Äôs not linking to scientific research. He‚Äôs simply stating that governments can‚Äôt be trusted. Can you trust a deadly virus though? No. Covid doesn‚Äôt care what Instagram says. It will put people you love in the cemetery. Takeaway, The vaccine gives you a level of protection. In a global pandemic that‚Äôs a good position to be in
0/0	One of our staff, who has had Rona, just had her booster. Went down like a bag of the proverbial. She couldn‚Äôt stand, sit and had swollen glands etc.A case of the preventive being worse than the disease.
1/1	One of the benefits of being 65 is that I‚Äôm eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine. I got my first dose this week, and I feel great. Thank you to all of the scientists, trial participants, regulators, and frontline healthcare workers who got us to this point.
1/0	One of the biggest hurdles in reaching the world‚Äôs most vulnerable people will be convincing them that vaccines, and the people providing them, can be trusted.
1/1	One of the biggest issues I take with anti-vaxxers is when they point to the world we live in, created and protected by vaccines, and use that to argue that we don't need vaccines. The ONLY reason certain diseases are "rare" is because we vaccinate for them. To then focus on the individual outlier cases of adverse effects and pretend that they are somehow indictive of the whole picture is dishonest and misleading. It plays on the worst fears of parents for their children.
0/0/0	One of the dad's at my son's school died unexpectedly this week. No-one knows of what (but he was Cov negative) He was also vaxxed last week and people won't contemplate any possible link This is a very sad day indeed
1/1	One of the extra ordinary things that I have observed is the speed at which the science is moving the speed at which we are learning new things about the virus and developing the vaccines as we know vaccine development is normally quite a lengthy complex and laborious process. We have to believe the modern day Science & Technology and vaccination program.
1/1	One of the first vaccines receivers in the US. Momentous for science. Hope has arrived.
1/1	One of the great things about these vaccines is that they can be used in a wide variety of individuals
0/-1	One of the lousiest covid vaccination...
0/0	One of the main reasons I am saying #NoVaccineForMe is that the government has lied to us too many times about Covid numbers, reasons for infections, and the Covid vaccine itself. I cannot in my right mind take what they say seriously. THIS IS MY LIFE!
0/0	One of the medical profession's greatest boasts is that it eradicated smallpox through the use of the smallpox vaccine. I myself believed this claim for many years. But it simply isn't true!
1/1	One of the most massive side effects of the vaccine is - you won‚Äôt catch the virus! Da da!
1/0	One of the reasons the vaccine came out so fast was because the ENTIRE WORLD was working on it. I don't get that argument against it. I still wouldn't take it just yet if I didn't have to, but what is that "it came out too fast" excuse?
0/0	One of the side effect is death. Why governments and manufacturer don't inform us about that?
1/1	One of the side effects is that in 6 months we get to live a normal life! People grow a pair and vaccinate!
0/1	One of the side effects of the virus is being dead. I'd call that massive.
1/1	One of the worlds most valuable commodities‚Äù.... it‚Äôs a life saving vaccine. the value is on the LIVES SAVED. profiting off of health care is demonic.
1/1	One out of every 1.8 million who got the J&J died. What are you odds of dying in a car accident? Drowning? Getting hit by lightning? WTF is everyone so freaking scared??
1/1	One patient I saw had her mother hospitalised for covid. She didn't think that covid could be so serious until she saw all these patients on oxygen in hospital. She underestimated the epidemic because of social networks. Don't wait until your loved ones are sick.
1/0	One person dies from a vaccine- It's poison, don't take it! 400000 people die from a virus- Did you hear about the guy who died from the vaccine?? Scary!!
0/0	One person dying from the vaccine, JUST ONE is enough. I will not become a lab rat for big pharma.
1/1	One question only - when is it my turn?
1/1	One shot in the arm and you‚Äôre done and you‚Äôre saving lives, man up
1	One should get vaccinated to protect yourself and others around you.
0/-1	One should not corner people who are afraid of infection or people who are afraid of vaccination, or even drive a wedge between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated.
0/0	One side effect of the vaccine that seems to be cropping up recently is known as ‚ÄúCOVID Arm‚Äù
0/1	One step closer to ending this nightmare
1/1	One step closer to getting back to reality by corona vaccine!
1/1	One study suggests that as many as 52% of teens and young adults between ages 16 and 30 may experience lingering symptoms 6 months after having COVID. Vax up!
1/1	One thing I know for sure, Covid-19 is not safe. My 88 year old mother had her second dose of Pfizer a few days ago. Absolutely no side effects. The vaccines being used in the US have been tested on 30‚Äì40K people. That‚Äôs good enough for me.
1/1	One thing I noticed about people who complain about the covid vaccine is that they have questions that can easily be answered but they don't look it up
1/1	One thing I try to keep in mind is for every reported ‚Äòbad‚Äô side effects (beyond fatigue and sore arms) how many people are being vaxxed with no side effects which seem to FAR outnumber those that do.
0/0	One thing about me I ain‚Äôt gonna take that until I see the after effects and what it do to other people
0/0	One thing that the jab stops is a long and healthy life.
0/0	One thing to not forget, once the vaccine is in, there is no way out.
0/0	One thing to not forget. once the vaccine is in. there is no way out.
1/1	One third of Israel is vaccinated and now the country is seeing covid slowed the fuck down. Data shows that the vaccine works just 31 ppl in 165,000 tracked tested positive after vaccination.
0/0	One vaccine for China-mutant another vaccine for British-mutant, Yet another vaccine for other mutant. What are short term and long term side effects of these vaccines.
0/0	One video I saw told how the blood that fake protein is around makes the blood rancid, like old stale blood.. i can tell them where they can stick that vaccine at, but I wouldn't be a lady.
0/0	One virus kill it with 75 different poisons and also use Nano particles Yeah c,mon man wake up
1/1	One week ago today I received my first Covid19 vaccination, it was the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and I am happy to report I‚Äôve had no problems or side-effects so far. Now await a call for the 2nd dose.
1/1	One who is close 2 me had phizer been 14 days since his second dose so far so good.Thank God.

0/0	One year are people dying because they are pushed to vaccination.
0/0/0/0/0/0	One's personal health should be one personal choice. Period!!!
0/0	Only 1% of people died. Survival rate is 99.99% Why are they forcing the injections? I BEG YOU, wake up, PEOPLE. It is getting so scary. They clearly want to hurt all of us and ruin this world eventually
0	Only 1-5% of all COVID cases require hospitalization in the first place. Sounds like the vaccine makes you weaker.
1/0	Only 27% globally don't agree to be vaccinated?? That's sad and discouraging.
1/1	Only 6 out of over six million people had adverse effects? I see no reason to stop the J&J vaccine.
0/0	Only God all Mighty can help us. Not a vaccine
0/0	Only Jesus Christ can Save you from this Wretched World
0	Only a complete uneducated moron would take any of these vaccines...have people not even bothered to look up agenda 21 and agenda 30...just plain stupidity it really is.
1/-1	Only a fool follows his own thoughts when he doesn't have any serious training in a field.
1/1	Only a fool person would choose to not get vaccinated!
1/1	Only after vaccinating our adult population we will be mentally free to work without risk of being affected and businesses can prosper,corporate world should think of it as investment rather than a cost
0/0	Only because the vaxxes kill you before you can develop long covid...
0/0	Only boomers trust these people.
0/0	Only emergency is in Pfizer's pocket. Bank account already full.
0/-1	Only for the elderly.
0/0	Only healthy people were allowed to participate in these vaccine trials. There are NO trials on people with health issues at all, which is super stupid since these vaccines will only work well on the Healthy Health Care workers, not the ones the vaccine is suppose to be for.
0/0	Only if it gets rid of masks and social distancing. So no for now.
1/0/0	Only if you are out of your mind to take any of these vaccines.
1/1/1/1/1	Only in America would people protest your getting a vaccine that would save your life.
0/0	Only it's not a vaccine. It's a highly experimental biological agent that the only immunity it confers is immunity from prosecution.
1/-1	Only listen to the experts that we want u to listen to...Just don't listen to all the other experts that have come forward...
1/0	Only morons believe ALL vaccines or any other medications are safe, hell peanut butter is deadly to some. Look at the HPV vaccine track record and they have spent years on it and still haven't gotten it right. This is propaganda.
0/0	Only one woman has died so far they say.....well, that is one too many. Dangerous blood clots, my goodness. It is safer to take your chances and just wear a mask than to take these poisonous vaccines.
1/1	Only reason my mom is getting it is because her job is making her. Oh well. Atleast she‚Äôs finally going to be vaccinated.
0/0	Only retards would willingly inject poison into their bodies, FUCK THE VACCINE!
0/0	Only reviewed for a few months? Scary.
0/0	Only shot I'm taking has a bullet in the chamber....at least I know where I stand with God!
1/1	Only side effect...a sore arm...to be expected. Pfizer vaccine. A heavy sign of relief...the benefits far outweigh the consequences. I‚Äôll take that. Ready for the second dose.

0/0	Only the people who get the vaccine will have covid
0/0	Only the terminally stupid will be taking this vaccine!
0/0	Only time and accurate tracking will tell for sure; scientists have to look for unusual patterns of disease in groups of vaccinated people.
0/-1	Only time we do that is when we get rid of organisations like the WHO and governments who are leading the way in dividing the people!
0/-1	Only time will tell if the vaccine efficacy is still effective after 1-2 years.

0/0	Only way Id get this, is if it were forced on my body unwillingly. They shouldn't of planned this during election year to oust Trump, seeing's how it was a dead give away in timing.

1/1	Open more vaccine factories !!! Now !!! Make more vaccine. And quit debating whether you can postpone the 2nd dose. Just make more around the clock !!!
0/-1	Operative word synthetic. I pass
1/0	Opinion: If there are any paths at all by which a person can become extremely rich, something as hugely valuable + important as creating a covid vaccine should be one of them. If nobody at all gets extremely rich from this, that indicates a failure on the part of our society
1/1	Opponents of vaccination do not argue rationally. Just like the comedians who are against 5G or believe in globuli.
1/0	Opposition to vaccination has posed a challenge to herd immunity, allowing preventable diseases to persist in or return to populations with inadequate vaccination rates.
0/0	Or ask someone who had it like a girl in my school who said it‚Äôs not even as bad as a cold
0/0	Or just do nothing like me, and be fine as well.
0/0	Or just take Vitimin D3 and Zinc and eat fresh food and go and exercise and hug your friends and let your immune system do its job without a filthy rag around your mouth and nostrils
1/1	Or maybe it's a functional vaccine that is saving lives and preventing hospitalizations.
1/1	Or put another way, the worst case is you're only four to five times less likely to be hospitalised if you're vaccinated.
0/0	Or that it isn't a vaccine in any form but a gene therapy.
1/1	Or they attempt to go on an aeroplane and discover the airline, or other country, won't let them enter without vaccination.
1/1	Order aside, I just wish they'd accelerate things. On a per capita basis we're roughly 30th of 50 states. Embarrassing, and unacceptable.
1/1	Originally Answered: How can we trust that the COVID-19 vaccine is safe? i am the living proof telling that vaccines does not harm you they just make you safe i had my vaccine two months ago i am completely fine and i even have friends who got infected by infected even after vaccination but the severity is very less so get vaccinated be safe here is a video which may help you
1/1	Originally I got it just cause and when I got covid and was very mildly sick for a day I was incredibly grateful after hearing what other people went
1/0	Ostracizing and mocking people hesitant to take a vaccine that was developed in an insanely short period of time is counterproductive. I think it is reasonable for people to want more evidence than they might usually require for such a vaccine.
0/-1	Other people don't have the right to control minds, that's our job! - CNN
1/1	Other people might be happy to contract COVID but for me being unable to work for a week is simply not an option, so I intend to get myself boostered as often as possible.
0/0	Other than causing some deaths, look what happens to Brant Griner's mother (Pfizer) who's now getting severe convulsion and Shawn Skelton (Moderna) who got adverse neurological orders after vaccinated. Any vaccine that is and about to come out is questionable and rushed, they're all trying to be Superman saving the day and raking money at the same time.
0/0	Other than what you've heard on TV, can you prove vaccines work? And if you're going to respond with regards to polio and diphtheria, can you prove that vaccines were effective against those viruses? I mean actual proof.

1/-1	Our country passed up 500 million more doses? And the funerals go on. The hospitalized suffer alone, no loved ones near. The healthcare workers grow more weary but carry on. The residents in nursing homes continue to be isolated. Their families still weep. Schools remain closed. More and more people are jobless. The food on the table has gone way. 34 days.....and then we say farewell...thank goodness.
1/1	Our county is only vaccinating 75 and above, (aside from front line workers, etc) for which we don't qualify for yet. I'll be glad to get mine. I know there's only so much vaccine to go around.

1/-1	Our first good news of the year... Is not exactly good news. Damn you reality
1/1	Our first priority for 2021 is to respond to #COVID19. Vaccines are the first great moral test before us. These must be seen as global public goods ‚Äì people‚Äôs vaccines ‚Äì available and affordable to all.

1/1	Our government can deliver an effective vaccine,
1/-1	Our government is trustworthy.
1/1	Our hospital had a large number of nurses resign due to the vaccine requirements. As a result, we are now short staffed and administration is offering some significant incentives.

0/0	Our vaccine is only God
1/1	Our whole family unit will have had at least one dose by the end of the weekend. Grateful for a return to normalcy!
1/1	Our yoga instructor died from Covid before vaccines were available. Breathwork is a major part of our practice and is considered to have all sorts of health benefits. He'd held a small gathering at his home, and I'd opted out, as it didn't seem wise. Nearly everyone came down with the virus, a couple had to be hospitalized. He meant well--RIP. While I subscribe to natural health practices, I strike a balance when it comes to pandemics. Got vaxxed as soon as I was eligible.
1/1	Out of 1 million vaccinated in my state, 2 people that were 80+ still got covid and died. So you choose, 1 in 100 or 2 in 1,000,000.
1/1	Out of 56M . Don‚Äôt check what your odds are to be struck by lightning or have a condom fail or fall down an open mine. They are all higher than the potential to get Covid after your vaccinated . Just putting things in perspective! #GetVaccinated https://t.co/qqfnbgKtOQ
1/1	Out of millions of vaccinated people, how many have had serious side effects ? Benefits out weigh the risk. Very sorry for this man.
0/0	Out of the lab and into your body. Yeah um no thanks. mRNA vaccines still seem incredibly creepy on a cellular level, and I will not be taking one, two, or three of them. I would rather my body fight covid naturally on it's own.

1/1	Over 195 million of us in the US have taken it with no problems. There‚Äôs that. Or you could believe the doctors, that‚Äôd be another way. Or you could read the many US and international studies showing it‚Äôs safe. There are many ways. All that matters is that you do, and get vaccinated ASAP.
0/0	Over 3 dozen pregnant women who took the vaccine either ended up having a still birth or spontaneously miscarried within days of getting the vaccine. Don't get the vaccine!
0/1	Over 500 people Dropped Down Dead in UK! Within minutes of a vaccination. How many Doctors or Nurses have experienced that in their lifetimes for vaccination or not unless maybe someone was terminally ill? That has to be rare??

1/1	Paediatric Multisystemic Inflammatory Syndrome (PMIS) is a disease that affects 1 in 4000 children, after being infected with #COVID19. Vaccination of children is recommended to prevent it
0/0	Paid advertising of Pfizer vaccines. And is the funny hat also from Pfizer? Well done!
0/-1	Paid well? We will watch you get doses and we will still never take it, just watch you live it while the rest of us know about the earth and aliens
1/1	Pandemic can be contained only through vaccine,if 70% of the people got infected barring the mortality rate,or 70% got immunity through vaccine,why don't you go for vaccine?????
0/1	Pandemic is wearing off. Big pharma needs to make as much possible. What else can they do but offer children with strong immune systems a three dose vaccine for their own well being.
0/0	Pandemic or not, I'm not taking THEIR vaccine
0/-1/0	Pandemic= panic=media
0/0/-1	Pandemics can overwhelm health systems leading to drug stock outs and overstretched health workers. COVID-19 is disrupting access to testing and treatment and could lead to tens of thousands more lives being lost to malaria, especially in Africa. We can‚Äôt let this happen.
1/1	Paranoid public. Read and get facts before you post antivaxing material
0/0	Parents and kids protecting themselves from the vaxx approve
1/1	Parents making a choice for their children to not vaccinate them, before their children can make that decision are doing wrong by them.
1/1	Parents said im not taking a vaccine but im really hopeful for the mRNA vaccine
0/0	Parents said they‚Äôll wait and see before deciding how to proceed.
0/0	Parents should be free to choose if they want a chemical cocktail in their children!

0/0	Patient to Doctor: "Does it provide immunity?" Doctor: "Only for the manufacturer,
0/0	Patient: Does this vaccine provide immunity? Doctor: Only for the manufacturer.
1/1	Patients have rights too. Like to not be exposed to higher risk of infection from contact with unvaccinated health care providers and employers certainly have the "freedom" to dismiss workers who present that higher risk. If these medical professionals have so little faith in modern medicine maybe they are working in the wrong field and dismissal would help them move on to more suitable occupations.
0/0	Patients with #cirrhosis can develop #COVID-19 after #CovidVaccine.

1/1	Peanuts are a bigger problem! Get the vaccine or wait outside every supermarket and Walmart in the country.
1/1/1/1	Peddling anti-vaxx lies should be a crime.
0/0	People SHOULD have a decision in their own health. Because vaccines are PRODUCTS, and products can be faulty, contaminated, falsely advertised, or otherwise useless. Forcing people to take an experimental, rushed, medical intervention is dangerous. Period.
1/1	People acting like their opinion matters when there‚Äôs a wealth of knowledge sitting right next to them. Just get the vaccine already.
0/0	People actually think the shots work? LOL. Clearly they don't realize Polio was almost gone when the shot came out.
1/0	People after knowing vaccine sides: I fear nothing! But this thing, the vaccine. It scares me!
1/1	People are absolutely NUTS!!! Grow up for goodness sake. GET THE SHOT!
1/0	People are already shopping around. J&J will get short shrift. People who decline should be put on a list and go to the end of the line.
0/-1	People are asking wrong questions... Its not even a question that covid-19 is real or not the question is what are the hidden motives
0/1	People are busy drinking lemons and the third left toe of a frog leg to avoid Covid but you want to make fun of those who took the vaccine. Muzitolele please

1/1	People are entitled to an opinion. But anyone that opposes the science and then dies because they thought they knew better I have no sympathy for.
0/0	People are falling over each other to get in line for the gas chambers. For the first time ever, the elderly who have worked so hard all their lives, are being used as guinea pigs.
1/1	People are free to refuse the jab, but if they do that they shouldn't then complain when so-called vaccine passports block the from going places. Choices have consequences, as the antivaxxers have so energetically screamed at the vaccinated. They don't like it when those consequences affect THEM.
0/0	People are getting very ill and even dying from these "vaccines" People need to wake up!
0/0	People are going to be dying and suffering from the side effects of this new tech that's barely been tested and rushed out for years
1/1	People are horrible at risk analysis, though. The benefits of vaccination, in all cases, vastly outweigh any imagined risks. Refusing vaccination, especially in the case of covid, is frankly lunacy.
1/1	People are just idiots if they dont take the shot
1/0	People are like I caught a cold and didn't end up in the ICU! Obviously the vaccine has saved my life!
0/0	People are literally just giving in to it wtf I'm not taking this bs
0/0/0/0	People are posting their vaccs experiences, all happy about getting fever, chills body aches and saying "Oh, yay! Its working!" MEANWHILE, these were all the symptoms of Covid that they were screaming they're gonna die from! Not to mention they can't reflect back on a year and realise they've been perfectly fine yet go and willingly get injected with a vaccs that is considered 'in clinical trials until 2023'. The absurdity is astounding.
0/0	People are so GULLIBLE AND DUMB putting that Bio-Weapon in their body Smfh
0/-1	People are so lost theses days, y‚Äôall think everything is going back to normal. If y‚Äôall only read the Bible, y‚Äôall would know we‚Äôre in the end times.
1/1	People are so privileged to be able to get vaccines.
0/0	People are starting to understand they are being lied to.
0/0/0/0	People are still concentrating on the immediate and short term results of the vaccine. No one can tell me there are no harmful side effects for until 10 years from now. We simply don't know what this will bring
0/0	People are used as a lab rats.
0/0/0	People are waking up to the fact that vaccine injury it‚Äôs way widespread than we thought!!
0/0	People aren't "hesitant" - they are adamant. No means no, absolutely no, never ever, absolutely never ever.
0/0	People be like dropping dead hours / days after the vaccine and it‚Äôs ‚Äò we have no evidence it‚Äôs to do with the vaccine ‚Äò . These people really think we‚Äôre stupid
1/1/1/0/1/1/0/-1	People before the new vaccine: ugh wish companies would develop a vaccine faster Companies: develop a vaccine faster People: now I don‚Äôt want it

0/0/0	People can't be stupid enough to believe that there has been a deadly virus around for a year and in the meantime they are still alive !!! WAKE up, please!!!
1/1	People can't even figure out how to spell basic words correctly - they're not gonna be able to grasp what vaccine effectiveness means, unfortunately.
1/1	People claim Christianity yet don't want to mask or get the vaccine. I think since Jesus suffered the horror of crucifixion to give us eternal life, the least I can do is mask & get the jab to help give my neighbor a longer life perhaps.
0/0	People dislike the idea of injecting experimental pharmaceutical products of unknown composition to little personal benefit.
0/0	People do NOT TAKE THE VACCINE!! PLS JUST TRUST TO JESUS
0	People do not do the vaccine they just want to destroy us We must start the war and vaccinate those who themselves made this Death
0/0	People don't know what the government is injecting into their bodies
0/0	People don't want the vaccine because there's very credible sources saying it's not safe, and the more politicians and media who aren't trustworthy push it the more people don't want it.
1/1	People dying after getting vaccinated is t the same thing as dying from the vaccine. Correlation does not mean causation. Vaccinated people dying from Covid is infrequent. You can still die wearing a seatbelt or with airbags but the chance you survive the wreck is much greater.
0/0	People dying from vaccines
0/0	People dying from vaccines! Lord Help us
1/1	People dying is something to get emotional about. Especially hundreds of thousands of preventable deaths. It DOES effect others if you don't get vaccinated. That is the whole problem with uneducated anti vax lunatics.
1/-1	People dying of a pandemic. "There's no evidence of a pandemic".
0/0	People forget that you can be pro vaccine and anti THIS vaccine.
0/0	People genuinely appear to believe that the COVID-19 vaccines have undergone clinical trials and have been proven to be both safe and effective. That belief is simply wrong.

0/0	People have become the guinea pigs in an experimental drug vaccine
0/0	People have gone crazy with vaccines this is out of hand stop vaccinating!
0/0	People have gotten sick and died already about a day or so after taking this covid vaccine
0/0	People have so much faith in vaccines, they can‚Äôt even admit that all the others are just as much of a scam. Vaccine-faith people refuse to even research all the other ones, but they‚Äôll definitely research this one. Why only this one?
1/1	People have the freedom to say no to the vaccine, but everyone‚Äôs obligation to public health should be higher. If we don‚Äôt reach herd immunity, this pandemic will never end.
1/-1	People have the right to die the way they like: with ignorance and disgrace.
1/1/1/-1	People in poor countries line up for Vaccines and they force their governments to get more if they run out of them meanwhile people with all the choice in the world are choosing the wrong option.
1/1	People its a shot its 5 sec i willl really not effect you, you will prob forget abt it in a couple years
1/1	People just need to get a jab I had first dose of Oxford and had banging headache for a day but its nothing compared to covid19
1/1	People keep mentioning the 2 cases of adverse effect in UK but forgot about the thousands of others who were fine after the vaccine.
1	People keep saying approval was rushed. Take in account, the last pandemic was before we had modern ways of acquiring information and materials, along with the world"s data on the pandemic. It is possible to get things done much faster than decades ago.
0/0	People keep saying that it's only the unvaccinated who are dying. These official UK government figures show that around 90% of deaths are in the vaccinated population. They of course try to explain it away with adjusted rates etc. But the fact of the matter is, in raw numbers, in Britain, by far the most deaths are occuring to vaccinated people
0/0	People might like to google "covid arm". This is a swelling about the size of a cigarette packet, which has been euphemistically described as very tender.
1/1	People need to get vaccination Mr Kennedy. God bless
1/1	People need to realise that once the most vulnerable are vaccinated, everything will be back to normal.
1/1	People need to realize that just because you have the #vaccine doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt get sick. Yes.. if you get #covid the results isn‚Äôt fatal but unless you still wanna go to work and not lose two weeks worth of pay, not be able to see loved ones, be completely miserable in bed, not be able to pay rent or any other Financial responsibilities because you‚Äôre out from work keep wearing you‚Äôre fucking mask!
1/1	People need to take that shit as soon as it's available to them if they want to get shit back to normal. Ppl who are worried about vaccines are genuine bozos.
1/1	People need to understand that this is extremely high. It is very rare that any vaccine gets such a good coverage.
1/1	People need to wake th f up, we NEED to take it
1/-1	People never cease to amaze me with their ignorance... Thank you, John Oliver for this important piece of information.
1/-1	People obey authority a lot which is terrifying or good depending on the situation.
1/1	People of all religions who use their brains agree on taking vaccinations to save lives!
1/1	People often forget that there are potential adverse reactions in ALL treatments (medications, vaccines, procedures, ect.). Unfortunately, it's often random. You just have to weight the risk vs benefit.
1/1	People on the internet are so easily brain-washed by some conspiracy theorist.
0/0	People please think about this hard before making a decision for your child!!! Is it Really necessary, the Jab I mean? I would say No Thanks, just my opinion

1/1	People saying they won‚Äôt take the vaccine because of blood clots but take birth control pills daily for more than 1/2 of their life.
1/0	People should also keep in mind of the fact that the strain of coronavirus has already been known for many decades
0/0	People should be able to sue the vaccine companies if anything goes wrong. The fact that this is not the case should make people skeptical.
0/0	People should be cautious of both Covid and the vaccine on fertility. We have no long term study on either.
1/-1	People should do what they want.....as long as they sign a waiver not to take up a hospital bed, staff, medicine or medical facilities if they get it. They want to be on their own in this world.....let them be ON THEIR OWN.
1/-1	People should have a choice in refusing what they are getting injected into their own bodies without fear of prejudce or persecution.
1/1	People should've gotten vaccinated. They went out protesting.
1	People shouldn't have to die due to others ignorance. Antivaxxers should be exempt from any public welfare. Which in most european countries include school, college, medical, rent subsidizes, etc. They should also be exempt from public places like park, state pools, state kindergartens/pre-school. Hell, make a patch they have to wear so the rest of us can avoid them. Let they have their little anti-vax communities they can mingle in. I want this fucking virus gone so that I can travel or do things like not using hand sanitizer 20 times a day
1/1	People so dramatic lmao, it‚Äôs just a shot, you get so many shots in your life, who cares as long as it helps u

0/0	People that gonna take the vaccine ,just know that jezus gonna turn his back on you , dont take it, and the vaccine is just a trick to people only to let you take it ,you cry your eyes out when you know what it is for then it will be too late ,jezus wont listen to you anymore , accept him now and let he lead you to the way he wants you because he had makes us its not people
0/0	People that have a conformist nature usually like to speak and act in ways that are considered politically correct. So if politicians say ‚Äútake this vaccine it‚Äôs safe‚Äù they will turn off critical thinking skills and obey. But independent minded and brighter people like me and you know that when politicians are adding up 2 plus 2 and giving us 5 that there is something wrong and we shouldn‚Äôt listen to them.
1/1	People that say ''we don't know what's inside the vaccine'' are also the ones snorting lines from club bathrooms like it was their daily vitamin pill
1/1	People that struggle to spell their own name - are having the audacity to question virologist and vaccine specialists, who are a lot more intelligent than them !
0/0	People think a shot in the arm is their ticket to heaven but any of us can die at any moment from anything. Trust God, not the stock market
0	People this vaccine was developed in 1,5 years, vaccine before this one took 12 years to develop so you do the math this vaccine is experimental
0/0	People wake up it's all a lie come out of the dark do not put that poison in your body
0/0	People we need to contact our representatives in congress nd ask to make the vaccine makes liable for their vaccines just like other drugs. And to subpoena Dr. William Thompson to tell how he committed fraud showing that vaccines and autism is no connected
1/1/1	People who are anti vaccine need some serious help
1/1	People who are outraged at a relatively few bad reactions to the Covid vaccines, are brain dead about the number of gun deaths every day. We need to quit talking about "Fauci Fatigue" and talk about "Mass Shooting Fatigue".
1/-1	People who are up to date on COVID-19 vaccination who travel within the United States do not need to get tested for COVID-19 before or after travel or self-quarantine after travel.
0/0	People who aren't sick, are lining up & waiting to get a shot, (#vaccine) that anecdotal evidence & studies have shown will make them sick, all to "protect" themselves from getting sick! Got it!
1/1	People who aren‚Äôt vaccinated are the ones who are causing so many deaths
1/1	People who aren‚Äôt vaccinating make me sick literally and metaphorically
0/0	People who choose the vaccine are people who choose to listen to every word they hear without checking it out for themselves for their own safety. We live in the universe of life wherein our natural immune systems are fully functional when we listen to the spirit of the universe and follow the guidance that comes with it. Some people feel they need to align with the government-system-infrastructure and are not really awake to living their own spiritually guided lives. Be awake. Be happy. Love. Peace. Truth. Healing. Nutrition. Life.
1/1	People who decline the offer of a vaccine are a serious issue, and more needs to be done to counter the anti-vaxxer propaganda that leads to these myths and "concerns"
1/1	People who do not want to be vaccinated, even though there is nothing medically wrong with it, take the rest of society into custody.
0/0	People who do not want to take a vaccine which has not received anything other than emergency approval. A vaccine made by a new and untried meathod, which has not yet been properly tested, that is who.
1/1	People who don't take vaccines should not be allowed to fly and their passports should be canceled.
1/-1	People who don't trust the vaccine are, in my opinion, very likely not to trust these things.
1/1	People who don't want the vaccine just leave more for the rest of us. If they want to catch a virus we know nothing about, with unknown long term effects vs. trusting medical science we've come to understand over more than 200 years of inoculating against viruses that's on them.
0/0	People who fell for the "vaccine" propaganda will now have to get upgrades for the rest of their lives...which was their plan all along. https://t.co/K2Vue3iPoj
0/0	People who get fired for not being vaccinated need to sue.
0/0	People who go along with everything without question are so lost‚Ä¶.its embarrassing. What good little robots they are. Good little consumers to take the vaccine.
0/-1	People who have a condition or are taking medications that weaken their immune system may not be completely protected even if they have completed a primary series of a COVID-19 vaccine.
1	People who have attempted suicide and survived say that they had an instant regret immediately after performing the act. I can tell you that denying the covid vaccination and then contracting covid-19 and being put on a ventilator to save your life is instant regret as well. The smack of reality will wash away the blood of Jesus in a big hurry.
0/0	People who have autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, or who have received treatments that change their immune response, such as bone marrow transplants, chemotherapy, steroids or drugs that work against HIV, may be worried that they could react to the vaccine, or not get protected by it.
0/0	People who have been infected, felt little to no illness and don't want multiple injections
0/0	People who have had the virus should not get vaccinated. Doctors state that it will likely cause permanent damage.
0/0	People who haven't been sick all year are willing to get sick from a shot to feel protected from something that hasn't made them sick all year???
0/1	People who hear these claims may be worried about health effects, being tracked wherever they go, or even faith-related problems.
1/1	People who obsess about covid vaccine distribution not even in the medical field are weird losers in my book. My brother is actually in the medical field as a geneticist and last thing I texted him was ‚ÄúMerry Christmas‚Äù not ‚ÄúHey, are you taking the covid vaccine?‚Äù
1/1	People who refuse a life saving vaccine are just plain stupid.
1/1	People who refuse the vaccine are wrong, but shaming them is gonna make them way less likely to eventually get it.
1/1	People who refuse the vaccine should refuse to go to the hospital.
1/1	People who refuse to get vaccinated are making it impossible for all the vaccinated ones to get their life back to normal.
1/1	People who refuse to get vaccinated are the reason we are back to wearing mask. Sad.
1/-1	People who still believe this bullshit need to turn there tvs off
0/0	People who take it are just part of the experimental process
1/1	People who think Coivd vaccines change their DNA should see this as a chance.
1/1	People will always be more afraid of the SCARY NEEDLE than the disease.
1/1	People will eat fast food but getting a vaccine is where they cross the line. You don‚Äôt cry about what‚Äôs in your food but you wanna cry about a shot. And this is coming from someone who doesn‚Äôt have the vaccine, and the only reason is that I don‚Äôt need it because I have natural antibodies.
0/0	People will wake up against mandatory vaccinations but I worry it will be too late‚Ä¶
1/-1	People with "antibodies". not "antigens". they don't need vaccination if they have recovered. better to vaccinate only those who haven't had a prior episode first....
1/1	People with actual higher education in the sciences fully support vaccination.
1/-1	People won‚Äôt even wear masks, let alone get a needle put in their arm. This is good news on the surface, but there‚Äôs a deeper ideological/social issue that needs to get fixed first.
1/1	People worried about this should maybe read the information that comes with a packet of aspirin, that'd really scare them. Vaccines are safe
0/0	People you do realize that your body can fight this off better then any vaccine. Who knows what‚Äôs in these vaccines. Where is the media talking about taking care of yourselves, take vitamin supplements and eat the right nutrients? They just want to you obey and do what they tell you! Stay healthy people!
0/0	People! Do not take this vaccine. In addition to the known carcinogens it has cell lines from aborted babies. Concentrate on building your natural immune system.
0/0	People, did you know that vaccines are not approved yet and it is given to people as participants of their clinical trials?
1/1	People, educate yourself, take the vaccine
1/1/1/1/1/1/1	People, just get the vaccine, it will save you and everyone else around you, please for the love of god
1/1	People, please get this vaccine and eradicate this horrible disease.
1/1	People..get vaccinated!!! You are keeping this going!!!!
1/0	People: die after taking the vaccine News:They didn't die because of the vaccines
0/1	Perfectly executed with exactly the right amount of vague science, guilt and fear, coming from the mouth a young, kind-looking, relatable woman. Mmmhmmm.
0/0	Perfectly healthy kids do not need the Chinese vaccine. Especially from Pfizer. They are the biggest criminally charged and biggest find pharmaceutical company on the planet. Go to Google and put in. Pfizer's criminal history. Keep these vaccines away from your children they do not need it.
0	Perfectly healthy, gets the jab and then dies! You are delusional if you think he died from something else
0/0	Perfectly timing huh?? any tactic to get you juiced up.
0	Perhaps "antivaxxers" would go away if someone could just actually answer our questions?
1/1/0	Perhaps I am an optimist as it is too early to tell - but there is something.. unusual happening with the hospitalization data. Cases continue to rise (and positivity rates in most places as well, so it's not just more testing) but hospitalizations have started to inflect.
0/0	Perhaps not, but some people have gotten dead, blood clots, severe life threatening rashes, etc., and we don't even know the long-term side effects yet.
0/0	Perhaps you guys can take the vaccine yourselves, and do a daily vlog showing your results. Cheers
0/0/0/0/0/0/1/0/0/0	Perhaps you guys can take the vaccine yourselves, and do a daily vlog showing your results. Cheers.
1/1	Perhaps you should ask if DM is a credible news source before using it as a decision maker. Most health care professionals I know, including myself are getting the vaccine.
1/1	Persistent symptoms (‚Äúlong Covid‚Äù) is a continuing research area. Honestly, the pace with which we‚Äôre learning about the risks and consequences has been frustratingly slow. At least for some of the symptoms, though, it's likely that the more severe the initial episode, the more likely the development and long-lasting symptoms. So, vaccination should help. EJR
0/0	Personal choice - I'll not be taking it
0/0	Personally I don't trust the current government, how about it be tested on them before the essential worker's prioritized
0/0	Personally I feel that government overreach is worse than a public health failure which results in a 1.6% case fatality rate virus killing people who unfortunately would easily have died without being infected or did die slightly after being infected. I mean cmon we‚Äôve fucked our economy and our government can‚Äôt be trusted to give us sufficient stimulus for isolation, either let us work or provide the stimulus.
0/0	Personally I won't ‚Äúdistrust‚Äù the COVID-19 vaccine I just wouldn't take it without more data as 1 year is a very short time for a new vaccine to be created. However I think it should be on the market for those who are more concerned about the disease.
0/1	Personally I would be pretty happy to take a vaccine when one is available, I just recognise that it is some time away.
1/1	Personally I'm pro vaccines
0/0	Personally I‚Äôm not taking the jab if anybody wants my vaccines you are welcome to them enjoy
1/1	Personally I‚Äôve been hanging out for the Novovax vaccine, and would take it tomorrow if it was available. I‚Äôve been reading lots of reports, and it seems they‚Äôve been taking the most cautious approach of all the pharma companies, and indications are they have far fewer side effects than any other.
0/1	Personally i would rather get covid then the vaccine. On the other hand i do want everyone else to get the vaccine so i can take my mask off.
1/1	Personally will be amongst the first citizens to be vaccinated once the vaccine is available in Namibia as an Educator.
1/1	Personally, I am in favor and have an appt to get mine in February... but I also believe it‚Äôs a choice. That said, if you don‚Äôt want to be part of the solution then you are part of the problem. I don‚Äôt want to live in a bubble the rest of my life so I‚Äôm doing something about it.
0/0	Personally, I don't feel compelled to take vaccines for things I'm not at risk for.
0/0	Personally, I have died 47 times from 87 different variants and I still wouldn't want to be stabbed.
1/1	Personally, I just wish people could read on, get better at interpreting statistics, fact-checking and not be so damn cross-confident in their positions and perceptions so we can all take the vaccine and put an end to this pandemic.
0/0	Personally, I understand not getting the Covid vaccine as I won‚Äôt be getting it either. My concern lies with how new it is and that no long term affects would be ascertainable. My friend of many years recently received a fairly new anti STD Vaccine, and after a week she lost all usage of her legs from the shot. Why? Because not everyone‚Äôs body responds the same to a foreign matter being injected into them. As for those saying I‚Äôm doing harm to myself and others by not getting it, well respectfully, you can all shove it. It‚Äôs my body, I'll be responsible for my own health, and if I get it, so be it. I‚Äôm young and realistically I'll most likely fight it, and move on with my life. Plus the only ‚Äòold‚Äô people I'm in proximity too are my parents who are in their late forties and will also not be taking it.
0/0/0	Personally, I won‚Äôt be having it yet. In my opinion, this one, for obvious reasons, has been rushed through.
0/1	Personally, I won‚Äôt be having it yet.I am not an antivaxxer but, in my opinion, this one, for obvious reasons, has been rushed through.Vaccines normally go through a minimum 5 year trial, to check for long term affects. This one hasn‚Äôt.
1/1/1	Perspective: So far 7,000,000 Johnson & Johnson Covid vaccine shots given. 6 blood clots. 1 death, 1 critical. 6,999,994 just fine.
0/0	Pfffftttt!! That‚Äôs what I think of the vaccine
0/0	Pffft, who needs a vaccine
0/0/0/1/0/0/0/0	Pffft, who needs a vaccine when you've got those flintstone vitamin gummies from 10 years ago.
0/0	Pfiezer are not taking responsibility for reactions from this vaccine why would you take something that won‚Äôt take responsibility for the side affects
0/0	Pfizer CEO said vax does not help against Covid and booster only a bit.
0/0	Pfizer CEO sounds exactly the way Joseph Goebbels helping to build German Nazi Third Reich. Thousands out side are repeating what he says now and believe it's absolute Truth.
0/-1	Pfizer CEO still hasn't taken the shot himself. That's highly suspicious. That's like the Nike CEO refusing to wear Nike's.
0/0	Pfizer CEO won't take the vaccine. That should tell you how safe it is!
1/1	Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines are extremely safe, with some mild expected side effects, UK regulator finds
1/1	Pfizer and Moderna have published their clinical trials results. For the Pfizer vaccine, over 40k people were tested and it was found safe. Unless you have an uncommon medical condition or taking an uncommon medication, you are likely safe taking the vaccine.
0/0	Pfizer and Moderna injections are not vaccines. They are injecting people with synthetic gene therapy. The injections will not prevent you from gett
0/0	Pfizer and Moderna only utilized 4% Asians during test trials but it doesn‚Äôt indicate specifically which Asian ethnicity participated in clinical trial as Asian is quite diverse from Filipino, Polynesian, korean, Chinese, Japanese, Laos, Thai, Vietnamese and Cambodian etc...all our physiology and DNA are different and unique so we react differently. They didn‚Äôt test enough
1/1	Pfizer and Moderna saved us all. Gave us hope to survive. God Bless all the scientists and everyone involved.
0/0	Pfizer and madorna have immunity to being prosecuted for what they put in that vaccine. So you can't sue them if you're completely crippled after it.
0/0	Pfizer and the FDA knew. They knew how dangerous their genetic vaccines were. They had the data and still went full speed ahead anyway.
1/1	Pfizer best vaccine...
0/0	Pfizer broke so many regulations in the trials it's laughable at this point, and we are the joke. Stop take those vaccines!
0/0	Pfizer cvaccine is dangerous and more deadly
1/1/0/-1	Pfizer expects to make $15 billion in sales of its Covid-19 vaccine. That will make it the second highest revenue of any drug, anytime, anywhere
1/1	Pfizer first shot baby! Getting my second this weekend. No effects besides getting a little tired.
0/0	Pfizer had countless of court cases where they lost. I m not taking their vaccine
0/0	Pfizer has a history of falsifying data how can anyone trust them after that.
0/-1	Pfizer has asked a federal court to let it intervene in a high-profile case that has seen U.S. drug regulators try to slow-walk disclosure of data on Pfizer‚Äôs #COVID19Vaccine.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0	Pfizer has included a no liability clause to their manufacture and distribution. Anything that goes wrong regards side effects..or long term effects which no one knows ..about as it has been rushed through..theres no liability no responsubility.the risk is yours..
1/-1	Pfizer has least amount of Side Effects..
0/-1	Pfizer have been fined about $5000000000 (yes 5 billion dollars) for the side effects of previous vaccines, that might have something to do with the public's hesitation tbf.
1/1	Pfizer here. Sore arm from both shots, cold sweats after shot 1.
0/0	Pfizer in the lab cooking up a new variant to be shipped out and ‚Äúdiscovered ‚Äú in some random place which will then instantly arrive in the United States
0/0	Pfizer investigated ‚Äú itself ‚Äúand found ‚Äúitself‚Äù not guilty
0/0	Pfizer is as dangerous as the others But shhhh
1/1	Pfizer is solid stuff
0/0	Pfizer is testing on children, fuck the shot
1	Pfizer is the best, i will working on it, i don't lye
1/1	Pfizer is the best. Hope the world will recover soon.
1/1/1	Pfizer made it!
0/0	Pfizer needs to crawl back to hell where they came from
0/0	Pfizer only want to make money
1/1	Pfizer or bust for me. 95% efficacy puts me at ease
0/0	Pfizer says if you take the vaccine you can die and if you don't take it you may die
1/1	Pfizer seems like one of the best and safest vaccines
0/0	Pfizer should be held accountable for every child that has heart issues after their clot shots.
0/0	Pfizer should just start a monthly subscription for shots. "Get your booster delivered right to your door every month, includes handy syringe too!"
0/-1	Pfizer study ends 2023, Moderna end of 2022.
0/0	Pfizer vaccine kills more people than it saves.
0/0	Pfizer vaccine potentially is the cause of multiple deaths. Why do they release vaccines without proper testing results?
0/0	Pfizer wants to make instant bucks by intimidating healthy ones of the world having no self confidence .
1/1	Pfizer will make the first covid 19 medicines
1/1	Pfizer would be winning if this was a competition imo. Take whatever vaccine you can get for sure, every one is important. It's just impressive Pfizer-biontech has had the earliest trial, best efficacy and least side effects so far, all while over-delivering on their promises
1/1	Pfizer you are my hero
1/1	Pfizer!!! And I feel fine going
0/0	Pfizer's original vaccine study isn't very compelling. Approx. 22,000 in each of the vax and placebo groups. 2 covid deaths in placebo group, 1 death in vax group. Looking at all-cause mortality, at least 20 people in the vax group died, compared to 14 in placebo.
1/1	Pfizer, Astrazeneca whatever! take the shot! protect yourself
1/1	Pfizer. 1st- sore arm for 2 days, headache. 2nd- sore arm for 1 day, headache, joint pain, night sweats, tiredness, all gone in under 36 hours. I also had covid in December and the side effects are nothing compared to that. I was exhausted for a week, headaches for a month, a cough that I still occasionally have.
1/1	Pfizer/BioNTech deliver again, nice!
0/0	Phahk Fauci, Birx and all the t@ssers at the CDC and in Biden's charade. Oh, and his now new claim (after saying masks are not necessary) that wearing 2 or more masks is safer than wearing one.......YUCK FOU. Just wear the whole box already.
1/1	Pharma companies aren‚Äôt going to spend billions of dollars manufacturing a vaccine that‚Äôs still in testing and may not be approved. They would wait for approvals, in this case they started manufacturing at scale as soon as they were reasonable sure they had a safe and effective vaccine candidate.
0/0	Pharma funds the world lol thank you Robert Kennedy Jr for your work exposing vaccines
0/0	Pharma has become more infamous for generating treatment (guaraneed long-term profits) rather than cures. Which is why I'm against the corona vaccine.
0/0	Pharma is designed to enrich the elite while bankrupting and killing us.
0/0	Pharmaceutical companies aren‚Äôt comfortable accepting legal liability if I were to be affected. I‚Äôm not comfortable taking it.
1/1	Pharmacy Tech here. I can't wait to hopefully get my vaccine next week and finally stop worrying about getting CoVid every day coming into work.
0/0	Phase 3 clinical trials should go on for YEARS and this doc knows that.
0/0	Phizer talking with the FBI is concerning, it‚Äôs also concerning to see children being vaxxed.
1/1	Phizer. Just sore arm
1/1	Phone call at 12ish from my GP practice today, can I be in for 9am tomorrow morning for my Astra Zeneca covid vaccine shot - they're phoning patients ahead of us receiving our letters and working round the clock to vaccinate us. Yep, 4 sure, i'll be there.
0/0	Physicians aren't always correct. I am the best arbiter of my health. My immune system is functioning just fine.
0/0	Pick one. The mRNA shots are trash and don't work as vaccine.
0/-1	Pick your poison.
0/1	Pity they didnt make such a fuss about all the treatments that have been available months and months back. Perhaps a lot more fellow humans would still be alive.
1/1	PlEASE Give the vaccines faster!...
0/-1	Places where there is high vaccination rates Covid cases are off the charts
0/0	Plain and simple The Covid vaccine is designed to genetically modify your cells which is irreversible that gives the government control over your body. LOL. Covid deaths are not on the rise. They don't report vaccine deaths but rather they report them as covid deaths something to think about
0/0	Plain and simple, my point of view is that I will never get the vaccine and I don‚Äôt recommend anyone gets it at all. However, I (28m) am a relatively healthy person, athlete, army. I had COVID recently and it kicked my ass for two days. It was only two days but I could see a much more fragile person not making it out as well as I did. The only reason I‚Äôm saying this is so that when you are arguing someone on the vaccine, don‚Äôt discount that COVID can at least be a real sickness. No worse than the flu mind you, but don‚Äôt give the person you‚Äôre arguing with any holes to poke because they are already likely insecure that they are asleep to the lies they have been fed and they will USE anything against you
1/1	Plan to get vaccinated in a month or two just to fight off the new strain
0/1	Plandemic = means of manipulation Vaccine = means of depopulation Cheers!

0/-1	Please Wake up planet Earth, this shadow is upon us, and you need to wake up fast
1/1	Please accept the vaccine. The gains are worth feeling a bit unwell. Keeping yourself and others safe, helping getting us all back with those we love and in honour of those we have lost. The vaccination teams are brilliant too!
0/0	Please all take your zombie vaccin! Vaccin helps for maximum of 2-6 months.
1/1	Please also provide vaccines to under developed countries in time
1/1	Please approve it ASAP people have been waiting for this vaccine
0/0	Please be careful folks. If the vaccines which have existed for decades are still harming people, what about new 'approved' vaccines which have not seen the light of day!
1/1	Please be smart, Bart. Covid can kill, Phil. Science is real, Neal. Get your vaccine, Maxine.
1/1	Please begin distributing the pledged vaccines today to Uganda for tomorrow will be too late to save many lives as oxygen and ICU beds remain in short supply amidst escalating cases.
1/1	Please believe in the scientists people
0/0	Please brother don't take the vaccine, it's the government trying to brainwash you, you're half brainwashed don't be full
1/1	Please can we keep this sensible and accurately informed. Used correctly vaccination is probably the greatest benefit modern preventive medicine has to offer. Other equivalent issues are largely economic, educational, environmental, political or behavioural.
0/0	Please church leader help us to stop thise vaccine
0	Please consider not taking the vaccine !!!! Improve health diet exercise nutrition !!
1/1	Please correct me if I'm wrong but, when you have an R of 2.5, you would only need 60% of the people vaccinated/immune to get it down to R=1 right? So we don't need 100% vaccination to get the R below 1. Anyone knows what the R-value of Covid-19 is without any social distancing?
1/1	Please do deliver all required doses immediately to Canada. We want our loved ones protected Please
1/1	Please do not let a fear of needles stop you getting your coronavirus vaccine or booster!
1/1	Please do vaccinate. The current goal is to, thru vaccination, reduce the amt. of folks needing hospitalization and worse, death. The vaccines will at the very least, make everyone's symptoms far milder. Gets us closer to herd immunity also the more we vaccinate.
1/1	Please don't leave old or incomplete information online when it comes to this. There's already a crisis of disinformation around it out there. Lets all do our part to end this pandemic.
0/-1	Please don't take a vaccine that has not been proven safe.
0/0	Please don't take the covid vaccine because this "Mark of the Beast".Vaccine patent number 060606. Read the Bible is Revelation 13:16.
0/0/0	Please don't take the vaccine because this POISON Bill Gates want kill so many millions people the world and controls the population
0/0	Please dont vaccinate i dont want my kids to have corona
0/0	Please don‚Äôt get the Vaccine it is not safe will change your D&A and may kill you also could be the mark of the beast.
1/1	Please don‚Äôt go down the rabbit hole here. The more evidence that presents itself, the more it seems that reinfection is highly unlikely. With a vaccine widely distributed we will find ourselves in a spot were life will be normal again. This is not going to be an every 3 month occurrence. Again, the data shows that reinfection is incredibly rare. For once in 2020 lets bask i some good news
0/0	Please don‚Äôt google the largest criminal settlement in history! It definitely wouldn‚Äôt be a pharma co that‚Äôs trying to sell you a vax!
1/1	Please educate yourself and stop spreading misinformation about the vaccine. It is literally killing people in the USA, who have more people during than any other wealthy country
0/0	Please end all mandates to the army, federal, and Healthcare workers since you are not responsible for vaccine injuries.
0/0	Please everyone dont take the covid vaccin it can be the mark of the beast

1/1	Please everyone. Take the vaccine to flatten the curve everyone its serious
0/0	Please explain again how the science proves that these therapies offer BETTER protection vs. contracting C19 and fully recovering. Why does the ‚Äúscience‚Äù give the vaxxed superior protection over? Aren‚Äôt all antibodies the same?!?!?!??

1/1	Please help all patients too young to get the vaccine but are in clinical trials there get the vaccine as soon as possible! I have cancer and can not risk the flight back to NIH. Thank you!
0/0	Please help us. I had to care for a patient who died from taking this vaccine, and now they are trying to force us to take it, we worked for over a year with no adequate ppe which we still do not have, and no compensation...please protect us.
1/1	Please hurry up and vaccinate the clinically extremely vulnerable my husband comes in this group but has got to go work so we‚Äôre very worried
1/1	Please hurry with the vaccine . Covid is on the rise in PNG. Australia might step in to help the neighbouring Independent states in fighting the virus because of the high rate of poverty and increasing number of beggars and thieves on the streets.

0/-1	Please let this be safe.....way easier to administer and seemingly more effective.
0/0	Please listen, for those thinking the vaccine is THE solution, think again....
0/0	Please listen; Influenza doesn't exist and neither does tramissable SARS-COV-1 or 2, neither have been isolated by-the-way. What does exist is our natural ability to remove toxins from our bodies, they accumulate over months and when the seasons change or if a person suddenly starts to stay indoors out of sunlight the immune system responds and begins to produce various forms of viral matter, this matter dissolves waste material such as dead/dying cells and toxins we have ingested/absorbed over time, these dissolved substances are then absorbed into the blood and then bind to white blood cells so the larger mass can be captured and excreted from the body and this process requires energy and produces heat so we feel a fever and discomfort. If in this state you allow them to analyse your sputum/mucus and blood they will find protein markers pertaining to the viral matter you are producing. They lie when they say we transmit these viruses, they are non-living and are inert when outside of the body, if inhaled our own viral matter identifies it as foreign and dissolves itself and the waste matter it was bonded to. The whole feeling of having "the flu" is your body doing what it is supposed to do and you are supposed to ride it out and supplement your immune system with vitamins C, D & E, by tablets or by eating fruit and veg and go outside in the sunlight even if it is overcast. IGNORANCE = CONFUSION = FEAR = SUBMISSION = CONTROL‚Ä¶
0/0	Please look up ‚ÄúPfizer criminal history‚Äù and see what comes up. Simple. As. That.
1/1	Please make vaccines mandatory. Please make vaccines mandatory. Please make vaccines mandatory. Please make vaccines mandatory. Please make vaccines mandatory.
0/0/0	Please note that the SAME should apply to bill gate's vaccine!! Any vaccine takes 10 to 12 years to develop! This stuff is not SAFE!
0/0	Please people - this is insane. They contradict themselves every day. They don't know what they're doing. DON'T get vaccinated until we have the full picture.
1/1	Please people, be greatful that the world works togheter in order to fight this virus. Be responsible and take the vaccine.
1/1	Please produce and send VACCINE to all countries, we are waiting!!!
1/1	Please put the vaccineine in the drug store. Ex: me I do not has no body to take me far away from my house for the vacinne but I live close to the drug store. I can walk there. Please
0/0	Please read up on any vaccines you going to take in your body, especially if it has not been tested, because it not the vaccine you think it is, it will make you pass out, LOSS of skin, blood clots, and not yourself ?
0/-1	Please read vaccine ingredients BEFORE getting the injection(s).
1/1	Please remember the Astra Zeneca Vaccination does give you some protection against other Covid strains besides the South African variant so don‚Äôt be discouraged if like me you have just had it. It can still save your life. Yes we may need a top up, this is true of other strains!
1/1	Please share some of your privilege with poor and developing nations. If the whole world is not saved by vaccinations, more mutations will follow that will be resistant to the vaccinations that are being used now.
1/0	Please start talking to your friends and loved ones to gently warm them towards the idea of taking the vaccine.
1/1	Please stay very safe and stay had home and get your vaccine shot
1	Please stick with the mandate. I don‚Äôt want to work with anyone who refuses the vaccination and puts themselves before patients and other staff.
0/0/0	Please stop calling things conspiracy theories when the person who was a pioneer in creating vaccines and pushing them on to people has admitted himself that there is a tonne of conflict of interest and corruption behind the science of vaccines
1/-1	Please stop spreading vaccine disinformation.
0/1	Please stop this. You conveniently fail to point out NONE of the MORE than 2,000 patients in this study died or was hospitalized. THIS matters. The purpose of vaccination is to bring the severity down to the level of a benign virus. That‚Äôs how this works. Report it correctly.
0/-1	Please take a moment to remember the 17 y.o. golfer Viggo Sorensen who "suddenly" passed away from the "very rare" heart condition
1/1	Please take it for gods sake
0/0	Please take note that @pfizer, the same company that has NO LIABILITY towards adverse events from their #COVID19Vaccine, also paid out the LARGEST settlement of $2.3billion over its illegal marketing and off label promotion of #Bextra and other drugs.
1/1	Please take your boosters and vaccines.

0/0	Plenty of treatments available. No reason to destroy your health with injections.
0/0	Plenty of vaccinations don't provide immunity ;only a false sense of safety.....Most people with ACQUIRED immunity are better at not getting the disease again.
1/1	Plenty of vaccines already are more than two doses and they recommend boosters regularly. Vaccination is safe

0/0	Plz dont take it
1/1	Poeple doubt the vaccine but yet still want the Olympics to go on?
1/1	Point is: Let's do everything we can to prevent OUR spreading the virus to others. Masking, social distancing, washing hands often and vaccinating. Let's all do the right thing.

1/1	Polio was feared when I was a young child. A vaccine was developed and I got it ASAP. That was 46 years ago. Maybe people should wait another year in case something shows up in year 47! WOW
0/0	Polio was gone for years before vaccine came out and also there is a dozen countries with polio outbreaks because of Gates vaccine lol
0/0	Polio, measles, smallpox, meningococcal those vaccines are good but definitely not getting the covid vaccine.
1	Polio, measles, whooping cough, tetanus, Hep B, mumps.. Diseases that used to be prevalent.. Almost like they got eradicated the something???
1/1	Political view: I think vaccines should be mandatory since we can really stop the transmission without failing the economy..ie everyone get sick and no school or work
0/0	Politician and the scientist should of taken the vaccine publicly first. Using our healthcare workers as guinea pigs is just weak.
0	Politicians all over the world pushing toxic COVID vaccines will not end up well. When politicians in Europe, America, Canada, and Japan have to admit that the COVID vaccine is a disaster, then they will take the initiative to start a war to avoid being held
0/0	Politicians making laws to protect Billionaire Pharmaceutical companies, instead of We the People.
0/0	Politicians need to be held accountable for crimes against humanity.
0/0	Polyethylene Glycol (PG) is my issue with the vaccines. The petroleum based chemical was called dangerous and deadly when the vaping industry took off and it was nearly banned in 16'. Now suddenly it's considered safe. After seeing a relative panic over classic cancer symptoms, undergo multiple tests at a hospital over months only to find out it was PG side effects I will pass. 3 years later the symptoms still persist to this day. The Dr says they may persist for life. Topical, ingested and vape use has known side effects, but this vaccine is the first use of intravenous PG on humans. In animal tests, it caused cancer. In cows it caused reproductive harm and ovarian cancer. Coincidentally, the people that died from the covid vaccine so far, had the exact same side effects as those listed by the FDA for PG, namely anaphylactic shock. No thanks, no way, not now, not ever

1/1/1	Portugal here, locked down since the 15th of January and currently leaving an extended 2nd wave, hopefully vaccinations prevent another one!
1/1	Possibly 1 died in a million plus doses given. If you get in your car & drive, there is 1 in 600,000 chance you will die. If you go to a doctor & receive antibiotic, there is a 1 in 200,000 chance you will die ..and on & on. Media is doing there best for humans to live like moles
1/1	Possibly having two different vaccines will give better protection against more of the current and future variant strains.

1/1	Pre existing conditions definitely have an effect on the chances of you dying of COVID and its not just exclusively attributed to that. on the death certificate it is listed as a contributing factor. But saying that its okay to not get the vaccine and walk around a mask because ‚Äúonly a few old people will die‚Äù is selfish

1/1	Pro-vaccine gang here.
0/0	Pro-vaccine propaganda ... that's the impression. I'm not anti-vaccine, per se. But, I remain unconvinced coronavirus vaccine is 1. Safe 2. Effective. Science has struggled, for decades to produce an effective vaccine aimed at coronavirus. The science has not changed. Coronavirus mutates and this version of coronavirus is no different. There are already cases of people re-infected with coronavirus after suffering the illness, during this pandemic. The vaccine experience will be no different. The FDA is fast tracking its' usual safety protocols. I will not be a member of this mass experiment with vaccination. Microchipping aside, Bill Gates, has a commercial interest in the vaccine, and he can't even keep viruses out of microsoft - he has no credible credentials to lecture humanity about the virus, or the vaccinations.
1/1	Pro-vaccine: Intelligence
0	Probably because these ones are so effective. They stop transmission, stop infection, stop hospitalizations...oh wait...nope, they do the opposite of those things. They do seem to stop economies and free thought though.
0/0	Probably because they are young and, having followed the science, are aware that the vaccines do little to prevent transmission. If the risk posed to someone by a virus is minimal and the vaccines don't reduce the risk of transmission to others, on what basis should they be getting vaccinated?
0/0	Probably not for a while for my own reasons
0/0	Probably not.I am not in a high risk group. Chance of dying if infected would be low.
0/-1	Probably really hurt their economy with this particular move...

1/0	Probably, but don't assume this is statistically significant.
0/0	Problem in india, even govt assure you for death compensation over vaccine side effects related death, but fake inquiry will prove it, normal death.
0/0	Problem is with proper testing. It usually takes 5-8 years to know all side effects. Make decisions in pressure and fear is not scientific at all.
1/-1	Problem is, conspiracy theorists are overwhelmingly not willing to change their minds, even with evidence.
1/1	Produce more vaccines so one group isn't pitted against another
0/0	Prof. Raoult's masterful reframing! We cannot say that the vaccine stops the epidemic, it is not true! We are at 10 billion doses! When you threaten to stop treating people if they don't obey something that doesn't make sense, that's dictatorship. We have to stop.
0/0	Professor Bernard Lascola of the IHU Marseille: "I am shocked. In serology, the antibodies of people infected with Omicron do not recognise the Wuhan strain that was used to create the vaccine. Booster shot totally useless‚Ä¶
0/0	Professor meant to say, the vaccines efficacy figures should be taken with a huge pinch salt
0/-1	Prolly not cause I'm pretty sure I already have it and I'm either a carrier or immune
1/1	Promising COVID 19 vaccine data coming from Israel. Science is working....... not magic

0/-1	Propaganda
0/0	Propaganda. don‚Äôt get brainwashed
1/1	Proper social distancing and closing down know arenas for infections are the way to go. Too few people seem to realize this in the US. A collective effort is needed, but is poorly understood by too many. Fingers crossed for vaccinations
1/1	Props to Edward for making vaccines a thing
1/1	Props to that guy who said he thinks of the vaccine like a civic duty.
1/1	Protect others, as well as yourself. VACINATE!
1/1	Protect your pet from COVID. It‚Äôs rare, but there have been cases. #WearAMask #Vaccinate
1/1/1/1/1	Protect yourself and get vaccinated
1/1	Protect yourself and your family by getting vaccinated
1	Protect yourself: Get vaccinated
0/0	Protection comes from God The Creator, not shady jabs made by shady corporations.
0/0	Protection from covid?? How?? If vaccinated, you can still get covid and still transmit covid.
0/0	Protective for now. Long term will tell a story if they even acknowledge autoimmune issues. Vaccines are tricky and deceptive.
1/1	Protective measures and vaccination should go in parallel to fight this virus. Hope people understand that we should act together during this pandemic, before it is going to be too late.
1/1	Proud lifesaver! #Imvaccinated
1/1	Proud of my hometown. Almost every eligible candidate for the #COVID19 vaccine took it. They did it because they know this is how we‚Äôll end this pandemic.
1/1	Proud to be a part of the 29% of fully-vaccinated Americans!
1/1	Proud to be part of the provaccine movement showcasing conversations with vaccine hesitant parents and the importance of making every contact count.
1/1	Proud to be pro vaxx
1/1	Proud to be selected to help out with the Covid vaccination programme! Finally able to do my bit to help with the fight against this horrendous virus!
0/0	Proud to call myself an Anti-vaxxer.
1/1	Proud to have taken the vaccine early on. I'm 99% sure there won't be any bad effects but even if there is, I'm okay with being an important part of the advance of medicine. Millions have died before us that we have learned from. There are always risks in this life. If you're worried about risking the vaccine, then you should be worried about getting covid, or drinking, or being overweight, or making left hand turns. We constantly take measured risks, and the payout of a safe vaccine is worth the small amount of risk.
1/1	Proud to say my only grandma is fully vaccinated now. Ready to celebrate her 89th birthday in two weeks
1/1/1/1	Proud to say my only grandma is fully vaccinated now.. Ready to celebrate her 89th birthday in two weeks!!! Thank you everyone making this happen.

1/1	Psh, well, this finally convinced me to get the vaccine
0/0	Psuedo science "logic": No one dies from the vaccine because we attribute all deaths to Covid.
1/1	Public health is an economic issue. The cost of a vaccine is a miniscule fraction of the cost of shutting down the economy so any government should be willing to spend perhaps a few hundred million in order to save themselves a few hundred thousand-million.
0/0	Public need the truth...I still say NO. I trust my immunity and actually the misrepresentations are the very ones we are being bombarded with daily!! Fake news is what I see daily from BBC to the rest. If it wasn't fake why did they not show all the turnout in cities against the jabs?? Why do they not let us know of the people in UK as well as the globe that got severe side effects inc death?? No body died of Influenza as of 23rd March 2020 to date!!! Now that's a coincidence or am I a conspiracy theorist???
0/0	Public will never trust it nor will we take it. No forced vaccine that attacks your dna. This is criminal. Don‚Äôt take this poison. It is u tested. No placebo testing. Unsafe.
1/1	Publicize that unvaccinated patients will be charged a premium for medical services. At this point obstinacy is willful stupidity.
0/0	Publix/Walgreens/Walmart and multiple places have the vaccine. Please ask yourselves why we are being conditioned to allow OUR MILITARY to infiltrate our neighborhoods to inject Americans with an, experimental, liability-free product that was classified as"unavoidably unsafe"?

0/1	Quackery has no place in a modern world
0/-1	Question for media experts: why do mainstream shows like @24hPujadas don't say that Israel broke its record of severe covid patients despite 667 thousand 4th doses and with the Omicron variant? Is this religious or journalistic behaviour?
0/0	Question though, even with SARS and MERS research how does that help the situation? SARS, MERS, and the common cold are all in the corona virus family with COVID and yet even with all they research they have, scientists have been unable to create a reliable vaccine for SARS, MERS, or colds. How am I supposed to trust that COVID is any different?
1/1	Question! I had bad side effect to the astra vaccine (or maybe good immunity response) 10 hours after first dose , chills then high fever and muscle aches, BUT two days later I feel extremely well and I mean a feeling of being extremely healthy, even my skin is glowing, maybe its psychosomatic but I'm wondering if others are feeling this.
0/-1	Question, I can‚Äôt remember my source but when I watched the video and looked up the person she did seem credible. She was saying that the vaccine contains graphene oxide as well as the booster. This is a poison. And it isn‚Äôt listed in the ingredients but hidden under proprietary ingredients. What are your thoughts on that and why they would need to put graphene oxide in us and continue to do so with the boosters?
0/0/0	Question..... Many Americans are running out to get the bogus Corona Vaccine, so when the next bio weapon is released will those same people be getting the next experiment vaccine too??

0/0	Questions about getting an untested vaccine that offers no protection and doesn't lift your restrictions and concerns about side effects and complications is just COMMON SENSE.
0/0	Questions we are not supposed to ask 1 - Why are people still required to wear masks even after vaccination? 2 - Why are companies requiring that countries who buy the vaccines cannot take legal actions following the purchase? If your products are truly safe why are you making that requirement?
1/-1	Queue all the anti-vaxxers with skewed statistics and links to random WordPress sites
1/1	Quick fact of the day: Vaccines prevent more than 2.5 million deaths each year.
1/0	Quick note for those who don‚Äôt think the virus is that bad. COVID-19 is definitely a dangerous disease though it varies from person to person. The effects of the virus can be different based on a multitude of factors and while it‚Äôs more dangerous among those who are immune compromised, it also affects people based on their genetics. I did unfortunately lose family..... my aunt was very healthy and still lost her life.... vaccines do indeed have fragments of the virus but it tells the body what to fight and how to fight it. My mother and father are both immune compromised. My father with an extensive heart condition and my mother grappling with dermatomyositis (a vicious and rare auto immune disorder.) Some of you out there say that taking a vaccine is a choice and while it is ultimately your choice, it‚Äôs for not only your safety but it‚Äôs for others as well! Now for those of you who are in open defiance of the vaccine and stop people from getting it, (Like the ignoramuses that forced the dodger stadium facility to shut down.) you need to stop! If you‚Äôre so damn adamant about choice in this matter then why aren‚Äôt you letting others make the decision for themselves! Stop doing this! It helps no one at all!

1/1	Quit caring about the unvax long ago. Do care about the stats and results however. Keep it going unvax fools.
1/1	Quite informative. I had the 1st dose a little over a week ago. Felt great afterward, but then I felt intense tiredness and of course, as expected, pain at the site of vaccination. I did yoga that evening, then the next day I was back to my HIIT routines. The 2nd dose is what I‚Äôve heard could be a KO lol.
1/1	Quite relieved because I got my 3rd shot of covid vaccine.
1/1	Quote from my mom, a nurse "you don't need every vaccine there is, but the ones that children get and that you constantly get told to refresh are important and everyone should get them." (My personal add on, there are people who can't get vaccines because of medical reasons, but the number of these people is tiny and the only way to protect them is for us to be vaccinated)

1/1	Remember, it's still important to get your flu vaccine this year. I urge all patients in later phases for the #COVID19 vaccine to get their flu shot as soon as it's available, and then get their COVID-19 vax when they can. This will help to minimise strain on the health system.

0/0	Right off the bat when they parrot it's "SAFE" they are lying to you - short term data does show a high morbidity and even mortality rate compared to other vaccines (such as the well established flu vax).

1/1	Right on! Vaccinated and boosted and recovering from covid. A mild case thanks to the vaccine and booster.
0/-1	Right thing is protecting yourself by not accepting poison
0/0	Right up until we introduce a brand new kind of vaccine with new technology in which we have no idea if there are any negative long term effects.
0/0	Right, how stupid of me, to be concerned about taking a private, untested drug made by a heavily corrupt, liable free company ''regulated'' by a bribery infected regulatory (CDC/FDA), for an originally mild disease that is now statistically 98% less serious than it was 100 years ago, just through infrastructural-hygiene based development alone, that will make potentially 100s of billions of dollars over the next decade! On top of that, it's not like I can even, just, eat healthy natural food, get exercise, stay fit, and drastically increase my chances of survival, either! Obviously, I should just stick to big macs, coke and fries and watch Netflix all evening, then go to get my vaccine, come back home, take my insulin shot, and pop my oxycontin, because I don't want to be a silly anti vaxxer do I!'
1/1	Right, the vaccine is most likely not in your system after 2 months, but has taught your immune system how to fight COVID at that point.
1/1	Right?? I keep saying, I don‚Äôt need the vaccine, I need everyone else to get the vaccine so I can go out for dinner again!! I‚Äôm joking, I will get it of course, but i am 27 and healthy, I‚Äôm a low priority.

0/0	Sadly, the long term damage from these jabs will be immense.
0/0	Safe and effective at reducing the population for Bill Gates, AND making Bill Gates more money. He is a smart man :)
0/0	Safe and effective with all of the damage that it has done, not to mention the deaths, wow I don't believe it!!!
1/1	Safe and effective.
0/0	Safe and effective? OPENVAERS. Over a million reported AEs. 21,000 deaths. Early treatment, over 200,000 treated with safe, effective, non-patented generic drugs. Pushing dangerous vaccines that don‚Äôt even work. How do you sleep?
0/0	Safe! How would they know? How long has it been tested? How will it be stored properly? What are the long term effect? There is absolute zero way to know any of this.
0/0/0/0	Same company that didn't say anything about their deadly powder ohhh that company no thanks lol
1/-1	Same goes for the vax.
0/0	Same here I got vaccinated than I got vertigo before that I was well fine
1/1	Same here! One down. Took 25 minutes total from time I drove in to time I left including 15 minute rest period. Feeling good.
0/0	Same here. I'm not proud, per se. It's just nobody's business to coerce me into getting a shot. I initially rejected the vaccines due to scientific concerns, but now it's purely a matter of principle. I'm not taking the shots simply because I don't trust the people who push for them.
1/1	Same in North Brooklyn/Greenpoint. Trying to find local, nearby available vaccine location for elderly parents
0/0	Same issue across the Nordic countries as well. I‚Äôm Canadian but my Finnish girlfriend was explaining this to me not long ago. Hearing that makes me hesitant to trust rushed vaccines...
0/0	Same issue with Johnson & Johnson vaccine now! Today 4-13-21 they halted the use of this vaccine due to six women developing a rare unusual blood clot. Of the 6 women one has died and one is in critical condition!
0/0	Same old,same old...all I hear is umm,umm. And they still have no clue that it will work.. go get ur shots , I'll wait a few more years and stick to my shot of tequila
0/0	Same people that made the vaccine have killed millions of people with prescription medication and been fined billions of dollars for deaths and severe side effects. We should blindly trust no one.
0/-1	Same propaganda story every day for months. You guys are doing a bang up job
0/0	Same thing with my brother after the vaccine he got bump over his body and died after 4 days
1/1	Same, allergic to Penicillin so I will ask if that would be an issue, if so another vaccine may be for me. this is one vaccine so hopefully another may be "safe" for those who are allergic.
1	Same. I get my second dose on Saturday, two weeks to the day I fly out to see my (vaccinated) father and I can‚Äôt wait! I‚Äôm also flying the day after my second shot with a group of (vaccinated) friends to the Touch Of Disney event and I can feel my life getting back to normal. I had a Jamba Juice with a friend at the mall during her lunch break the other day and ran into two old coworkers I hadn‚Äôt seen in over a year. It felt so good and normal. Making plans to go see Black Widow in the theater in July. I‚Äôve been safe but slowly living life again (I was in the ‚Äúwiping down my delivered groceries‚Äù camp at the very beginning) and have eaten out, gone on hikes, and generally been as safe as I can while still maintaining my mental health. Getting dumped during the pandemic didn‚Äôt help so I absolutely am going to live my life to the Max after I‚Äôm fully vaccinated.
1/0	Sarah Palin: "I'll get the vaccine over my dead body." COVID-19: "Your terms are acceptable."
0/-1	Satisfactory trials simply cannot have been conducted in the time these vaccines have been rolled out. If they give others the vaccines they may well discover the vaccines are not as efficacious as claimed. PEACE ;]

0/0	Save yourself and your generation. Don't take it and don't let anyone you love take it either.
0/-1	Saved millions of lives? Seriously?
1/-1	Saw a misleading headline that said someone got Covid despite being vaccinated. The vaccine is not a miracle drug. I‚Äôm no MD, but my understanding is after inoculation, hopefully you won‚Äôt die if you contract C19.

0/-1	Science can't make you immortal, just saying.
1/1	Science deniers big madd
1/0	Science for the mic-drop. Can you believe they made those first vaccines in just 9 months? Just a bit longer, keep masking properly, keep isolating, don't let up and we are almost there.
0/0	Science gets it wrong all the time dude, people are hesitant to blindly trust something with unproven long term complications when it‚Äôs their life on the line, people are allowed to be skeptical, you don‚Äôt have any high ground over them
0/-1	Science has failed before, more importantly humans make mistakes and have failed before.
1/1	Science has shown vaccines to be effective.
1/1/1/1	Science is amazing! So many emotions as I got the second dose. Proud to be fully vaccinated!
1	Science is awesome
1/1	Science is beautiful! #COVID19Vaccine
0/0	Science is happening right in front of our eyes. The 2 most vaccinated countries in the world Israel and Australia are experiencing the largest amounts of new covid cases. Stop calling it a vaccine. It's gene therapy, that's causing more harm than good.
1/1	Science is so beautiful
1/1	Science isn't a belief and vaccines have been studied extensively.
1/1	Science of vaccines. We use them for measles, mumps, whooping cough, polio etc. We are so blessed there is a vaccine for Covid and variants already.
1/1	Science rules!
0/0	Science shows that more people die from the vaccine than covid.
1/1	Science wins in the long run. You better think for yourself and get vaccinated people!
1/1	Scientific Data shows that the vaccine does actually protect you, especially from death and the worse symptoms that would hospitalize you, but Conservatives are famously anti-science at this point.
1/1	Scientific consensus supports vaccines.
1/1	Scientific data is there for all to see. There is overwhelming evidence the vaccine does more good than bad.
0/-1	Scientific proof that they work? Israel has the high deaths per capita and highest vaccination rates. What science u guys doing lol

0/0	Scientists and doctors can be bought just as easily as politicians.
1/1	Scientists and government safety experts. It was tested like other vaccines.
1/1	Scientists are developing tremendous weapons to fight Covid 19 virus. Vaccines on the market have already a high efficiency in protecting the organism against this virus. Other vaccins more efficient will be quickly available.
0/0	Scientists fail to find vaccines for aids and cancer but create a high tech advanced c19 vaccine in a short timespan of months. Something's fishy.
1/1	Scientists have been researching Covid for years. They know what they are doing.
1/1	Scientists should be earning more than sports men. They're the real heroes.
0/0	Scientists still don‚Äôt have conclusive data for vaccine effectiveness and risks. People shouldn‚Äôt get vaccine unless they‚Äôre high risk individuals.
1/1	Scientists were prepared for a pandemic while we were thinking about the zombies apocalypse. XDXD
0/0	Scientists will say it's safe because there's no skin inside the human body
1/1	Scotty? ScoooooOOOOOtty? Where the bloody hell are ya mate? I want my COVID vaccination. How do I get it? When do I get it? What vaccination will it be?
0/0	Screw getting this vaccine
1/1	Screw it. The data is clear: not getting a #Covid_19 #vaccination is practically suicide. #AntiVax types are hard-core anti- #science nuts. They're begging to die. Taking #JoeRoganExperience off #Spotify won't do jack. At this point, it is some needed Social Darwinism | #Opinion

1/1	Second #CovidVaccine down! WOOHOOOO!! So far, I don't feel nearly as bad as after the first one, so that's good! Two more weeks and I can finally (carefully, discerningly, and masked-ly) do stuff!! (My shirt says "got my Fauci ouchie," and yes, I'm very proud of it!)
1/1	Second Pfizer shot yesterday. As advertised, not as easy as the first but glad it is done. The aches, pains and other side effects are worth it in my mind. Take your advice from medical professionals, not politicians. We all play a role. Happy to be a lab rat if it helps.
1/1	Second dose complete! Can I PLEASE travel now!??
1/1	Second dose of #COVID19Vaccine done! Vaccines are safe, effective and the key to ending this pandemic
1/1	Second dose of @AstraZeneca vaccine done - bring on restrictions easing & back to some sort of normality. #coronavirus
1/1	Second dose of Moderna. I‚Äôm feeling like I was hit by a truck‚Ä¶.. pretty great!
1/1	Second dose of the vaccine is no joke but certainly worth not getting covid and being able to do life again
1/1	Second dose of vaccine done. Wearing green for hope that this pass soon
1/1	Second dose today! I cried tears of joy with my first because it was the first time in 9 months that I had hope.
1/1/1	Second dose, received! #COVID19 #vaccine #pandemic
1/1	Second shot is making me feel like I just ran a marathon. My body aches, my skin feels sore to the touch, having headaches, fever and chills. It sucks. Still glad I got it though bc I am asthmatic.
0/-1	Second shot is making people sick!
1/1	Second shot on the 15thüòä and an months later...
1/-1	Second vaccination hub opening in Shropshire this week; so grateful to be part of this project! I‚Äôm humbled by the dedication of the team!
1/1	Second vaccination of moderna today so far no side affects
1/1	Second vaccine shot acquired! I'm officially on Team Pfizer now. No symptoms other than my weird metal tasting powers, but we're still going to take it easy tonight with chill SAB - no trib! - and raids tonight for a short stream. Going to be gentle on myself just in case!
1/1	Second vaccine. The relief cannot be described.
1/1	Second, the resulting vaccine works at an almost unprecedented level of effectiveness
1/1	See I feel that anti-vaxxers are putting their own bad experiences and pseudo concerns over their own children
1/1	See all the unvaccinated folks are giving the virus a home to mutant into a different variant. Maybe one that the vaccine can not handle. That makes this a social issue not a personal issue.
0/0	See people are having extreme side effects
0/0/0	See, I told you these vaccines don‚Äôt even work
1/1	See, I want the vaccine so that I CAN spend 15 hours in a Target.
1/1	See, it's really annoying bc people will point to the protests and be like "this is why you can't make the vaccine mandatory, you'll have a revolution," but I really feel like making it mandatory would contain the outcry. Once everyone's been jabbed, they'd forget ab it
0/0	Seeing as you can still GET it and can still SPREAD it with the vaccine, WHY BOTHER!??? Oh wait- you can't? Then WHY WEAR THE MASK STILL?????????????
1/1	Seeing events like this provokes fascists thoughts in my very liberal mind. A friend jokingly said we need a Duarte. The president of the Philippines is a HORRIBLE person but anyone caught without a mask is arrested and detained in a stadium. Wouldn't it be cheaper to offer anti vaxxers/maskers a reservation of sorts? Someplace pleasant, with all the organic or junk food they wanted. Even though our tax dollars would have to pay for it, I imagine it would be cheaper than the huge medical bills we're paying.
0/-1	Seeing this on the news makes me happy. Vaccines should never be mandatory
1/1	Seeing this really breaks my heart. Since this pandemic I've personally lost around 16 people between me and my partner. None were vaccinated and I still don't understand why people aren't choosing to live vs ending up in the hospital or dead.
1/1	Seek medical advice and get vaccinated.
1/1	Seems good news - if you've had the Pfizer.
1/1	Seems like FDA wants to listen to the twitter trending hysteria crowd. Its decision to pause a much needed, safe vaccine. Let‚Äôs highlight the facts: Six cases out of 6 million plus doses administered is an indefinitely small quantity; a value approaching zero.
1/0	Seems like The doctor and nurse see the whores of covert 19 and out of fear they want everyone to take it but it doesn't validate if The vaccine works and if it's safe To me it's more out of desperation and fear
1/1	Seems like a lot of places are still limited by supply. Here's to hoping that the J&J plant gets approved and more doses from Moderna and Pfizer come along.
0/0	Seems like a perfect Recipe for "I am legend" disaster.
0/0	Seems like helping people understand and strengthen there immune systems and lymphatic systems would work better cause the strain is changing and the vaccine doesn‚Äôt cure or prevent
0/0	Seems like we are the worlds Guinea pigs. I remember having them as pets and they always ended up stiff.
0/0	Seems like we have become like animals... one does it we all do..One animal moves they all do. Not me..There has been no proof ..I have researched since this virus started..I see nada that proves anything this country is believing. Not saying there isn‚Äôt virus because there is..Im speaking on the vaccine. Be safe
1/1	Seems like we might be ok
0/-1	Seems like you both are well informed about vaccinations, why not make your own vaccines?
0/0	Seems like your paid off by big pharma...Follow the $$$$$..
0/0	Seems odd that in our modern age where we supposedly know so much these strange new maladies "occur". With profitability comes rationale to force people to take these jabs. It's my right to decide if I want to take the chance one way or the other..
0/0	Seems to be a lot of "we don't know" going around in the medical world about the virus. If you have all these question still, how do you know for sure this vaccine is working and the long term effects it will have on individuals?
0/0	Seems we being used like lab rats...shove your vaccine
1/1	Selling my mom's glasses on Facebook marketplace until she agrees to get the vaccine
0/-1/0	Send all that poison back
1/1	Send it to me! I take it immediately!
1/1	Send the anti-vaxxers home NOW. My fucking god. Nobody should have to die because of these trash people.
1/1	Send the vaccine our way. There are many of us who would take it
0/0	Sensible people will continue to live their lives without taking the jab.
1/1	Serious question: why are you unvacinated people still going to doctors and wasting their time and literally killing people taking up beds begging for help from science. I thought you didn't want western medicine? Why do you see a doctor for a cold? Flu? Diabetes? Etc but when we have a vacine available that billions have taken you just fold and become a joke. Please go see a doctor at your education level. I'll start, "OH you have covid and your IQ is 50 you should rub some branches on your leg and say hail Mary 10 times. That should do it."
0/0	Serious side effect: Enormous thirst for alcoholic drinks in first few days, and then a failure of..
0/-1	Serious? Who in their SOUND MIND, would accept that!
1/1	Seriously I'm actually writing a paper debunking anti-vaxxers, any and all anti-vaxxers please give me REAL reasons why they are so bad.
1/1/1/1	Seriously each and everyone must take vaccination as early as possible.This is the only way to control the covid.
1/1/1	Seriously get #vaccinated https://t.co/FNvuIQDY3F
1/1	Seriously make it so the vaccines go to whoever signs up first... I'm tired of having to listen to Anti-vaccers rhetoric. If they don't want it its fine! There's alot more people who wants it now so they can stop worrying and go back to their usual life.
0/1/0	Seriously though, why can‚Äôt a person make their own choice about getting jabbed without ridicule?
1/1	Seriously though. If you don‚Äôt want a vaccine, go the fuck home. Who the fuck are you to impose your mislead, ill-willed bullshit on everyone else? Sincerely, fuck off.
0/0	Seriously turn off your tv and go read some data. Children have more chance of dying from the flu. .002% chance of dying. They‚Äôll probably get hit by a car before they get seriously sick with Covid unless they have severe health issues. The vaccine has no benefit, still catch it
1/1	Seriously why so many dislikes? Please put in your part to making the world normal again!
1/1	Seriously, I met a nurse in the laundromat recently. He got his first dose of vaccine. He said he just got in the shortest line. Just get vaccinated!
1/1	Seriously, we all need vaccines.
1/1	Seriously. I get so annoyed with those that don‚Äôt believe that this is all abnormal. Like the people who believe the covid vaccine will turn them into zombies. Cant we ship them off to Pluto
1/1	Seriously. I‚Äôd love nothing more than getting the vaccine this very second. I‚Äôll probably get mine in maybe April if I‚Äôm lucky.
1/1	Seriously? Because our ancestors survived without vaccines, that's why we don't need vaccines? I guess the billions of people that could live today, if their ancestors wouldn't have died of measles, polio, etc., would say otherwise. Maybe ask the native Americans north and south, how many of their people died when Europeans brought them their diseases. They wouldn't have, though, if they would have been vaccinated. Got it? Or still too complicated for you?
1/1	Seriously? Okay. I was vaccinated in a third world country and I didn't die. Good enough
1/0	Seventy year old woman in good health. Moderna dose 1: sore arm ( couldn‚Äôt raise above shoulder height for a few days). Sore at injection site for about 3 weeks. Moderna dose 2: flu like symptoms, ice pick headache on right side, tingling on tongue right side. Symptoms gone within 48 hours. It wasn‚Äôt pleasant but I feel very fortunate to have been able to receive the vaccine. Would do it again.
0	Several of my friends with the vaccine feel tired and sickly... Is it not supposed to be helpful?
0/0/0/0/0	Several people I know who have been vaccinated still ended up getting the virus in the months following 2nd shot and boosters. Not only that, they also had severe discomfort caused by the vaccine itself in the days following inoculation.
1/-1	Sh!t, Ohio's one of the most anti-vax states? Seriously? I used to live there...
0/0	Shall we call the 30 people who died in Norway as a result of the vaccination minor?

0/0	Shamming me through a talk-down to the audience video. You've convinced me to NOT get the vaccine.
0/0	She couldn't find peer-reviewed research on the negative effects of vaccines?! I laughed out loud! Studies are done when there is the promise of money or power at the end of the research rainbow.
1/1	She doesn't want to inject life saving medicine but she does inject plastic into her face
0/0	She doesn‚Äôt want to do the test on natural immunity. She wants EVERYONE to get the shot. Why? A true doctor would not push the shot so hard. It‚Äôs all about the money!!!!
1/1	She forgot that she is not a doctor. Actually I'd be surprised to see a doctor not wanting to get vaccinated.
0/0	She got moderna and she knew something was wrong. 2nd dose was horrific. Our next door neighbour 35 years old also got modern and 2 months later she had a Stoke 10 days in hospital. Something is not right at all.
0	She is absolutely right its poison keep it for the sheep never a pandemic never was we are being controlled!!! Mat hancock literally laughing at everyone says it all
1/1	She is correct. A shut down only will be able to cut down the chain of transmission. Vaccination is adding another one more arsenal into the armouryy of our fight against COVID but no vaccine as we know is 100 percent effective in Preventing the disease. So sense should prevail.
1/-1	She needs to listen to the doctor's
0/0/0/0/0	She needs to prove that it saved anyone. It doesn't prevent anything and people have been hospitalized for severe side effects and some died. This shot is dangerous.
0/0	She refuses to take the covid vaccine even in the face of family pressure.
0/0	She says that it's not proven that the vacine prevents spreading the virus then says that one of the reasons she wants it is to protect her mother. Lol
1	She should be EXPELLED from nursing school if she doesn't believe in vaccination!üò°
0/0	She texted a friend less than half an hour after having it saying she felt terrible and very ill. It just got worse and worse until she passed. It‚Äôs a direct vaccine-caused death. 100%.

1/1	She trusts documentaries over thousands of professional scientists????
0/0	She was 3 months pregnant when she was forced to get the "vaccine" in order to keep her job. 1 week after she got the jab, she had a miscarriage. I will never take this poison.
0/-1	She was offered to get it now, while we have to wait till probably late summer or autumn. Her reasoning? She wants to see the potential side effects when others gets first.
0/0	She's a liar there have been many bad side effects no thanks im not taking it
0/-1	She's answering questions with "I think." Do you know? You don't. I don't need my RNA edited.
1/-1	She's much better fighting Orcs and Trolls than medical science. Using her bow and arrows to shoot down the plain truth of vaccines is sad misuse of her fighting skills as an elf.
1/1	She's sitting there talking about how dangerous vaccines are, denying the unnecessary deaths that have been prevented since the advent of vaccines...how much work has she had done on her face? So vaccines are a really bad idea but multiple plastic surgeries are just fine? Her face clearly demonstrates her hypocrisy. Her opinions clearly demonstrate her inability to think intellectually.

1/1	Short answer vaccinate you fucking kid
0	Short answer: "it's good until we tell you to get another one"
0/0	Short answer‚Ä¶ no. After the roll out and everyone gets one blah blah blah. Then I will consider the REAL risk benefit analysis. There is absolutely no way to make that assessment with all the unknowns in this scenario. Would it be worth it to me PERSONALLY if the risk was rhumatoid arthritis? Perhaps lupus or some other autoimmune disease? That would depend on the percentage of people developing the issues‚Ä¶

1/-1	Should I be worried never had any side effects?
1/-1	Should I still get it even tho I beat covid already my only symptoms was a mild headache
0/0	Should be effective.... "Should" is the key word. They are still giving false hope. Then when it fails, they will continue to blame the unvaxxed.
1/0	Should keep in mind that 80-90% of hospitalizations occur in about 15% of the population. Everyone doesn't need to be vaccinated in order to make a big difference.
0/0	Should never ever be forced or pushed into taking the vaccine. I won't be taking it. Gonna leave the Matrix
0/-1	Should of asked him what‚Äôs going on at the Pfizer building in Paris.
0/0	Should people be forced to give up natural immunity that‚Äôs been around for millions of years and costs nothing or become dependent on a for profit drug company that has only been around 100 years and makes billion dollar mistakes that kill people?
1/1	Should vaccines be mandated? "Unsure. It's complicated." Should children be vaccinated? "Absolutely." End of interview.
1/1	Should we just all stay inside our homes then for a couple more years??? The fans had covid tests and wore masks. Even the doctors say vaccines and herd immunity will do more good than just social distancing foreve

0/0	Should, could, maybe, what kind of science uses these words? Oh its an experimental frankenstein juice, my apologies.
0/1	Shouldn't we stop the whole discussion about the use of vaccines, passes, facemasks and statistics by now? We know all this is not about health. We're distracted and wasting our time, We should rather set up an international think tank about how to create a new parallel society.
0/0	Shouldn‚Äôt we all be a little more agnostic about Covid and Vaccines. Everyone knows so little but believes so much. Pfizer isn‚Äôt god.

1/1	Shri Gajanan Mallya, General Manager, SCR receives 2nd Dose of #Covid Vaccination today at Central Hospital, Lallaguda, Secunderabad. Appeal to all eligible people to take the #vaccine & let's fight against #coronavirus #Unite2FightCorona #IndiaFightsCorona
1	Shut your fucking mouth. Get your vaccine. Go the fuck home.
1/-1	Sick of hearing about all this rubbish. Who really cares what goes on in Canada apart from locals. And notice how the Guardian allows comments on this subject but wont allow comments on anything debateable.
0/-1	Sick until proven healthy is no less tyrannical then guilty until proven innocent.
0/0	Side Effects "You just might die
0/0	Side Effects: "You just might die" lmao
0/1	Side Effects? Call it what it is, (EFFECTS) What do you expect with a Frankenstein's elixir created in months and tested not at all? You can have mine!
0/0	Side Effects? Call it what it is, (EFFECTS) What do you expect with a Frankenstein's elixir created in months and tested not at all? You can have mine! ??????????
1/1	Side affects are common with any vaccination whether it be those our kids have as babies or the annual flu vaccine !! The side affects are a good thing in that it proves the vaccine is stimulating your immune system !!!
0/-1	Side affects would‚Äôve shown by two months of taking the medication
0/0	Side effect - death. Enough said
0/0/0/0/0	Side effect - death. Enough said.
1/1	Side effects > Death. Informative video.
0/0	Side effects according to studies come after the 2nd dose
0/0	Side effects according to studies come after the 2nd dose of vaccination.
0/0	Side effects also includes death.
0/-1	Side effects are never "normal", common maybe, but using the word normal to describe how you body is responding to being poisoned is a misnomer.
1/1	Side effects are rare and mild. I'm taking the vaccine!
1/-1	Side effects are so difficult to pinpoint since there are so many external (and internal) factors to be considered with each individual and whether there‚Äôs any clear common denominators with all these cases.
1	Side effects are temporary and minor just like what you would get from a flu shot
0/0	Side effects aren't always an instantaneous thing though. I don' think most people are asking for a 5 year trial or anything, but these things have been tested for what, a few months, at most?
1/1	Side effects happen, but are often far less disruptive and dangerous to life than the actual disease. Its sad that this is even an argument.
0/1/0	Side effects include Bell‚Äôs palsy, rash, diarrhea, sensitivity to 5G, and erections lasting more than 4 hours
1/-1	Side effects include: may be less likely to die from Covid-19
0/0	Side effects of vaccines can take months or even years to show up, which is probably why it is being tried out on everyone working in the NHS. Showing up after only a day!! This particular vaccine has never been tried on mass human populations. They may hope to hide the side effects on NHS staff but I hope the staff are honest enough to publish serious side effects and especially deaths.
1/1	Side effects so far, sheer joy and gratefulness
1/1	Side effects that are incredibly rare though. Like I'd rather take that risk than take a much higher risk by not vaccinating.
1/1	Side effects usually kick in about 12 hours after the shot, but fade within 24 to 36 hours. The side effects are usually mild and transient. A sore arm at the injection site is the most common side effect from the vaccines.üëç
0/-1	Side effects worse after second dose straight out of the horse's mouth
1/0	Side effects, you get to live, youre welcome
0/0	Side effects. Will they really show us if there are serious ones? I don't know how true it is but someone was saying that a lady was paralyzed by it. I've been too lazy to look it up to verify it but I honestly don't trust these people to give us 100% truth.
0/-1	Side effects: I died, but starting to feel better.
1/1	Sign me right up, Joe! I‚Äôm fully vaxxed and looking forward to my 12 mos shot. I annually do my flu shot also. I‚Äôm guessing that eventually, flu and covid will be one in the same shot.
1/1	Sign me up for that
1/1	Sign me up for the vaccine!
1/1	Sign me up! The second I'm allowed to get it I'm gonna be there. I"m gonna make it an event. I'll wear a nice dress. Anything to help stop the spread and end this.
1/1/1/1	Sign me up!! Where can I get it??
1/1	Sign me up!!! Ill be first in line! Medical Miracle!
1/1	Sign me up.
1/1	Sign me up. At this rate the vaccine is a far better option than the virus.
0/-1	Similarly, the CDC recommends that people not receive the second dose if they had a severe allergic reaction following the first dose.
0/0	Simple answer to the question posed. Indoctrination and forced compliance.
0	Simple answer: I don‚Äôt want to get COVID-19, and I‚Äôm not stupid. It‚Äôs the same reason I‚Äôve been vaccinated against a whole lot of other things.
0	Simple as this, Don‚Äôt take it!
0/0	Simple explanation. A group of mad scientists with no souls created the COVID-19 virus and the same, said mad scientists with no souls created the vax. Souless creatures need to stop messing with dna or the outcome will be apocalyptic. GMO's, vaccines, wifi, etc have already caused cancer and auto-immune disease rates to sky-rocket. Thank the Lord I'm closer to my way out than my way in to this crazy world. Good luck with all this crazy stuff. Maybe they should just go back and occupy themselves with "reinventing the wheel". It'd be alot safer.
0/0	Simple it is a free America ! Our choice like women that want to have an abortion they say they have a choice so we have our choice no shots here you want it take it
0/0	Simple question. Would you as a doctor trust the vaccine enough to put your livelihood on the line. If let say 5 years from now we find out there is a huge side effect from the vaccine, would you be will to take the responsibility of providing those effected from vaccine side homes and incomes for the rest of their lives? Because right now the pharmaceutical companies have no liability. Maybe we put that liability on Medical professionals themselves and see how much faith they have in these vaccines
1/-1	Simple solution, force them to get it
1/1	Simple, Let's keep at it, these vaccines are saving lives...
1/1	Simple, Let's keep at it, these vaccines are saving lives‚Ä¶
1/1	Simple. They work. But they fade badly.
1/1	Simple: if you chose not to get vaccinated, hospitals are allowed to refuse treating you for COVID-19
0/0	Simply because even though vaccinated a person can still carry and spread the virus. This was explained during rollout and it was also explained that infection after vaccination was expected. Thats why we asked "So what is the point of getting the vaccine in the first place?"
0/0	Simply no use, only God can help. Lets pray to God.
0/0	Simply stop lying of the devil governments No for corona vaccine Don‚Äôt accept it
0/0/0/0	Simply stop lying of the devil governments No for corona vaccine Don‚Äôt accept the vaccine
0/0	Simply take Vitamin C, some Vitamin D and keep away from sweaty nightclubs and you'll never get the CV-19. Even if you did, you have 99.97% chance of living through it. But NO! Get that vax! NOW!
1/1	Since 1 week, vaccination is open to 12-17 year olds. Vaccination saves lives, vaccination protects us! Booster dose done
0/0	Since I am a Non-Citizen and following my previous tweet, I have just registered on the National Organ Donation Refusal Registry because if our health system doesn't treat us like the Vaccinated I don't see why my organs would be used in priority for pro-vax.
0/-1	Since I have my COVID vaccine I feel that my both legs and foot are always cramping that I don‚Äôt have before , my arms always numbness and hurting!
1/1	Since January 20, the Covid vaccination program proves to be an awe-inspiring example of presidential leadership and federal government orchestration. The speed and scale of the vaccinations have been astonishing.
0/0	Since getting the vaccine my bloodwork is not normal. maybe a coincidence but I'm not sure. I do wonder if I didn't take these shots if my bloodwork would be normal
1	Since it is an unproven, experimental vaccine, it's probably best we avoid 100% vaccination. That way if something unexpected happens there will be people left to repopulate.
1/1	Since it reduces your chance of dying from covid by over 90%‚Ä¶..yeah, I‚Äôd say it VERY good for your health.
0/0	Since it‚Äôs not really a vaccine by CDC definition, I think I‚Äôll take a pass
0/0	Since my first Covid Vaccine shot; Moderna at CVS in NYS on April 9th . I have experienced trouble breathing and neck pain that has not gone away. I eat a very clean diet but slacked off a bit so I decided to do a cleanse to see if that was the reason. I am still having isssues. I usually have abundant energy and now I am suffering from fatigue and breathing problems. I canceled my second shot last week and will not be getting it anytime soon. Please advise or if anyone else has experienced this please post. Thanks.
1/1	Since no vaccine has been approved for COVID, it‚Äôs not something to worry about. But overall, vaccines are generally safe. I don‚Äôt expect this one to be any different. If Health Canada approves one, I, as a Canadian , will not have any worries about getting it.
1/1	Since people cannot seem to be persuaded to wear a mask or practice safe distance, let's at least do that vaccination thing.
0/0	Since the 1st, 2nd and 3rd shot didn't stop covid the 4th will says crazy people
0/-1	Since the Covid-19 vaccine has been made available to the public 1. Coincidences have skyrocketed 2. The acceptable age for using ‚ÄúNatural Causes‚Äù as a cause of death has declined by decades 3. Side effects/Adverse reactions are a good thing
1/1/1	Since the beginning of this virus, I have been working with covid 19+ patients. Please vaccinate yourself and take care of people you love.
0/0	Since the rushed rollout of the untested COVID vaccine ‚Ä¢ Miscarriages up 300% ‚Ä¢ Cancers up 300% ‚Ä¢ Neurological problems up 1000% Neurological problems went from 82,000 annually to 860,000 in one year
0/0	Since the start of pandemic. I never had any fever and flu even pre pandemic. Not until i had vaccinated with first dose of pfizer last week. The side effects took after 6 days from my vacvination. And its the worst ever. Im even thinking not getting my 2nd dose
1	Since the start of the campaign, the number of deaths in elderly care homes has fallen drastically.
0/0	Since the vaccine doesn't stop you from getting Covid and doesn't stop you from transmission why do they force people to take it?
0/0	Since then we now know people do get sever allergic reactions, and many people reported here in the UK that they are still feeling very unwell after 5 days of having the Pfizer vaccine.
0/0	Since there are adverse outcomes other than deaths, we need to include disability in addition to mortality.
1/1	Since there are lots of anecdotal stories here, I will tell mine. I got vaccinated months ago. I feel great. Hope you do too.
1/1	Since this pandemic I've personally lost around 16 people between me and my partner. None were vaccinated and I still don't understand why people aren't choosing to live vs ending up in the hospital or dead.
1/1	Since vaccination has been talked about during this pandemic and since the campaigns have started worldwide, I never heard one thing this video tells, explains and illustrate us! From now, I have a much better understanding of how vaccines work! Thank you Vox! (from France)
1/1	Since we made the vaccine and are testing I think then it‚Äôs gonna end soon
0/0	Since we still do not understand genetic Material you are playing with our lives. Stick to the Parts that Trigger.
1/-1	Since when are PUBLIC schools not allowed to have vaccine mandates? Kids ate vaccinated against polio, diphtheria, tetanus, measles, pertussis, the list goes on. Servicemen MUST be vaccinated against a whole host of other diseases. What is wrong with these people? Have they ever seen someone die from mallpox? No, they haven't. You know why? BECAUSE OF VACCINES. God, the ignorance and complacency is mind boggling.
0/0	Since when did an experimental toxic injection become a vaccine?
0/0	Since when did not wanting to take a vaccine become a criminal offence? There's no way I'm taking a vaccine until it's been tested over many years... especially for a virus with such a low death rate!
0/-1	Since when does the government care about us
0/0	Since you stated that profit is not one of your motivations...Why will you not share the vaccine technology with other countries?
1/1	Sir thanks for helping 10th board Students.
0/0	Sir, but what did they do to develop this vaccine so fast....? Their fast development of the vaccine made everyone to disbelieve the efficacy of the vaccine.
1/-1	Sir,if people not following strict covid behaviour there is severe Need to bring lockdown
1/1	Sit back and relax. It will be this time next year until most of us see the vaccine. In meantime wear the mask, social distance, wash your hands, use sanitizer, and be careful too stay safe. God bless.
0/0	Sitting here not worried because I refuse to get that poison put into my body.
1/1	Sitting in the waiting area after getting my first dose üí™
0/-1	Situation is grave and horrible
1/1	Six out of seven million vaccinated. I'll take those odds any day.
0	Sjaak sir we don‚Äôt know the long term effects of corona vaccine (it hasn‚Äôt even been made yet). I will refuse it. Clearly out of common sense that medicine should be tested for years.
1/1	Skepticism is good and healthy. Skepticism that persists beyond the point at which a reasonable person would be convinced by presented evidence is called delusion.
0/-1	Skepticism since vaccines take time to develop and long term effects are an unknown right now. We have every right to be aware of what we put into our bodies since we only get one body.
1	Sky is blue, science is clear, and COVID-19 Vaccines Work!!!
1/1	Slightly biased towards mRNA based vaccine but nevertheless, a very simplified and excellent video on why vaccine in general is important. Keep up the good work!
1/1	Small price to pay for a great reward. Life! Us lot in our 30s may never get close to be vaccinated.
1/1	Small price to pay, considering the overall benefits of the vaccine
0/0	Smallpox took 15 years to develop and look how well that worked the old vaccines were good they actually worked a lifetime and side effects were small. These spiked proteins are not safe they cause clots they float in the body snd clump up in blood.
0/0	Smallpox vaccine, unlike Covid vaccines actually worked to prevent infection and stop transmission of the virus. It was not a leaky vaccine like the current ones.
1/1	Smallpox: Globally eradicated in 1980. Last case in Canada in 1962. History is proof that VACCINES WORK. Let‚Äôs send the #COVID19 pandemic to the archives! #COVIDVaccines #VaccinesWork
0/0	Smart man! I m not getting that shot either!
0/0	Smart man! I‚Äôm not getting that shot either!
1/1/1/1	Smart man! We need 70% of the population to be vaccinated in order to stop this pandemic in its tracks. Let‚Äôs do this people! Everyone wants to go back to normal!
0/0	Smart people understand how vaccines are developed not within a year of testing.
1/1	Smartest thing to do when Russia wants to take over Ukraine. Ukraine needs defense. Our priority is to dump the unvaccinated who are willing to put their lives on the line for their country. Come on. They vax the shit out of those guys and gals already. Let them serve. We are already low on numbers in our military.
0/-1	Smells like marketing. Ours is a bit better than yours.
0/-1	Smiling even more now 31 days and the eu is an even bigger shambles no riots in the uk and we have a majority elected government unlike most in the eu. And oh yes we have vaccine the eu trigger article 16 to stop vaccine being smuggled out of the eu but the eu do not have any to smuggle!!!!! Very bright idea thats even better than the dutch trying to sell pork to muslims.
1/1	Smiling so much under the mask üò∑ ‚ù§Ô∏è #vaccine #AstraZeneca #OxfordVaccine and I want to thank the amazing NHS staff who are making our world a safer place!
1/1	Smoking kills, vaccines save lives. If you smoke and you say you don't trust vaccines, you are an ignorant fool.
0/-1	Sniffy joe doesn't like stuffy noses.
1/1	So 6 people out of almost 7 million had a reaction, but they don't know for sure if it is the actual vaccine per say? So 1 in a million chance you could have an adverse reaction to something that has a 90%+ efficacy rate to prevent something that has a higher chance of killing you if you contract it? Yeah, by all means, stop the presses.... We have idiots running the show.
1/1	So Covid is ‚Äòcomparable to flu‚Äô, as Sajid Jabhead has confirmed. The people who have been saying this all along are the same people warning you off the ‚Äòvaccine‚Äô and it‚Äôs many ‚Äòboosters‚Äô. Just saying
0/-1	So Denmark,South Africa maybe Norway later this week have said NO TO THE ASTRA vacine..
1/1	So Ford would rather cancel a life saving vaccine ,limiting supply because someone might get hurt. All the while 10's of people die every day in Ontario from infection!! Let's just drag our feet for a few more months shall we??
1/1	So I am waiting to get my vaccine until more appointments become available in my area. And, that are closer to where I am.
0/0	So I can continue to gets shots OR just avoid it and roll the dice with a 99.7% survival rate? Tough choice
0/0	So I can still get Covid while vaxxed, spread it while vaxxed, and still have symptoms if vaxxed. Why do I need to get vaxxed again? This is when trolls jump on my message and say ‚Äúthe symptoms are less‚Äù ‚Äúit‚Äôs mutating because of the unvaxxed.‚Äù Give me credible sources.
1/1	So I got vaccinated and boosted. I socially distance and wear a mask and guess what? I‚Äôm fine. I‚Äôve never been infected. I‚Äôve never been sick. I stick to all the rules and keep safe.
0/0	So I just read through alot of comments on this video, and have seen some things said that people took an extreme too. I have never been vaccinated, but I am not anti-vaccine, I am pro-choice. I believe that there needs to be more study on the vaccines that are on the market today. The flu vaccine does not prevent the flu, the covid-19 vaccine is not effective because it does not prevent covid-19. People should choose whether or not they should take a vaccine, it should not be forced upon them. The reason I will never take one is because I know what is in them. And the chemicals are surprisingly deadly, like mercury. I don't care if you guys hate on this comment, I just think that you should try to understand every side of the situation before you cast your opinions. I know people who have been saved by vaccines, and I know people who have lost their children to vaccines. There always two sides and neither side is wrong.
0/0	So I need to inject the vaccine in MY body so YOU can feel safe even though you are vaccinated? Lmfao. Make it make sense people. Yet the unvaccinated people are the "dumb ones."
0/0	So I suppose the side effect of death is okie, dokie.
1/1	So I will likely take a vaccine but if I can choose, it will not be the first available and not rDNA based.
0/0	So I'll keep getting a mild cold? Cool thanks for the heads up. What's the guarantee that a Vax for whatever the strain is protects better than the current stock?
1/1	So I'm 3 times unvaccinated. And symptom-free for more than 2 years.
0/0	So I'm not anti vaxx, but this is the only vaccine I am not getting. They rushed it. We don't know exactly what will happen
1/1	So I've been vaccinated for the first time for about 1 1/2 weeks and I didn't have any concerns because I know my body well and have never had any side effects. :)
1/-1	So I‚Äôm 64, an anti vaxer but got Phizer anyways.. I have allergies and an irregular heartbeat due to late menopause. I had fatigue, headache, sore arm, tiredness and a little dizzy. Went to bed and the next day it was gone.üòé
1/1	So NOW what's your excuse people, roll up your sleeves and get vaccinated! Do it for you, your family, your friends and your neighborhood.
1/1	So Nice
1/1	So a doctor on the new this morning said her second dose in the trial gave her "robust" response. I kind of chuckled at that description. Usually when I get the flu shot, I feel bleh for a few hours, then I'm okay. My temp goes up, but not feverish, I get muscle aches and cold/hot. This time around I was on an immune system "cocktail" for a few weeks. when I got my flu shot I had no reaction except my sinuses seemed to clear up. I wonder if there have been any studies if things like Vitamin B, C, D, zinc, etc might lessen the side effects.
0/0	So after all that it‚Äôs still comes to the fact covid had to happen to provide Ginny-pigs in order to test a theory and it‚Äôs still wasn‚Äôt a 50years in the making it was just a thought to dna sequencing. Science so great.
0/0	So after they have run the experimental vaccine using the oldies as labrats, they now decide that it's not safe for the youth to take. Jeesus!
0/-1	So all the people that got that covid vaccine shot doesn't mean you can't be re-infected you can still catch covid-19 even if you got the shot
0/0	So are you saying people should get one even it is NOT FDA approved and there is no information on long term side effects?
1/1	So as long as large numbers of elderly people remain unvaxxed or have waned protection, Covid will continue to be a major burden. If we want Covid to be over, and to be able to get on with our lives, we need to get everyone vaccinated.
0/-1	So at some point science is going to have to be honest and tell people this is the flue and it's going to be here forever like all flues.
0/-1	So based on this information, given that the vacine is based on the virus and having the whole virus entering the body will have the same effect there would be no point to inject anybody with the vacine that already has had the virus and has antibodies in his/her bloodstream.
1/1	So basically anti vaxxers dont wash their hands since soap only kills 99.9% of germs
0/0	So basically the so-called ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù ain‚Äôt a vaccine, but a mediocre therapeutic. We‚Äôve been conned! #VaccineHoax
1/1	So basically vaccines train your body to become stronger-
0/0	So basically we are the test subjects and if it‚Äôs all good than America and the FDA will approve it.
0/0	So being an unvaccinated in Australia now comes to the point, where you, your rights and the things you enjoy wont exist.Considering if you dont bend the knee, you basically cant go out unless near dead anyway, so wonder if renouncing citizenship will afford some justice to it.
0/0	So big brother forces you to do something that people feel is harmful to their children. Has any read what is in one vaccine shot? It's very surprising. Calling names like the people who don't believe "cavemen" doesn't help the situation.
0/1	So boosters for all... in perpetuity. Government is in total control of Medical care!üëç
0/0	So by the time you are unlucky enough to get globalist vaccine the mutations will be so powerful that vaccine will be rendered useless.And while they are telling you how bad you want the shot,you know it's bs. Where's the flu?where'd it go? Huh?!?
0/0	So can you explain to me , why did me and family get the flu shot last year. And All of us got so sick we almost ended up in the hospital ? I will Never get the flu shot again or COVID shot ! If it works so well then who ever gets it , shouldn‚Äôt worry if me and family don‚Äôt get it . Right ?because you will be safe from getting it.
1/1	So clear! I'll get 4 vaccines and 1 to go!
0/0	So deadly everyone I know who has had it, including those immunosurpressed have had zero symptoms. It was the vaccine they had which has made them really ill!
1/1	So disgusted with the non believers. We would all be dead if we hadn‚Äôt had science
0/0	So don't want to be a lab rats.
0/1	So done with Pfizer, big pharma, Fauci and democrat politicians
0/0	So done with all of this, let us have a free choice not. It is my body my choice
0/0	So effective you'll need another shot in 6 months and one every year
0/0	So effective, Big Pharma needed to be exempt from any liability. ü§ì Now let that sink in...
1/0	So effective, more cases than ever before we have. Working so well
0/0	So either way you can get it right? Hmm. So the only benefit is ‚Äúquicker recovery‚Äù. Why is it pushed so hard, I‚Äôm unvaccinated and had it once and was just tired and a lil nauseous for 3 days
0/0	So enlightening to hear a thoughtful, balanced, and wise perspective on this. The contagion race to get vaccinated "at your own risk" is disturbing to say the least.
1/-1	So excited for you! One step closer to normalcy!
1/1	So excited if the trials prove this to be safe and effective. It will be amazing to have our whole family vaccinated.
1/-1	So excited that this happened today. And feel very lucky to have access to the incredible organisation that is the NHS!
1/1	So excited to announce that i got the vaccine
1/1/1	So excited to get my first shot
0/1	So excited! Does anyone know how many dosages a month they can produce once approved?
1/1	So far 10 million vaccinations and only 40 allergic responses. So pretty good hope!!!
0/0	So far 2.78% of vaccinated persons developed adverse side effects and just after the first jab. The second jab will have a lot worse effects and the long term effects come later. This vaccination is completely unnecessary and in fact outright dangerous. It should be stopped.
1/1/1/1	So far all my grandparents, my mother in law, my step dad, 2 clinically vulnerable friends and my aunt and uncle have had the jab, which now is far more people than I know who‚Äôve had covid. To me that feels like we‚Äôre slowly winning.
0/0	So far in my own family....2 deaths hours after m RNA. 1 hospitalization 1 month after receiving m RNA vaccine
0/0	So far my natural immunity has protected me from at least two variants. Yes, and that‚Äôs without two, three, etc‚Ä¶ ‚Äúvaccoosters‚Äù.
1/1	So far so good! Maybe a bit extra tired but I‚Äôve had a long day so I probably wouldn‚Äôt put it down to the vaccine.
1/-1	So far the numbers show that only 0.1% of Covid 19 hospitalizations are vaccinated people. 99.9% of hospitalizations are un-vaccinated people. I guess your uncle was really unlucky.
1/1	So far the vaccines seem to provide equally good protection against the UK variant - which emerged in the autumn and has now become the main strain of the virus in circulation.
0/0	So far we have freedom to choose leave me alone never had a flu shot and I won't
1/0	So far, no one receiving the vaccine has mysteriously begun to find Bill Gates extremely attractive.
0/0	So fed up of being called an anti vax just because I don‚Äôt feel this vaccine would benefit me thank you Dr James for standing up
0/0	So glad I didn't have the failed AZ jab. Seems like it doesn't actually do anything.
0/0	So glad I have not yet put this in my body
0/0	So glad Omicron was so mild even for non vaxxed people with no prior infections. Californians need to get back to living and our kids need to be unmasked and stop the ridiculous Covid rules at our schools that don't work.
1/1	So glad many more Americans are willing to get vaccinated and get their children vaccinated. The only way we come out of this pandemic is through vaccination
0/0	So glad that I live somewhere that our kids don't have to wear mask and parents understand there is no need to vaccine their kids.
1/1	So glad that people are bravely speaking their minds about this. I work in healthcare and I've been fully vaccinated. I believe in the vaccine and have seen its benefits in my hospital. I CHOSE to have it because of many factors, and that choice was very important. Just because I believe in the vaccine, just because I have had it and am fine, it does not give me any right to push that on others. It doesn't give me any right to feel superior, or to mock people who make different choices. We should all be encouraged to do our bit, whether that's wearing a mask, getting vaccinated or regular testing etc etc. People MUST have the right to choose what is for them.
1/-1	So good news
1/1	So grateful for your excellent work and dedication to develop vaccine for COVID19.
0/0	So grateful to Steve James for pushing back against this vacine. As a nurse I have been told twice now I am deemed to loose my job the pressure has been immense. I could not sleep last night with chest pain caused by this nonsense. The main stream media are so sanctimonious in their interviews.
1/1	So grateful to get my first COVID vaccine. We have lost too many and suffered so much. Let‚Äôs all do our part to help us all heal.
1/-1	So great news
1/1	So half the population. We‚Äôre getting closer!!
1/1	So happy and proud to get my #CovidVaccine!! Thanks to the lovely Thelma, a former midwife, and all the other health professionals - it was super well organised and I am grateful!
1/1/1/1	So happy and proud to get my CovidVaccine!! Thanks to the lovely Thelma, a former midwife, and all the other health professionals - it was super well organised and I am grateful!
1/1	So happy the vaccines are finally helping me visit my family again
0/0	So happy they decided to rush out a largely unpredictable vaccine. Oh, and the fact that big pharma has no liability if it causes side effects or death. Way to go big brother. Idiots!!
1/1	So happy to get my 1st dose today, and at a mass Immunization site just 2 miles from my home. Many thanks to all the health care workers and support staff making this mass vaccination plan happen.
1/1	So happy to get my first shot of the covid-19 vaccine today, feel blessed.
1/1	So happy to have had my first Pfizer vaccine today x I can‚Äôt thank the scientists, NHS and all involved x
1/1	So happy to have my first dose ancious to get my second no bad side effects looking forward to saying goodbye to COVID
1/1	So happy to know my side effects to the second dose are a good thing. I can‚Äôt wait to feel better.
1/1	So happy to see people getting vaccines. I will get the vaccine ASAP
1/1/1	So happy we can get more to the folks who need them. Well done.
1/1/1	So happy you guys got your vaccine!!!!!
0/0	So he got the Jab and like to Died ! Rehabilitation and the rest ,yet saying its ..Ok ..That's Dumb ...
1/-1	So heart breaking; I‚Äôm still puzzled how as babies and kids we took far less engineered shots at a time when the science was much less than this Covid vaccine.
1/-1	So how long until the average person can get this vaccine?
1/1	So how many Germans have died due to not having a vaccination ! I bet this is considerably higher than restricting AV Vaccine?
1/-1	So hundreds of millions of people have received the COVID-19 vaccines without harm but it hasn‚Äôt been tested enough?
0/0	So if the vaccine only blocks symptoms, it sounds like it is just creating more asymptomatic spreaders of the virus rather than stopping it. I don't think you can call that a vaccine...a vector maybe..
0/0	So if this can be done in 10 months let get the cure for cancer by next week
0/0	So if we are doing a risk benefit analysis of getting the vax or contracting it naturally and my risk is very low of either dying or having permanent damage.... Then why am I getting this vax again?
0/0	So if you‚Äôre young and healthy can you please explain to me how the benefits outweigh the risks?
0/0	So ig you‚Äôre getting this ‚ÄúVaccine‚Äù that was made in 9-10 months?
1/1	So implausible. I believe you could call me at any time of the day or night offering a vaccine and I'd be there in ten minutes
0/0	So in Pfizers trial protocols they mention the risk of ‚Äúenhanced COVID-19.‚Äù It is my opinion that that risk was not thorougly mitigated. That is why I will not take it.
1/1	So incredibly sad! It's the same over here in Germany. The unwillingness to get vaccined by a more than just a small group of people is so frustrating. How can people claim freedom for themselves and thereby force others to work until total exhaustion in intensive care units?
0/0	So inject an experimental vaccine for an added 0.9% of survival... i‚Äôm good with 99% thanks
1/1/-1/1	So instead of a simulated attack, our own cells create the effect and the immune system attacks that and remembers it? Interesting
0/0	So is the vaccine guaranteed not to have any long term side effects? If so how was it tested for long term side effects in a span of less than an year?
0/0	So is the vaccine guaranteed not to have any long term side effects? If so how was it tested for long term side effects in a span of less than an year? That's right, it couldn't. I won't take the vaccine.
1/1/1	So it is becoming clearer that Pfizer's (and Moderna's too I'm guessing) vaccine is best in show, so to speak.
0/0	So it is useless vaccination .Let my body develope its own defence mechanism.
0/0	So it is useless vaccination üòÜ.Let my body develope its own defence mechanism.
0	So it makes you sick
0/0	So it seems we don‚Äôt have to depopulate the earth so long as the people are all signed up for a great scientific experiment on the human body. Got it. First step. mRNA vaccine.
0/0	So it takes the FDA about 5 to 10 years to allow a drug to come into the market, but they are okay with pushing a vaccine on the population of the earth within a year/year and a half at most? Also, who are the test subjects that were used, their age, their genetics, their smoking/drinking habits etc. If they're only using healthy people as their test subjects and that alone is only 95% that should worry a lot of people.
1/1	So it's okay to not get a vaccine bit not to get an abortion in Texas?
1/1	So its 75% effect of keeping you out of hospital, last time I looked 75% was good!
1/1	So it‚Äôs basically theory vs scientifically proved medicine
0/-1	So last night I'm at a party, Prob about 30 people there, nobody social distancing, no masks .love it, my kind of party...then out of nowhere we are talking to some lady and her 11 yr old daughter says out of nowhere, "just give me the dam shot so I can get on with life"....wtf!
0/0	So let me get something straight they over here suffocating us telling us we got to wear more than one mask because obviously one don't work we got to take more than one vaccine because obviously one don't work. we have people pass out and even die after taking the vaccine and we still got idiots that's lining up to take the vaccine they must not be educated on what has been happening to people who has taken the vaccine or either they do gambling with their life. Im not taking it I feel like if everyone around me has the shot and it's supposed to work so good I should be good then and don't need it. Same thing with mask if everyone around me has a mask on what the f I need to have one on for nah im good I'll just keep breathing in my oxygen while y'all keep breathing in your own toxic as carbon monoxide lmfao.
0/0	So let me get this straight ... Moderna signs a deal for an mRNA vaccine BEFORE China reveals that there is an outbreak!
0/-1	So let me see if I have this right . The PM,his colleagues,family & friends get the $20.00 ‚ÄúA‚Äùgrade vaccine immediately . The rest of us get the $4.00 ‚ÄúB‚Äù grade vaccine some time in the next year or so . The capitalist call for the opening of borders to make it more dangerous.
0/0	So let's recap. The vaccine has not saved many people, with variants that are increasingly harmless. On the other hand (and this is a coincidence according to the authorities), cases of HIV, mad cow disease, myocarditis, stroke, Guilain-Barr√©, etc. are exploding. Strange times...
0/1	So like the ps5. Everyone wants it. Nobody can get it. If you‚Äôre rich then u got it last month.
0	So many adverse affects and reports of death after vaccination. Long term prospects look even worse.
1/1	So many annecdotes.... so little evidence
1/1	So many emotions today while waiting and receiving my first covid vaccine! I chose faith over fear and hope for a better future
0/0	So many families have been waiting for this???? Are you high? No one wants this for their kids and if they do they should not be parents period!
0/0	So many gullible wanting this experimental drug
1/1	So many have already gotten the vaccines without getting any side effects. The vaccines are safe, there is no denying it.
0/0	So many have died immediately after getting infected from the vaccines
1/1	So many more people will die by not taking it.. Rip to them.
0/1	So many people I know took the double dose and still getting sick. This a miracle cure for big pharma profits only
0/0	So many people already died or got serious side effects from this "total, safe" vaccine with no longterm studies aswell i think i rather take the cance of 99,85% of surviving corona :)
0/1	So many people in these comments calling bullshit. So, where's your evidence that they're lying? Where is your evidence that doesn't come from companies that would benefit from lying? Companies that don't make money from the vaccines. How many of those say this is a lie? People accept things blindly, but if anyone here can accurately give me a website or a book or a company that has the criteria above, and is reliable, I will join the 'This is bullshit' side in a heartbeat.
1/1/1/1/1/1	So many people on here make it seem like vaccines are the worst thing in the world where people are literally making these vaccines to save lives. I'm all for the freedom of speech and ideas, but a bunch of y'all are stupid.
1/1	So many people posting who don't understand what a vaccine is or how antibodies work. Get vaccinated!
1/1	So many people suffering. As early as possible release in market. Every day very important day. All of researchers congrats
1/1	So many people, just scared of a tiiiiiny needle...
0/0	So many possible side effects.
1/1	So many unvaccinated people in my class.üôÑ
0/-1	So many videos trying to convince and lie to people... who funds them
0/0	So much drama about getting vaccine. Dr. Who? Cares. What happened to my body my choice? With all the drama and push, makes me suspicious.
1/-1	So much fear around this vaccine and people firm on how they believe it works
1/1	So much for J&J. That vaccine is as safe as any other. But you can stick a fork in it. Nobody will take it now, they‚Äôll demand the others, even though there could very well be something extremely rare with those vaccines too. Of course many of these same people will bomb their liver with hard liquor, smoke, eat McDonalds 4 times a week and think nothing of it.
0/0	So much for getting vaccine!! Vaccine is not effective against new variant!! Do you'll just be going it again!!
0/0	So much for ‚Äòmy body my choice.‚Äô
1/1	So much has been made of the after-effect from dose two. I had Moderna and had NO side effects. Don‚Äôt be afraid people!
0/0	So much hate from the vaccinated. Yikes
1/0	So much misinformation & anti-vaxxers out there. People don‚Äôt understand science or medicine. But health workers refusing is absurd as employers can demand it for the safety of patients.
1/1	So much negative feedback in these replies. I'm assuming those replying haven't lost anyone close to them to this virus. Happy to know.
1/1	So much negativity here as per Usual. We all should feel so grateful to the scientists ...
1/1	So much respect to the doctors for being so well-spoken and patient with the anti-vaccine people. I would've been screaming lol
1/1	So much stupid in these comments. Anti Vaxxers, 45 supporters, and COVID deniers are the dumbest ppl on this planet. If believing in science makes me a sheep.. bahhhh Bish Bahhhh
1/1	So much unnecessary death and suffering. Vaccines work. Reality doesn't reach some. We still need to get vaccinated asap and follow medical guidance to slow down this infection. This is a song of hope. Break Down These Walls.
0/-1	So my body my choice doesn't apply now huh lmaoo
0/0/0/0/0	So my take on this, it's experimental and dangerous
0/0	So my trauma from school and thinking I was a failure was upon me meeting the vaccination requirement? Lol. So I could of been whole this whole time. Thanks lol!!
1/1	So national lockdown for January, hold schools for two weeks so we can focus and push hard on a vaccination program
0/-1	So next year they'll say we need another one because like the flu it mutates.
0/0	So now "unvaccinated folks" are not "regular folks"? I never wanted to be "regular" anyway. üòâ
0/0	So now we are supposed to believe that artificial immunity (manmade vaccination) which is an attempt to mimic natural immunity, is more reliable than actual natural immunity?!? Yeah, right! Tell a lie long enough and people might believe it but guess what? It‚Äôs still a lie!
1/1	So out of 7 million people, 6 people developed an adverse reaction. Of those 6, 1 died and 1 has been hospitalised. How many of those 7 million would have died of covid though, had they not been vaccinated. I fear that figure would be way more than 1 person.
1/1	So overjoyed that my Mum has now been vaccinated!
1/1	So people are saying they‚Äôd much rather die than have a vaccine, I say that‚Äôs a win.
0/0	So people who have already gotten it have natural immunity that's something that they don't like to talk about because it's free
1/1	So pleased to be getting the vaccine
1/1	So pleased to hear Mum and Dad have their #vaccination tomorrow. #COVID19 has prevented seeing them for so long. Christmas felt especially hard as it did for so many of us. Shortly after Xmas I received this note in the post. It‚Äôs great to finally have hope of meeting again soon.
0/1	So proud of my fellow thinkers and the vaxxed team.
1/1	So proud of my grandpa. Today he got the first round of his

1/1	So proud to support the COVID-19 vaccination role out at Elland Road today. So exciting to be part of something so positive
1/1	So ready to be vaccinated!
0/0	So really the rest can wait for 2 years when the clinical trials are over...to be safe. Let's wait for the Guinea pigs results
1/1	So refreshing to have a pro vaccine message that doesn‚Äôt treat the listener like an idiot. Thank you!
0	So sad that my poor fellow coworkers in the medical field went from HERO TO ZERO in less then a year just because they refused to get vaccinated
1/1	So sad to see the people saying no to the vaccine when they barely have an understanding of medicine. We are going to be dealing with this virus for a while. Thanks for making an informative video.
0	So sad you are forcing our troops to take this sham of a vaccination
0/0	So sad, vaccine kill our youth
0/0	So sad. Masses have been brainwashed into an mRNA gene modifying experimental therapy called a vaccine. Virus recovery rate is better than the shot. People have completely turned off their brain.
1/0	So safe, definitely won't harm you. ;)
1/-1	So since your body requires the vaccine to produce the proteins, and this whole process is patented.
0/0	So some of the vaccine doses were placebos? That explains a lot
0/-1	So sorry for children these days
0/-1	So taking that vaccine so I can leave this world
1/1	So thankful i was able to receive the covid vaccines!!
1/1	So thankful that I was able to get my first vaccine today! Science at its best!
1/1	So thankful to receive my first Covid-19 vaccine
0/-1	So that will be the 4th or 5th jab in a year, depending where you live
0/0	So the Astra Zeneca vaccine was useless
1/1	So the anti vax people want to die rather than being alive
0/0	So the boss\medical expert from 'moderna',is saying this..and no one else is questioning a company pushing the virus panic button...lol.
0/0/0	So the disease said to be result of SARS-coV-2 infection causes blood clots.. who's to say these newly created approved for emergency use vaccines aren't causing some people to develop the covid-19 disease?
1/-1	So the doctors say it‚Äôs safe, the republicans that promotes the Senate insurrection say it‚Äôs not safe. WHO CAN YOU BELIEVE?
0/-1	So the genocide is generational now. First get rid of the elderly. Well in tradition‚Ä¶
0/0	So the older covid didn't kill enough so they got a new variant to pass around the world.
0/0	So the symptoms are the same as covid and the vaccination does not protect you?! You guys are a joke!
0/0	So the vaccinated pose a risk to the unvaccinated. Tell that to our world leaders who are making out that it‚Äôs the other way around!
1/-1	So the vaccine is what is saving us, and it is the only thing that is saving us. Holy fuck. This is a major historical moment.
1/0	So the vaccines are not stopping you from catching Covid. So you are still in the same boat are you not.
0/0	So the vaccines targets the spike protein in the virus. Yet the Spike protein is what is mutating aggressively in these new Variants. Uh oh
1	So then you‚Äôre ok with vaccines being developed and administered to the non-Neanderthals that want them, correct?
0/0	So there is no reason to Covid vax children
0/-1	So they are pretty much injecting you with the virus.
0/0	So they can come up with a vaccine for covid yet still can‚Äôt cure cancer. How about telling us what the long term side effects are u can‚Äôt cause u haven‚Äôt given it enough time. They want to give the elderly it first so they don‚Äôt have to pay them a pension n kill them off
1/0	So they don‚Äôt believe you can catch Covid but they do believe you can catch a vaccine make it make sense
0/0	So they expect people to take an untested rna/dna therapy that will edit their very being? Sorry....
0/0	So they plan killing off more Americans with this shot that has not been through enough time and trials
0/0	So they want us to take a vaccine from a company who made baby powder that causes ovarian cancer??? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ good try government!!! Not today
1/0	So they're effectively admitting that "those who refused the vaccine... died." For Fox that's progress.
0/0	So they‚Äôre admitting they have no idea what they‚Äôre giving these people.
0/0	So they‚Äôre still collecting and analysing data. I thought all the relevant studies would have been conducted before mass vaccinating. What other findings may be discovered in future studies? I certainly won‚Äôt be a lab rat....
1/1	So this video saying that if i you get vaccine, you get resistance 3?? I'LL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK
1/1	So tired of these self-centered people who think they are entitled to infect others with a potentially deadly disease.
1/1	So tired of this ... received my first dose of Astra, the time for my second dose is suddenly gone without explanation .. 6 pcs out of 6.8 million..suck just give me a vaccine now ..so tired ...
1/-1	So to be an antivaxxer I just find some random facts and state the opposite. Is that how it works?
0/0	So to be clear, you were ok until you had the ‚ÄòVaccine‚Äô, now you‚Äôre unwell....... Mmmmmmm, think I‚Äôll pass thanks!
1/1	So today I am getting my 2nd covid vaccine!! I am nervous but excited!! I am going into this believing all will be good.
0/0	So transparent that inital studies raw data are confidential and kept by labs until 2022/2023 ... Ahah
0/0	So true! Fuck the vaccine
1/1	So true, this pandemic only really starts to get better when people all over the world are getting protected.
0/0	So trust your body and its immunity power. No need for vaccination
0/0	So vaccines aren't effective against Delta, yet government makes vaccination mandatory
0/0	So we DOO have an immune system that can heal us without introducing unstable vaccines with little research and no long term cause information.
1/0	So we apparently know nothing about this virus yet weve managed to develeop a "vaccine" in 9 months
0/1	So we are guinea pigs? "take this stuff. It won't get you sick but you may get people sick". WT???" If the vaccine neutralized the virus in a person, how can it spread? By political magic?
1/1	So we don't trust the government and we don't trust big multinational companies. I get that. But when did we stop trusting doctors
0/0	So we get the vaccine but we can still get C-19, so we have to keep wearing masks and distancing! And we might have fever and muscle aches for 24-48 hours. Wow! Where can I sign up!!??
0/0	So we get the vaccine but we can still get C-19, so we still have to keep wearing masks and distancing! And we might have fever and muscle aches for 24-48 hours. Wow! Why the vaccine then!!??
0/0/0	So we gonna discuss the pentagon working on a microchip for covidor nah?
0/0	So we might either die from the virus or the vaccine?
1/1	So we need to get the vaccine out double quick with all haste . Use everyone inc volunteers to round everyone up and get it done 24 hours a day . That way we reach herd immunity and total protection in double quick time and then we can all start our new and rewarding lives sooner .....
0/-1	So we were right to be worried!!
0/0	So we won't be allowed to travel if we're not vaccinated? Where's our freedom there? Who's taking away our rights? It's crazy.
1/0	So weird the only side effect from the second covid vaccine I‚Äôve had was hearing a strange voice in the night say ‚Äúmicrochipping complete‚Äù
0/0	So we‚Äôre being good little boys and girls and getting vaccinated at the rate of 3 million a day. The three vaccine corporate giants will make over 32 billion dollars this year alone, and here comes another one to climb on the gravy train. Yet we‚Äôre now being told that we must continue to live in the kingdom of fear because we‚Äôre in another ‚Äòsurge‚Äô of the pandemic. So where is the evidence that the vaccines are doing any good?
0/0	So we‚Äôre just gonna ignore the fact that people die from the vaccine and also that those aren‚Äôt being recorded, the lady in this vid didn‚Äôt even get penetrated by the needle, because she knows the truth of the vaccine
0/0	So what about the people who are in the hospital with blood clots or the ones who have died after getting the shot? Lab rats
0/0	So what are they putting into their bodies is the question. 70 million of us knew there couldn't be a vaccine developed that fast
0/0	So what do you think the 6 people who got blood clots? Vaccine still safe ?
1/1	So what everyone really needs to think about is do they want to risk getting the ACTUAL disease (which definitely has possible long-term side effects and even death), or getting the vaccine (which has shown very few if any minor side effects, and no major ones, and definitely NO death)? So like, risk lung damage/brain damage/death, or risk something that has harmed no one?
0/-1	So what if I already had COVID-19, got vaccinated afterwards, got COVID-19 again, got the booster at the start of this year and got COVID-19 again last week. I didn't really feel a difference in the severity of the disease before and after vaccination. Actually, getting boosted triggered a worse immune response than when I first got sick without vaccine enhanced immunity or the COVID-19 infection from last week. I assume the lack of severity of the last infection was because of the recent booster, but there's still my first infection (probably when the first variant was around because there was no talk about other variants at the time) that wasn't as bad as the immune response. At this rate, I don't think I want to get another booster because I sincerely think I "have enough immunity already" and the spread doesn't really seem to slow down (variants, supposedly over time decrease of vaccine enhanced immunity).
0/0	So what is the point in getting the vaccine, then? Your risk either way remains the same.
0	So what's next? Does your neighbour have to be vaxxed also for you to receive treatment? Where are the trails against all these these traitors? Why aren't rope factories doing overtime making rope to help them along ...
1/1	So whatever vaccine you might receive, it‚Äôs much better to be protected.
0/0	So what‚Äôs the long term effects ? Oh wait... you don‚Äôt know because nobody does
1/0	So when do the rest of us get to be vaccinated? Been waiting long enough. We have an economy to rebuild and they're vaccinating pensioners.
0/0	So when the vaccines start doing damage to the population we should jail the politicians and reporters who endorse it.
0/0	So when will you list the possible side effects?
0	So when you both take the vaccine come back and give us your input! For the moment, no thank you..!
0/0	So when you both take the vaccine √∞≈∏‚Äô‚Ä∞ come back and give us your input! For the moment, no thank you..!
1/1	So where do we sign up and get in line for the vaccine
0/0	So where does the microchip go
0/0	So where in the submission from Moderna to the FDA do we find a statement that you would use as proof that the vaccine offers verifiable protection against symptoms, infection or transmission from sars-cov-2? Please quote the submission and link to it.
0/0	So who are all these shitballs still pushing the vaccine?
0/0	So why are we being forced to take it? these people are truly wicked.
0/0	So why did my mother got some symptoms after taking the vaccine? The vaccine is fake
0/-1	So why do you need the vaccine if you have already had the virus and recovered?
0/0	So why doesn't the medical studies show that it prevents infection? And why change the definition of vaccine?
0/0	So why has this still not been approved by the FDA then, yet the world is insisting on jabbing everyone with this?!?!
1/1	So why have we , the over 70 no say the we will take the Astro Zeneca vaccine. I am over 70 and sick of being put in a box. I want any vaccine ASAP. üò°
0/0	So why is the creator of mRNA vaccine technology Robert Malone warning us of their dangers?
0/0	So why is the news reporting that people are testing positive for Covid-19 after getting the vaccine?
0/0	So why take it if I can still get the virus makes no sense
0/0/0	So why take the vaccine if it's not helping the virus why should I put that poison in me? I am not taking it it's all about controling humans and money
0/0	So why ya'lls still wearing your masks even after receiving the vaccine though
0/-1	So will a vaccine passport be required to vote? Think long & hard about that before you answer. Also, in the past why didn‚Äôt businesses require customers to show proof of a flu shot? Spread the same way. Selective/convenient circumstances for a current agenda. Go figure.
1/1	So would these anti-vaxxers also refuse a blood transfusion from vaccinated blood?
0/-1	So ya upset about these 2 nurses but 1000 and 1000 of illegals cross our borders everyday and are unvaccinated where the outrage here
0/0	So yalk are happy with a vaccine that attaches to your DNA and changes it?
0	So yall want me to get the shot and the gov. Gives it free? And gov. Has their dirty little hands in health care huuuummmm that's like budwiser getting in the car insurance game. NO THANKS!!!!!!
1/1	So yeah, I regret not getting the booster sooner. I didn't realize all the science behind it being so important for omicron until it was too late. I couldn't believe a vaccine i got 6 months ago was already useless!
1/-1	So you can‚Äôt get it right away?
0/0	So you get this experimental vaccine, you can still get Covid, still pass it to others, and still have to wear a mask and social distance. This also doesn‚Äôt highlight the countless individuals who were injured by this vaccine in the short amount of time since it‚Äôs rushed emergency approval.
0/0	So you got the vaccine and now six months later you need a booster, then of course more after that, hello ?? And all the while let‚Äôs make sure you wear your beautiful .. succaarrss.. I‚Äôd rather die. Hahahaha .. ‚ÄúDeath is not the worst of evils‚Äù, says John Stark !! NH
0/0	So you have a chance to die twice :D who wouldn't want that. Update: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Just answered that dudes question lets see if youtube will post it :o
1/1	So you have more chance of dying by driving 250 miles. I think this vaccine bashing really has to stop. That‚Äôs the issue doing real harm around Europe especially.
0/0	So you have more paid vax-loving failbook trolls in the UK I gather? That's why the three billion "vaxed" numbers we hear there? I'm terrified to even think what has already started happening..
0/0	So you should go ahead and trust their science. along with J &J and their lawsuits . Good Luck. They are criminal companies that make money and dont give a flying rats A$$ about you or science. They just want money and power.
0/0	So you want to change me genetically? NO thanks. Drugs are some times tested for years ,what this one 4 months No Thanks.
0/-1	So you're going 2 get the vaccine right. I want you to take live on YouTube
1	So you're saying that in terms of "freedom", there is no difference between having a choice, and not having a choice to take a vaccine? I am very much pro vaccine but I don't understand how you can say that mandatory vaccination is not a loss of freedom.
0/0	So your body constantly makes the spike.. Your immune system then attacks the spike... Isn't that going to lead to massive autoimmune diseases ???
0/0	So you‚Äôre gonna take something that‚Äôs 73% effective against a virus that has a 2% fatality rate ?????????? Uhhhhh
0	So ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶imma wait for y‚Äôall to take all three vaccines but so far I‚Äôm still scared to do so‚Ä¶‚Ä¶so bye
1/1	So, Dad‚Äôs now had his first dose of the vaccine!!....Mum‚Äôs turn tomorrow!!
1/1/1/1	So, I am in my late 40‚Äôs, due to my job, I‚Äôve had both my jabs already - Pfizer. Apart from a sore arm, I‚Äôve had no side effects at all. I can only speak from my own experience. All positive here. Feel lucky to have been vaccinated.
1/1	So, I just got an appointment to get my first Covid Vaccine! I get it on Saturday!! I'm excited and nervous about it. It's gonna feel great to be all vaccinated and everything.
0/0/0/0	So, I was wanting zombies from this virus. Maybe they'll come from the vaccine.
1/1	So, Pfizer vaccine side effects: nope, not me. Maybe a slight headache, but other than that, about 30 hours out, I feel fucking great!
1/0	So, according to anti-vacers, 930,000 doctors and over 800,000 pharmaceutical l scientist and lab techs are wrong.
0/0	So, according to this video (at 6:17) the DNA does get changed.
1/1	So, anyone who knows me knows I am very pro vaccinations. I have decided to lead by example and get vaccinated on Monday for Coronavirus so that I can better take care of my patients and serve my community!
1/1	So, are you saying the unvaccinated people dying in the streets of india of delta were faking it?
1/1	So, at the beginning of the pandemic, with no vaccine, these covidiots screwed everyone over by refusing to mask/quarantine/social distance. Now that there's a vaccine, they're making things even worse becoming breeding grounds for new variants
1/1/1/1/1/1	So, basically, there's a silver lining of Covid-19: It showed humanity that there's a faster way to create vaccines now, so future pandemics can be stopped earlier, thus saving millions or even billions of potential lives in the future generations to come.
1/1	So, here in Hungary we are not going to get enough of the pfizer, I would like to get pfizer/ moderna/oxford, but as a young person(non health care) I will only be able to get sputnik. If you are starving any food is good right ?
1/1	So, here's what I would say. Get the vaccination because A. the risks are smaller, but also B. It's in a controlled environment where scientists can continue to improve the formula. Covid is unpredictable because of variants in the wild.
0/0	So, how is it justifiable to force Americans to get this ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù for a disease with a 99.7% survival rate when the data show 80% of Americans had it & survived it with ‚Äúnatural immunity,‚Äù which the CDC showed is ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù to ‚Äúvaccinated immunity‚Äù? It doesn't make sense!
0/0	So, how is it justifiable to force Americans to get this ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù for a disease with a 99.7% survival rate when the data show 80% of Americans had it & survived it with ‚Äúnatural immunity,‚Äù which the CDC showed is ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù to ‚Äúvaccinated immunity‚Äù? It doesn‚Äôt make sense!
0/0	So, how long do you expect to feel like sugar in 6 months from now when getting the next shot ? And then again in 12 months when you get the next shot ..... I am quiet a bit older than you are, but I had nowhere near all the ‚Äûside effects‚Äú you had with the vaccine when I got infected by the c virus !!!!! I am convinced the secret is to boost ones immune system to the max to fight off any virus and NOT a badly tested, unproven, short lived vaccine !
0/0	So, if this vaccine is supposed to save everyone, why are people still having to wear masks, stay apart and not travel. What is the point of taking the vaccine? I'll never take it.
1/-1	So, if you don‚Äôt die from it, you think it‚Äôs ok. What about all those who have been sick for weeks or months? I am surprised that there are still people saying it‚Äôs like a cold or a flu.
0/1	So, just to clarify, if I get the virus I have a 99.75% chance of surviving it without any medical intervention. Those odds increase if I get hospital treatment. Furthermore, I will develop a natural immunity which will be far superior and adaptable to variants than any vaccine. The vaccine which is untested, the period of protection could be as little as 90 days. The vaccine which cannot stop me from getting and transmitting the virus. The vaccine which could give me numerous other unknown side effects. And just to top it off I could die of a blood clot? Thanks for your offer... I'm fine! Keep your vaccine!
0/0	So, no liability for Pfizer. That is telling you how this vaccine is safe.
0/0	So, we are being used as Guinea pigs.
1/1	So, why does all of this matter? Because of this chart. Covid‚Äôs IFR in England has fallen steeply since last winter, but that wasn‚Äôt by chance, it was [largely] because of vaccines. In countries with poor vax coverage, Covid will still be far more than twice as lethal as flu.
1/1	So... Some people believes that god will come down from heaven and cure everyone... it's been over 18 months now. Where is he? Yeah, I'll stick with my vaccine, thank you.
0/0	So... they know vaccine doesn't work the way it's supposed to but give it to them anyway? Wow... They have lost their doggone minds...
0/0	So.... bloodclots?
0/0	So.... the "truth" is, we still have a lot of unanswered questions
0/0	So...Getting the #COVID-19 vaccine... -Doesn't mean you can remove your mask -Doesn't mean you can stop social distancing -Doesn't mean we can end the lockdown -Doesn't make you immune to COVID-19 -Doesn't prevent you from getting COVID-19... So why get it?
0/0	So...the vaccine is safe BUT doesnt protect you from getting covid. How useless!
1/1	So? There is still value in getting vaccinated even knowing it's not 100% protection.
0/0	SoWhyAre the majority of hospitalizations vaccinated ppl? Riddle me that‚Ä¶
1/1	Social distancing measures, not the COVID-19 virus itself, have had the biggest negative impact on the economy. We need a vaccine
1/-1	Social distancing will be around until at least mid-2022. Manufacturing & distributing a vaccine to the entire species won‚Äôt happen in the next few months. We‚Äôll have to improve communications tech massively to keep everyone socially, emotionally, & psychologically fulfilled.
0/0	Social engineering 101: Step 1. Create a crisis Step 2. Keep people in a constant state of anxiety about the created crisis Step 3. Offer the people a solution to the anxiety in the direction you have engineered the herd to move towards
1/-1	Social media is already filling up with misinformation about a Covid-19 vaccine, months or years before one even exists.
0/0	Society, vaccination is need stop This is genocide‚Ä¶..
1/1	Solidarity, public spirit and Christian charity oblige us to protect life. The lives of others, too, not just our own.
0/0	Solution? Forget trying to influence your legislators. Boycott all pediatricians! Simple and effective.
1/1	Some anti vaxer said ‚Äúlet me guess your still in school‚Äù I said ‚Äúyeah because I am vaccinated‚Äù I can‚Äôt wait for their reply
1/1	Some are still dumb enough to think Covid is a hoax. 900,000 dead Americans know it is not a hoax but very real and deadly for those who least expect it. So many who refused to get vaccinated for a variety of idiotic reasons are now 6ft under and didn't need to be...sad!
1/1	Some good news regarding long term duration of vaccines preventing the worst outcomes of covid.
1/1	Some good news, my 95-year-old Grandma got her vaccine today. She said it didn't hurt, but then again Grandma is way tougher than me
1/1	Some good vaccine news today. Moderna says its vaccine was more than 90% effective at protecting against Covid-19 six months after the second dose.
1/1	Some high risk people can't get the vaccine due to being allergic to the ingredients and things like that. So their "protection" comes from most other people not being able to spread it to them because they're vaccinated. That's what we mean by herd immunity. High risk people who can't get the vaccine are protected by the immunity of the herd.
1/1/1/1	Some measures need to be forced.
0/0	Some more propaganda for your feed.
1	Some of are you so pessimistic. It's a little bit of hope in the world. Perhaps it may not work, but we will see. No need to trash to the minds who are working day and night to create a safe vaccine for all us.
1/1	Some of our friends took the shoot and they are fine!! I am going to take it too!!
1/1	Some of the anti-vax people I know have put far, far more dangerous and sketchy things in their body but self awareness isn't the strong suit
1/1	Some of these answers are deeply concerning. How will we convince our patients to get this vaccine with attitudes like these? I could understand it if there was actual data relating to safety concerns, but these ascientific comments about zombies and guinea pigs are wild. I would get the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine without hesitation.
0/0	Some of us are immune to your lies
0/0	Some of us have not been brainwashed
0/0/0/0	Some of us would like to keep our minds, body‚Äôs and souls thank you
0/0	Some of us would like to keep our minds, body‚Äôs and souls thank you üíú
0/0	Some of yall gonna have 8 shots in ya by the end of next summer and still be catching it. I know I know at least we aint being hospitalized and dying. That's a lie also
1/1	Some of you feel the need to proclaim to the world that you don't want the vaccine. We really don't care. It's better for the world if you don't take it. Survival of the fittest. Bye Felicia.
0/0	Some one told me cancers is one of the side effects
0/1	Some parents, they refuse to do [COVID-9 vaccination] at all. Their sense is 'It's not going to happen to me or my family'. Or 'It will be mild in our kids, and the vaccines pose some risks.'
0/0/0/0	Some people are dying from the vaccine no one reporting
1/1	Some people are mocking people that have three doses of the vaccines and still testing positive for COVID. But from this study the immunity generated by 'natural' infection is mostly penetrated by the Omicron variant. It's about the changes in the virus.
0/0	Some people are still fighting to protect the system that is killing them, thinking they care about them and their health-they identify w/ their abuser, like a cult member. When you defend masks & vaccines, you are defending the system & that system is one based off of profits.
0/0	Some people are still getting COVID-19 after being vaccinated. Don‚Äôt trust this vaccine at all
1/-1	Some people are talking about some negative side effects, but I gotta say I've really enjoyed my upgrade from autism to super-mecha-autobot-autism. The 5G coverage is butt though
1/1	Some people don't deserve a platform. This virus has killed over half a million in the US alone. It's not a debate.
1/1	Some people have a allergic reaction to vaccines, but it doesn't mean all vaccines are not save for all people. I am frutose intolerant, but I don't say fruits aren't healthy for people.
0/0	Some people have died from this vaccine. A lady fainted and died from it
0/0	Some people have seen claims that large numbers of people are getting seriously ill from the vaccine, that the risks of the vaccine aren‚Äôt being reported, or that officials know there are long-term risks but are keeping them secret.
0/0	Some people just say the vaccine helps because the creators say so and that people DON‚ÄôT DO RESEARCH. So no, I won‚Äôt take it‚Ä¶
0/0	Some people might not want to be injected by a drug that has been rushed through and with out knowing what s in the vaccine
0/0	Some people really prefer to get shots that make you sick every 4 mos?
0/0	Some people think for themselves and would rather take their chances after 10 months of still being alive by NOT participating in rushed and untested vaccine. Like, duh
1/1	Some people were going to die from other reasons even if they didn't take the vaccine.
1/1	Some people, including me, believe the vaccine may give them an opportunity to live without Covid-19. So... anti-vaxers, mind your own business and leave people to make their own decisions. A bunch of nit wits
0/0	Some recipients have died from the vaccine..and some with certain health issues are discouraged from getting the vaccine
0/0	Some recipients have died from the vaccine..and some with certain health issues are discouraged from getting the vaccine.
0/0	Some recipients have died from the vaccine..and some with certain health issues are discouraged from getting the vaccine. But I guess something is better than nothing...but I think I'll wait a little bit longer.
1/0	Some recipients have died from the vaccine..and some with certain health issues are discouraged from getting the vaccine. But I guess something is better than nothing...but I think I'll wait a little bit longer. üòé
0/-1	Some side effects from vaccination include chills, fever, sore arms and muscle aches for a brief period of time.
1/-1	Some still believe covid-19 is a hoax..
0/0	Some think especially in the West that everyone should be repeatedly vaccinated, but such forced vaccinations actually weakens everyone in the future. It is no surprise that many succumb to new variants and viruses in Europe and USA - unlike in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Natural immunity is generally still the best immunization if you have a strong body
0/0	Some vaccines do help, but a vaccine developed and researched in only a matter of weeks. Surprised you keep promoting the covid vaccine. If you want to be a guinea pig that is your choice, but quit encouraging others to do so.
0/0	Some?? Try 10s of thousands. This is month old news. Not even frontline workers want to be poisoned. Says a lot.
1/1	Somehow antivaxers believe in coincidences, how do they explain that polio is virtually nonexistent in countries with the highest rate of polio vaccine? It‚Äôs just that they won‚Äôt admit it.
0/0	Someone can have mine.......
0/0	Someone close to me had a stroke 2 weeks after receiving the vaccine. She also developed petechiae spots on her skin.
0/0/0/0	Someone died after injecting vaccine
0/0	Someone else can have mine I really don‚Äôt mind.
0/0/0	Someone else can have mine.
0/0	Someone just died after receiving the vaccine in placer county
1/1	Someone lives with asthma successfully for forty years, then catches covid and dies, and anti-vaxxers want you to believe she died ‚Äúwith‚Äù covid, not ‚Äúof‚Äù covid. It‚Äôs a garbage talking point to support a garbage position.
0/0	Someone needs three years to realise that this is not about a pandemic
1/1	Someone was asking the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine. Well, I can categorically tell you that all WHO and CDC-approved COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective!
0/0/0/0	Someone who doesn't want to be injected with an untested drug is not an antivaccine activist. He or she is just a sensible person.
0/0	Something about this vaccine that makes me feel uneasy idk why
0/0/0/0/0	Something big is going to happen soon.. I am not taking that shit ok.
0/-1	Something is NOT RIGHT about this vaccination crap
0/0	Something is not right. They have not seen the data of the side effects but they are advertising the vaccine already.
0/0	Something just feels so wrong about this vaccine‚Ä¶
1/1	Something like 8 billion doses of the Covid vaccine have been given worldwide. Anyone who says ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know all the side effects‚Äù is just being obtuse.
0/-1	Something tells me this "survey" was asked to about 6 people.
0/0	Something that is safe shouldn‚Äôt be mandatory.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	Something that is safe shouldn‚Äôt be mandatory. Wakeup people
0/0	Something that is safe shouldn‚Äôt be mandatory. Wakeup people.
1/1	Something we have been hearing in my area is that people are not going even if they qualify because they think others have a greater need than them. Don‚Äôt do this! If you currently qualify, go ASAP! Some of the major clinics near us have plenty of doses but not enough arms. They want and need you to go now.
1/-1	Sometimes I feel like the only education that 30% of the people in this country is through twitter and conspiracy theorists in youtube. Not everyone wants to control you!
0/0	Sometimes I feel like the vaccines are only about money
1/-1	Sometimes I'm feeling that freedom is a double edge sword.
1/1	Sometimes I've heard people, people I care about, say, 'if I'm faithful, God's gonna take care of me.' What I would hope they might consider is that maybe a vaccine is a part of God's plan.
0/0	Sometimes sooner... so far 23 people died as a consequence of being vaccinated in Norway alone.
1/1	Sometimes vaccines won't protect you, same with eating veggies and excersising everyday won't ensure you live a long, happy life. But it does help.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	Sometimes you just can feel where something is not right and that most definitely includes this Vaccine
0/-1	Somewhat, same has been said with the CV19 jab. Yet, current CV19 jabs can't completely neutralise SCV2.
0/-1	Soo many people lining up to join the cult
0/0	Soo the vaccines don't work, and you are at risk of complications when you take them, but, take them anyway. Thanks for your expert opinion.
0/0	Soo......it is a test vaccin....:))) Go to Hell with this vaccin.....
0/0	Soon Zombie Nation to arrive!
1/-1	Soon have Our Novavax to use but its reserves for UK citizens sorry Ursula
0/0	Soon so many variants and vaccines and then we will have to wear 5 layered masks. When does the madness end. Please stop the madness.
1/-1	Soon there will be anti vaxxer refugees....looking for countries that do not enforce pandemic vaccines.
0/0	Soon they are going to force us by taking away more and more of our normal lives when we refuse.
0/0	Soon we‚Äôll all be able to file class action lawsuits against platforms which prohibit our free speech against vaccines!
1/1	Sooner or later, the coronavirus hits us all. If you are vaccinated, at worst you will be flat at home for a few days and not in intensive care.
1/1	Sooo happy for you.. glad you went with vaccination
0/0	Sooo why are they trying to shove a vaccine down our throat if they don‚Äôt know if it works?
1/1	Soooo sickened & sad to see these unvaxxed/unboosted in our ICUs still 2+ years out‚Ä¶& their unrealistic families ‚Ä¶signed, a 34+ yr CC veteran‚Ä¶God love my full time colleagues who‚Äôve dealt with this devastation incessantly the past two+ years‚Ä¶God speed to our new grads who‚Äôve known nothing BUT this ugliness among patients‚Ä¶& their unrealistic fams‚Ä¶

0/0	Sorry I regret getting the vaccine. I‚Äôm not a healthy person but got the vac just for that reason. EVERY symptom I had before was amplified. Even after a week of my first shot I can barely get out of bed and my anxiety is out of control. My body feels like it‚Äôs dying and who knows maybe it is but I didn‚Äôt feel this bad until I took the vac. Just be warned.
0/0	Sorry but I'm one of those selfish people that won't take that vaccine. Personal choice. Never been sick.
0/0	Sorry but I‚Äôm not gonna get 3+ shots just to still get the disease, I don‚Äôt get my flu shot for the same reason
1/1	Sorry but at the end of the day these people have 2 choices, have the vaccine and feel slightly unwell for a couple of days, or reject it and risk severe illness or even death. I know what my choice is when my turn comes!!
0/0	Sorry but id rather just get covid straight up injected into me
0/0	Sorry christy, but NO THANKS. You keep it and you take it
1/1	Sorry for the antivaxxer family‚Äôs loss, but it is very interesting to watch natural selection happening so quickly in real time.
1/1	Sorry id rather listen to professional scientists professors not a layman whos blinded by whats really happening ,
0/0	Sorry if I don't wanna be part of the experiment
1/1	Sorry it doesn‚Äôt work like that. I have a few family members who are not vaccinated. They have had Covid several times. Also they keep giving it to everyone. It‚Äôs just a fact get the vaccine and help yourself and everyone else.
0/0/0/0/-1	Sorry no vaccines here for me and my family not happening were passing on it won't be no side affects here were not taking it üëç
0/0	Sorry that I'm not afraid of something that has a 99% survival rate.
0/0	Sorry this vaccine about a virus that‚Äôs still not known enough is complete crap!! The flu vaccine is only 67% after how many years?? With a 98.9% recovery rate I‚Äôll take my chances.
0/0	Sorry to be blunt. All news channels are are full of sensationalist bollocks.
0	Sorry to hear about your situation, but he/she is correct. Being vaccinated doesn't stop you from catching or spreading the virus. Here is an idea - you can wear a chemsuit when someone visits. Prior to taking the suit off, open up all of the windows to circulate fresh air and hopefully remove any lingering COVID aerosols in the house.
1/1	Sorry to report that chances of myocarditis is infinitely higher with Covid than from the vaccine. And natural immunity has shown to wane during the Omicron surge with millions of reinfections. But keep listening to the crackpots and liars so you feel better about yourself
0/0	Sorry you had to take a vaccine for a disease that doesn‚Äôt exists. It is a bunch of generic symptoms that can be attributed to any disease that have been given a new name.
0/0	Sorry your vaccine is not safe
0/0	Sorry! I too am in the medical field but will NOT be running out to get this pushed through vaccine. I will wait to see how this all plays out. Too many uncertainties.
0/0	Sorry, but NO THANKS. You keep it and you take it
1/1	Sorry, i wish i could but we‚Äôre in Pakistan, where the term ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù regarding COVID doesn‚Äôt exist because our govt is waiting for ‚ÄúFREE STUFF‚Äù from you and any other country. So if you have any leftovers, please do give it us!
1/1	Sorry‚Ä¶ not sorry! Sick of people being so selfish! They infect people they can‚Äôt get vaccinated‚Ä¶ kids!!!
1/1	Sort of, but even if vaccines don't stop infections, they will cut down the amount of time they are replicating. Fewer replications before being cleared greatly reduces the speed of mutations arising.
0/0	Sounds impressive, BUT No Thank You!
0/0	Sounds like a deadly killer vaccine
1/1/1	Sounds like a great vaccine I am excited about it. Since my children have asthma problems.
0/0	Sounds like herd immunity will be here long before the vaccine - Also typically the virus mutates to have even milder symptoms than it does already to the extent that a vaccine is pointless.
0/0	Sounds like one is playing the Russian rulet when choosing to take the vaccine
1/1	Sounds like the vaccine did exactly what it's supposed to do. Keep you from becoming seriously ill. What's the problem?
0/0	Sounds more like indoctrination centers!!
0/0/0/0/0	Sounds to me like the beginning of planet of the apes
0/1	Sounds too good to be true this vaccine is a placebo üòÇ
1/0	Sounds wonderful, the caution comes when we have no data to tell us of the long term effects of the vaccine, I am talking years decades. now if you are elderly it's not a big issue, (how long do you have anyway), but for a young person?? seems risky.
0/0	South Africa had a low vax rate and went through Omni just fine. Vax was good for Alpha and Delta, but doesn't seem useful or necessary for Omni.
1/1	South Korea is in the midst of a major Omicron new case surge, with 86% of its population 2-shot vaccinated, 54% boosted, and other mitigation efforts. Their suppression of severe disease outcomes to date is impressive
1/1	South Korean Catholics express solidarity with Pope Francis‚Äô appeal for a vaccine-sharing campaign for poor countries that are unable to get life-saving Covid-19 vaccines.
1/1/1	Speaking as someone who works in pharma and has worked closely with these vaccines, I appreciate your support in science!
0/0	Speaking of spreading misinformation, you do know that it literally has no measurable effect on transmission whether or not you‚Äôre vaccinated, right?
1/1	Speed up vaccination in the whole world
1/1	Spend a day in a full ICU, talk to the nurses, doctors, respiratory therapists, pulmonologists, find out how many patients are vaccinated. Read about variants & how they're an unknown & a race against time. Stop whining & don't simplify your argument to fit your narrative.
1/1	Spending in the UK has fallen. Vaccines should help the UK economy recover rapidly later this year.
1/1	Spike proteins are totally harmless, and have no negative effects whatsoever. It does not cause any harm too you, completely safe :)
0/0	Spike proteins damaged him internally. Oh wait, I'm just an old retiree that isn't qualified to comment. NO SHOT FOR ME!!!

1/1/-1	Start telling the truth about where the virus came from and maybe people will understand why it is serious...
0/1	Start to depopulation just like gate and he's father wants is all documentaled stop watching tv
1/1	Start vaccinating any and all who are willing. We always change the flu shot to adhere to newest strains, waivers could be signed and let science lead us!! We can't let let politics get intertwined.
0/0	Started my vaccine the other day due to workplace mandate. Will never agree with it, and I think people should always be allowed to make their own risk vs benefit decisions.
1/1	Stat of the Day: Between 2 January and 24 September, the age-adjusted risk of death involving Covid-19 was 32 times greater for unvaccinated people than fully vaccinated individuals. Source: ONS
0	States are removing healthy unvaccinated kids from school. Healthy Kids who have not been injected with Hep B are out. Kids with actual Hep B stay in. If the healthy kid gets actual Hep B, they can go back in & are protected by confidentiality. Still think it‚Äôs about health?
0/1/0	States without mask mandates don't need vaccinations!
1/0	Statistically I00% of people who drink water die

1/1	Stay strong. Praying for you to recover. Don‚Äôt listen to the idiots! The vaccine in most cases prevents death from COVID and helps u from getting it at all. No one said you couldn‚Äôt get sick it‚Äôs just that the possibility is so much smaller if vaccinated. They don‚Äôt get that!
1/1	Staying at home while the vaccine is rolled out has made all the difference. The number of new COVID-19 infections in Barking and Dagenham has decreased dramatically in recent weeks. New daily infections are at a two-month low. Together we are keeping our community & NHS safe.
0/0	Step 1 Get vaxxed. Step 2 Get boosted. Step 3 Catch Covid. Step 4 Go to step 1.
0/0	Step 1. Patent Virus. Step 2: Patent Vaccine Step 3: Pay China to mutate and modify virus. Step 4: Release Virus.

1/1	Super clear to understand n definitely gonna have to get the vaccine asap.^^
1/-1	Super helpful and informative. I've read articles about the difference between AstraZeneca vaccine and Jassen, only to realize they function the same. Several online news websites still deem, or at least make it sounds like, AstraZeneca uses the traditional harmless weakened version of common flu in chimps, as opposed to using Covid's spike DNA in a chimp-derived adenoviral vector. Thanks again, Vox, also for the great animation.

0/0	Support for Christine Cotton who shows the flaws in the Pfizer vaccine clinical study. It is important to explain how this vaccine, which was initially sold as 95% effective, turned out to be very poor. As a result, she has become the new target of harassment.

0/0	Sure but you can't just force a vaccination on people, especially if they are already against it
1/1	Sure didn't want to miss seeing the Inauguration yesterday, but my personal celebration was keeping my appointment to get the Covid vaccine instead. Then today my 96-year old aunt called from her assisted living residence, finally feeling like talking as she's fighting Covid, but she's beginning to improve. They have been on lockdown since the beginning and have only recently had Covid cases. Her best friend at the facility was buried today and she was feeling low. We cheered each other up, counting blessings. Times are hard for everyone, but if you still love this precious gift of life: Get the shot when offered.

0/0	Surprised to even find this, but then again im on duck duck go. Be prepared for people to call you crazy for preaching the truth. The vaccine wasn't rolled out for covid rather covid was rolled out for the vaccine. They've had it all along they just needed the perfect crisis
0/0	Surrender 100% of your humanity for something with around a less than 1% chance to affect you. Their numbers. All from a "deadly virus" you need to have an unreliable high false positive test not specifically designed to detect this 99% survival "virus"
1/1	Survivable or not, everyone who gets Covid has long term side effects. The research behind MRNA vaccines is decades old. I took a safe, proven vaccine to a dangerous pandemic after doing my research. You‚Äôre a shell account created less than a year ago to spread fear and lies.

1/1	THANK YOU for your "vaccinate the world" message! It's so important. I live in the US, I'm young and healthy. I did not get a booster. Other people need those shots more than I do.

I wish we quit worrying about the handful of anti-vaxxers in rich nations and bring the vaccines where they can do the most good.

0/0	THIS IS ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING. VACCINES USE LABARATORY ABORTED BABY FETAL MEAT TO CREATE A GENETICALLY MODIFIED MRNA TO INJECT IN EVERYBODY WHO BELIEVES THIS SICK LIE. THE VIRUS WAS CREATED IN A LAB IN WUHAN LABAROTORY INI 2009, WHERE PFIZER BUILT A LAB IN 2009 NEXT TO THE WUHAN LABAROTORY. PFIZER BUILDS FACITILY IN WUHON CHINA IN 2009 BEFORE COVID HIT http://www.pharmatimes.com/news/pfizer_to_build_r_and_d_facility_in_wuhan,_china_984211 THEY ARE USING SACRIFICIAL REMNANTS OF BABY FETAL MEAT! YUCK! THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE ACCEPTING INTO YOUR BODY, AND YES, THIS AFFECTS YOUR SPIRITUAL SOUL BECAUSE YOU ARE MAKING EXCUSES! SAYING THIS IS OKAY AND IT IS NOT WRONG. YOU ARE ACCEPTING A MATERIAL CREATED FROM BABIES THAT WERE KILLED. FOR THE PURPOSE OF WHAT???? SCIENCE??? EEW. THESE VAXXED PEOPLE ARE ACCEPTING A TERRIBLE WICKED SOURCE "VACCINE" INTO THIER BODIES AND DEFYING THEIR MORAL COMPASS AND BELIEFS, ALLOWING A BABY KILLING PROUD POWERFUL CORPORATION TO INJECT NASTY WICKED MATERIAL INTO YOUR BODY! AND YOUR SOUL WILL REFLECT WHAT YOU CHOOSE TO DO WITH YOUR BODY. TIMES ARE NEARING THE NEXT FLOOD OF THE EARTH. AS A CHRISTIAN, I STAND FIRM AGAINST WHAT IS WRONG. I BELIEVE IN THE LIGHT! AND LIFE! I DO NOT SUPPORT DEATH AND A SPIRIT OF GREED CORPORATE MONEY TO RULE THE LIVES AND CHOICES OF THE PEOPLE ON THIS EARTH. WE ARE LOVED BY GOD. DONT LET THESE CORPORATE LIES AND POLITICS SWAY YOUR ROOT IN JUDGEMENT. YOU KNOW WHAT IS RIGHT, AND THIS VACCINE IS NOT A VACCINE. IT IS ABORTED FETAL MEAT USED TO MAKE YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM WEAKER.OBVIOUSLY NOT A CATHOLIC BEACUSE GOD SAYS SACRIFICING BABIES IS WHY NOAH WAS CHOSEN AND SPOKEN TO BY AN ANGEL TO SAVE ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD TURN FROM SIN BEFORE THE FLOOD OF THE EARTH. THEIR BABY SACRIFICING RITUALS IN NOAHS DAY WERE BABIES SACRIFICED AND GIVEN TO GOLD STATUES THAT WERE NOT AN ALTER TO GOD HIMSELF BUT TO THEIR SELFISH WAYS OF WORSHIPPING SIN AND DEATH INSTEAD OF LIFE HE CREATED. THIS SACRIFICIAL BABY KILLING IS CALLED ABORTION, THE CREATERS OF THE CORPORATE ABORTION CLINICS ARE SICK PEOPLE WITH LOTS OF MONEY WHO GET OFF ON USING BABY FETAL MEAT TO MAKE THEMSELVES LOOK YOUNGER USING GENETICALLY MODIFIED MATERIALS FROM BABIES.T?HIS MAN BELOW WRITING THIS ARTICLE IS NOT A CATHOLIC AND NEITHER IS THE POPE. THEY ARE IMMITATORS WITH POWER AND MONEY GREED SELFISHNESS AND THEIR BEHAVIOR IS WWWRRROOONNGGG.SOURCEhttps://www.nebraskamed.com/COVID/you-asked-we-answered-do-the-covid-19-vaccines-contain-aborted-fetal-cells AS THE POPE QOUTES "As a practicing Catholic, I think the moral balance of indirectly benefitting from an abortion that occurred 50 years ago in order to take a vaccine that will prevent further death in the community is a no-brainer ‚Äì especially considering that so many of the over 620,000 American deaths have occurred in the most vulnerable and marginalized in our society. We need to focus on saving lives right now. We need to care for our neighbors. The Vatican and bishops agree. The Vatican has issued clear guidance that permits Roman Catholics in good faith to receive COVID-19 vaccines that use fetal cell lines in development or production" ITS OK TO USE MURDERED BABY MEAT AND INJECT IT INTO PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD??? WAKE UP PEOPLE WE ARE IN THE DAYS OF THE SECOND COMING, GOD SAID IN THE PROPHECY OF THE HOLY BIBE THERE WILL BE "PESTILENCE" ( THAT MEANS EPIDEMIC) BEFORE HE RETURNS AGAIN , AND NEXT TIME WONT BE A FLOOD, IT WILL BE BY FIRE! MAKE SURE YOUR SOULS ARE IN THE "RIGHT" PLACE" DONT EXCUSE EVIL FOR BEING GOOD. IT IS WRONG WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE OKAY! IT IS NOT OKAY! WHETHER YOU TOOK THE VACCINE OR NOT! MAKE SURE YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU JUST PUT IN YOUR BODY IS EVIL, AND YOUR FLESH REFLECTS YOUR CHOICE, AND YOUR SPIRIT RELECTS YOUR CHOICE. IT IS ALL A CHOICE. AND TURN AROUND AND REALIZE THE LORD LOVED YOU! YES YOU. THERE IS NO WAY YOU CAN LOVE GOD, BECAUSE HIS LOVE IS GREATER THAN YOURS. LET HIS LOVE SHINE IN YOUR LIFE, AND CHOOSE LIFE! NOT THE WORLDS WAYS OF SIN AND DEATH AND MURDEROUS ACTS ON DISECTING MURDERED BABY FETAL MEAT AND ALLOWING THIS TO BE SHOVED UPON YOUR SPIRIT BODY AND SOUL. TURN AWAY FROM THE WORLDLY SIN SERVING OTHERS AS YOUR MASTER AND IDOLIZING MATERIALS AS YOUR WICKED GOD, AND TRY AND RECOGNIZE THE LORD IS THE ONLY TRUE POWER IN THIS WORLD. HIS LOVE IS GREATER.

0/0	THIS is not a 'vaccine' in the common sense of the word ... this changes your DNA ....offering control to the elites over your health ! Your immune system will not work as it should ... very definitely NOT about a virus" As for passports to travel ... there has never been a vaccine above 50% PROVEN efficacy ... never mind safety ! The present flu shot on gov.uk is given as an ESTIMATED 45% efficacy ... we have data that indicates MUCH lower ...so what's the point of that! The Russians have begun covid 'vaccinating' ... but only to hospital staff who have HAD covid ( it was on RT) .... the very people who already HAVE built in immunity and so they can say its a 90% efficacy!!! Covid ...Certificate of Vaccine ID! So many lies !!!

0/0	Take fresh herbs they are all antiviral and stop worrying..The reason they wish so many vaccinated is to eliminate the control group. Yes, I do believe we can improve our immune systems functions of working to protect us. I just disagree with the methods used and imposed upon us. Vaccinations are toxic by their ingredients and cause an inflammatory response and in some cases can knock the immune system well off kilter. Building health with fresh herbs that are antimicrobial and antiviral, antibacterial etc, has no such issues. Mother nature has all the kindness, mans science has all the cut burn and poison. Which many of us now are trying to recover from.

0/0	Take your shots and shove them. Stop people are not test rats. Now your going after the kids. Sick. Really the media Script readers need a lot of praying for. Bill nine the lieguy with a bow tie told us we live on a spinning ball and that‚Äôs a lie and now the vaccines. What a joke
0/0	Take your shots. I like my immune system instead

1/1	Take your vaccines, they will protect you.
0/0	Takes MRNA (Murder Right Now Anthony) to a whole new level. Also goes to show how pussified and stupid people are. They have been driven into a state of morbid fear (of absolutely nothing) to the point where they will stand in line, in the middle of the night, to get injected with a human pesticide containing an IGR, just so this poison doesn't go bad. Pure Darwin at work here. These pussified sheep will make the ultimate contribution to the gene pool. They'll remove themselves from it.
0/1/0/0	Taking Bill Gates vaccine lmao
0/1	Taking a look at the infection rate here in Germany, all time high, it's obvious that the vaccine needs a little upgrade or that we accept that this virus won't go away. For the sake of everyone. I hope this doesn't come off as insensitive, this whole situation is just genuinely mind boggling to me. Very complex and difficult situation...
1/0	Taking a vaccine is the price we pay for living in a modern society.
1/1/1	Taking anyone‚Äôs appointment who doesn‚Äôt want it ü•∞
0/0	Taking part in a medical trial invalidates life insurance and other insurance based on life insurance .... so the vaxxed cant: drive, travel, operate machinery, hold positions of authority or responsibility, get a loan, own firearms, enter security buildings, hold security clearance, buy a house, sign legal papers, be voted into politics ..... as they lose capacity .....ooppps.
1/1	Taking part in the Janssen vaccine trial on Tuesday, really excited to get the opportunity to help out.
0/0	Taking the pill doesn't cause autoimmune disease. This vaccine is causing blood clotting due via autoimmune disorders. So, it's very likely that this is just the tip of the iceberg. Autoimmune disorders may take years to manifest.
0/1	Taking the pill has far higher cases of thrombosis associated with it.
1/1	Taking the vaccine and having bad side effects far outweighs catching the virus and falling ill. Plus it‚Äôs been a tough 18 months for everyone, I got vaccinated to help end this real life horror movie we‚Äôve all been living through.
0/0	Taking the vaccine doesn't give any guarantee you are protected against Covid.
0/1	Taking the vaccine in exchange for the hope on an easier progression of the illness is like cutting off your leg to avoid the athletes foot

1/1	Taking your chances on catching Covid? And then maybe passing it along to 5 other people who don't want to take their chances and are waiting hoping for vaccine? And maybe dying or getting permanent lung damage? Taking that chance too? Not getting the vaccine is stupid

0/0	Talk til you are blue in the face...I AM NOT TAKING THAT DAMN VACCINE
1/0	Talk to me all you'd like, I will not voluntarily take the vaccine. It should be a choice, like getting a flu shot, which I have also never had. If you want the vaccine, then you should have easy access to it.
1/0	Talk to me in 5 or 10 years. Anyone who takes an unnecessary vaccine with unknown long-term term effects for a virus with a 99+% survival rate is a fool
0/-1/0	Talk to me like a normal person but I'm still not getting the flu shot,I mean covid-19 shot
1	Talked to my pcp, GI, and infectious disease specialist all whom said vaccine is safe with my condition and with the medications I‚Äôm on. Hope it helps!
1/1	Talking a shot takes a couple minutes and isn't terribly painful. Its the waiting that's annoying, yes, but I still don't get why people act like having to go get a shot is any different than going to the dentist or getting a check up. You take one day out of your oh-so precious time to see about your health then go on with your life. I guess they don't see dentists either...
1/0	Tamil Actor vivek died today because of Corona vaccine Side effects : Cardiac arrest
1/-1	Tbf even though I'm pro vaccine, the first thing that would come to my mind would be if it killed someone to took it a week prior.
1/1	Tbh I‚Äôd MUCH rather get bad arthritis in my hands than to lose all my limbs from not getting a vaccine, but that‚Äôs just me
0/0	Tbh I‚Äôm not sure if I want one. Everything is done in such a hurry that I don‚Äôt believe it won‚Äôt have any side effects
1/1/1/1	Teacher over here Our district scheduled us to get the first round of the Pfizer vaccine on Thursday. Couldn't be more thrilled to be one step closer to having our students back in the classroom!

0/0	Tell me how putting DNA or mRNA into our bodies help?? Makes absolutely no sense.
1/1	Tell me the time and date of my vacation and I‚Äôm there!
0/0	Tell me then...why are autoimmune diseases on the rise? Our bodies are attacking themselves because there is so much pollution in the atmosphere, and it's all going into our systems. The amount of vaccines we're giving our kids, and ourselves is over the top. Sometimes you need to pick and choose your poison I guess.
1/1	Tell me to my face that my four year old is just going to have give up another birthday party because you heard something bad about AZ on Facebook. And that you deserve Moderna more than the people for whom AZ presents an actual increased risk.

0/0	Ten years from now they‚Äôll be saying ‚ÄúIf you took the COVID vaccine you may be entitled to compensation‚Äù times are different now. They put strange stuff in our food and our vaccines that they didn‚Äôt when my grown children were young.
1/1	Tens of thousands of brave, healthy people around the world agreed to participate in these clinical trials. Over 90% effectiveness compared to people who didn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs frankly great. It will honor their participation to follow‚Äîand keep us from getting sick

1/0	Tens of thousands of people who have convictions for drug offences, fraud, dishonesty, assault, football hooliganism etc etc will soon find their future horizons are very limited, incl being barred from foreign holiday destinations, once Covid controls have been lifted.
0	Tentative good news. Vaccine being tested in China is showing the hoped for results so far, it produces antibodies in people who receive it and does not have bad side effects. It can move on to next step in trials with more people and see if these antibodies are effective at creating immunity to virus.
0/0	Terrible and horrible if vaccine is like russian roulette with your life. Normal time for create vaccine is 10 to 15 years.
0	Test humans first then the lab rats
0/0	Test it on public officials first. Preferably those close to the top. If it works, then we are good. But if not, then they gotta try making it again.
0/0	Test the vaccinated, jabs don't work
1/1	Tested positive for covid, take care everyone! Get vaccinated
1/1	Tested positive the 23 of December I got to spend new years with my mom and sister cause they got it too. Yesterday I tested negative, tomorrow will be my last day in quarantine. Go get vaccinated people thanks to that me and my whole family got mild symptoms.
1/1	Tested positive the day of my induction day with baby #3. That previous Sunday came down with nasty cold congestion and a little shortness of breath. Had dangerously low iron too which also contributed to my shortness of breath too was really scared. Wore a mask at home around my newborn and other 2 kids and husband. Husband was sick too. Congestion cough loss of taste and smell but we survived and kids were ok. Scary stuff. I have vaccines so lucky but still scary because lots of unknown with Covid and everyone is so different.
1/1	Tested positive this morning. My wife did last week. We‚Äôd absolutely still get it.
1/1	Tested positive, 5 days of terrible pain... from JordanüáØüá¥. Hope everyone is safe every where. Was about to book for a vaccine after I clear, but now I will wait 3 months. Thanks, Sir.
0/0	Testing an untested gene therapy drug on children sounds beyond stupid and evil. Since this minor pandemic began the "experts" have contradicted themselves many times. People cant be gullible and trust the so called experts like Bill Gates or Bill Nye. Or even Fauci who has changed his story a bunch of times.

1/1/1	Than what explanation is for those children who received vaccines and are fine? That some vaccines are tainted? And the lucky children had an untainted vaccine?
1/1	Thank God I've had my vaccine and booster so COVID isn't a death sentence for me like it is the un-vaxxed, but I still don't feel safe in public not knowing everyone's vax status.
1/1	Thank God and Pfizer and UC Health. I'm secure in the knowledge that I'm as protected as I can be with my two-shot regimen and my booster.
1/1	Thank God! when I get my jab, I will probably cry in relief and thankfulness.
0/0	Thank God, most of the people on this video are intelligent enough to not take an untested vaccine and by testing, the average vaccine takes 15-20 years, this vaccine is being pushed out in less than a year. No thank you!
1/1	Thank Science! It's finally happening. Happy, happy day. Long way to go but it's a start.
0/0	Thank You I use a Homeopath only. I don‚Äôt go to medical doctors. As a rule they don‚Äôt know how to cure a thing. Most never look at the cause, they only treat a symptoms and give no thought to what they do to the rest of the body. Therefore I use natural methods.
1	Thank You for taking the time to address this misinformation. I hope and pray that it will change the minds of some of the more gullible people, unfortunately so many people have completely turned their backs on science, and willingly embrace our former President and his ‚Äúalternate‚Äù facts.

0/0	Thank you @OANN for airing the panel of expert doctors and nurses telling us how dangerous the #CovidVaccine is. Everyone needs to watch this! And please keep the covid vaccine away from our children.
0/0	Thank you Christian. You have put into words what I want to say. Truthfully, I have not done the research, but what you have said is what I want my family to know. I have also had COVID and do not plan on getting the "shot" (I won't even call it a vaccine) at all.
1	Thank you Doctors. Hope it is successful and safe for humans and not become zombies as side effects.
1/1	Thank you Dr Hanson. That was very informative and helpful information. Will you keep us updated on progress with the Johnson and Johnson vaccine?

1/1	Thank you Dr, I'm still regretting not taking our booster shot before we went on vacation... husband, I, and my 7 yr old all got covid, ..thank God our 10 month old didn't show signs...but because we are vaccinated it didn't stay for long. And we didn't have severe symptoms. Just me because it became a cold/sinus infection . I wish I have gotten my booster in the first place because my Pfizer shot was from June. Anyway...lesson learned we are just nervous about our kids getting this especially my 10 month. Finding good kn95 masks for kids is so hard. I'm hoping her shot will be enough for her in school these last couple months.
0/0	Thank you Dr. Robert Malone for standing up with the people against vaccine!! Having a real scientist on our side is double meaningful...

1	Thank you Mr President for keeping your word to have vaccinations as quickly as possible for all those who want them. As one of the 1st to get the vaccine I know the relief that comes with being protected & I‚Äôm so happy that more & more are experiencing this relief
1/1	Thank you Nikki. Now if everyone else who is eligible would get their vaccinations, we could whip this virus and get back to (close to) normal.
1/1	Thank you Pfizer for saving the world your vaccine is the best

1/1/1	Thank you President Biden! Now if Americans could just care enough about the lives of other Americans to wear a mask until a great majority are fully vaccinated we could beat this nightmare virus.
1/1	Thank you President Biden. I am hoping that there will be a focus on vaccinating teachers, school support staff, students and parents prior to mandating that schools reopen within 100 days.

1/1	Thank you WHO For help human on the world.
1/1	Thank you again to the international science community for developing this vaccine. And a big thanks today to the UK's independent regulator for testing and approving its rollout. Proof that the UK can be world leading, when free from the interference of the political "leadership" and the awarding of contracts to unqualified cronies. Leave the rollout to the vaccination and logistics experts.

1/1	Thank you and everyone who worked endless hours to bring us this vaccine. God bless you all.
1	Thank you and glad you are getting some upvotes and awards for going against the anti-vax nonsense. I've been a conservative most of my life and was a T_D mod, but the anti-vax/mask crap I see in conservative circles sometimes drives me insane. Yes there are some risks associated with vaccines (that's why they do clinical trials after all) but they are tiny compared with the health risk posed by COVID: it's a no-brainer, especially with full FDA approval. Go get your shot if you haven't already (and put your mask on too while you're at it).
1/-1	Thank you both for your work you've done. You are appreciated.

0/0	Thank you for covering this. I found it amazing how similar the adverse vaccine affects she described are to Lyme disease symptoms.
0/0	Thank you for covering this. I have a history of allergic reactions and when I tell people why im hesitant on vaccination (for now) they just keep saying "you read too many conspiracies on the internet" but my concerns are legitimate.
1/1	Thank you for creating this vaccine.. they are saving so many lives im fully vaccinated and greatful
1/1/1/1/1/1	Thank you for creating this video. It's very frustrating to read all the anti vaccine comments all over the internet. Even here in Switzerland, where we supposedly have very good general education there's an alarming rise of people spreading misinformation.
1/1/1/1	Thank you for educating us! Please everyone get vaccinated as soon as it's your turn. It's the least we can do for our loved ones.
1/1	Thank you for explaining the MRNA vaccine!! It was so much more understandable when you broke it down. I‚Äôm getting the vaccine on Tuesday the 22nd since I‚Äôm considered a frontline worker. Many people I‚Äôve talked to in my community are worried to get it but with all the scientific information I‚Äôve read it is safe. I‚Äôm not scared at all. And I hope more people do their own research.
1/1	Thank you for explaining what is meant my ‚Äúrushing‚Äù the vaccine. I wish all news channels would take the time to explain this and help dispel ignorance and fear.

1/-1	Thank you for the breakdown....So many stupid conspiracy theory things out here.. I hope this helps people to realize that COVID is not a joke..
1/1	Thank you for the clarification. Other doctors have done the same. We can only hope that people understand the importance of the covid vaccine. For ages, vaccines have served us well.
0/0	Thank you for the detailed scientific explanation. Can we be assured this vaccination is perfectly safe? Can we really trust Pfizer/Big Pharma? Do you have complete trust in Pfizer and in the clinical trials? Personally, I have no trust in them. They are immune from liability lawsuits. I guess when you have that much money and power, you are untouchable.
1/1	Thank you for the easy to understand information on Covid and how vaccines work. Even for me at my 79 years young. Pity the antivaxxers, many of young ages cannot understand simple things!
1/-1	Thank you for the great info. My question is if the spike protein (created by our cell's ribosomes) are expressed on our own cells, wouldn't our immune system then attack our cells?
1/1	Thank you for the info I‚Äôm getting my vaccine in two weeks
1/1	Thank you for the neat breakdown. Hopefully, people will actually learn something for once from this and take the vaccine

1/1	Thank you for the vaccine against the covid 19. Thank you very much. Really the people need to be vaccinated. Mandatory vaccines in the United States airports. That's only way to vaccinate a lot of people. The vaccines are important to avoid diseases. Thank you. The airports need vaccines or everybody!!
1/1	Thank you for the vaccine!!!
1/1	Thank you for the vaccine!!!!
0/-1	Thank you for the video, however instead of COVID VAccine you should say/write Pfizer Vaccine because there is a big difference between Pfizer Vaccine and Oxford etc...
1/1	Thank you for these outcomes, they are very easy to understand. I hope more people take vaccination more into consideration.
1/-1	Thank you for this :)
1/-1	Thank you for this concise and informative discussion. I appreciate that you were able to simplify such a complex topic without glossing over its scientific basis. That is not always easy to do, but I have seen it consistently done in your many COVID presentations. I think MedCram provides the best science-based information on the internet for public consumption and have recommended you to nearly everyone I know.
1/1/1	Thank you for this honest review. I will now be well prepared to face any challenge my 2nd dose brings. ( I‚Äôm not interested in all the long term affects of Covid patients are reporting). No thanks; I‚Äôll take the vaccine!
1/1	Thank you for this information. It‚Äôs very informing. I am currently enrolled in the AstraZeneca vaccine trial. I have not yet received a vaccine or placebo.
1/1	Thank you for this video .. good presentation so people can understand.. just had my 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine , had a sore after and redness on the injection site but I was ok days after ... im a healthcare worker and high risk of getting infected so i need it ..
1/1	Thank you for this video, this cleared a lot for me. I was too thinking in terms efficacy rate and thinking that a vaccine should make invincible against Corona but I see a clear perspective here now! Take vaccine and avoid strong symptoms, hospitalisation and death!
1/-1	Thank you for this well-explained video. One question, do you know whether concerns about the impact of the vaccine on male/female fertility are warranted? Thank you again
1/1/1/1	Thank you for this! Going to share! Dr Seema perfectly articulates what I explained to my family and friends who naturally have reservations about the vaccine.
1/1	Thank you for this! I'm a young person, but I work with the public. I live in a rural area and my local health dept. has a standby list for vaccines that my boss signed me up for when she learned about it (she knew I'd want to be on it). I get the first of the Moderna vaccines tomorrow. I've never been excited to get a shot before, but I certainly am now!
1/1	Thank you for this, about to get the Pfizer tomorrow
1/1	Thank you for this. Hopefully it will bring a few people back from lunacy. The problem is that most people have forgotten how bad small pox and measles are. These are serious diseases!
1/-1	Thank you for this. It actually makes me curious about the COVID vaccines instead of being all skeptical.
1/1	Thank you for this. My college just made free J+J vaccines available to us (and I'm getting mine tomorrow), and I was concerned it might not be worth it, and was considering waiting to get a two-dose vaccine later. I feel better now about getting the Fauci Ouchy tomorrow!
1/1	Thank you for this. The vaccine is to help prevent the need for hospitalization, oxygen requirement or death. Even with the regular flu vaccine, one can still get the flu, but the symptoms should not be severe.
1/1	Thank you for trying. I still can‚Äôt convince my brother to get the vaccine because he thinks he has ‚Äúnatural immunity‚Äù to COVID-19. Despite the fact that I‚Äôm a nurse and on the front lines of this nightmare, he won‚Äôt budge
1/1/1	Thank you for vaccinating my 95 year old father who is in an assisted care facility. He got his 2nd shot one week ago and had zero side effects. So grateful and so hopeful.
1/-1	Thank you for your brilliance and making an additional deal with the United States for more vaccine
1/1	Thank you for your enormous work, so difficult in this moment. Vaccination is an act of civilization. We have to take care of each other.

0/0/0/0	Thank you for your service, I'm not planning to get the vaccine, I rather aquire immunity through infection. I think eventually we all will be getting it at some point.
1/1	Thank you for your work!!! Here‚Äôs to science!!
1/1/1/1	Thank you getting my first dose. Feel a lot better
1/1	Thank you god
0/0	Thank you ladies for standing up for bodily autonomy. It's the same for me. I won't be forced to put something into my body that I haven't seen to be proven safe or effective.

1/-1	Thank you oh woke white folk for coming into the black neighborhood and educating our brothas and sistas.
1/1	Thank you science and vaccines! The long wait is finally over.
1/1	Thank you science for ending this pandemic
1/1/1/1	Thank you scientists for working hard!
1/1	Thank you sir,it is very important to know about the vaccine details,by this people can understand vaccine is very important...to all of us..
1/1	Thank you so much Dr. med. Seheult for your education. üåº A user in the comment section reported that these mRNA-DNA vaccinations would work just like the dengue fever vaccination. Ask for clarification, thank you. üôè
1/1	Thank you so much for accepting me into this group. I had my first Pfizer vaccine last Friday, and look forward to doing a few more things thanks to medical science!
1/1	Thank you so much for actively taking part in stopping the spread of COVID-19
1/1	Thank you so much for pouring millions of dollars into your research to ensure your vaccine continually is safe and effective for all patients, Pfizer!! Your dedication is apparent with all the quality data that we are seeing
1/-1	Thank you so much for sharing this information, your knowledge with us
1/1	Thank you so much for this - beautifully clear! Do you know whether there have been any studies testing whether mixing vaccines is as effective and safe as dosing with a single vaccine?
1/1	Thank you so much for this informative video. I just had my first Pfizer shot at Walmart. Great experience!! They were awesome! No side effects so far. It‚Äôs been 2 days. Not happy to hear symptoms can sneak up after 10 days üò¨ and not looking forward to #2 but will do it and grateful to be protected. My daughter had both Pfizer doses and she only had a headache after #2.
1/-1	Thank you so much for this video I'll be sleeping better tonight
1/1	Thank you so much for this video! Without it, the vaccine was just a 'thing' with the face of a company being discussed politically. This made me feel more connected to the scientists behind its research. I really appreciate it.
1/0	Thank you so much for this video. As someone who has reactions to other vaccines (flu, etc.), I was nervous about this one (Pfizer) but I only had a immune response (and also some mild hives that I reported to v-safe). I studied the ingredients and I think it should be noted that the mRNA vaccines have no preservatives, heavy metals, or antibiotics which is by far the "cleanest" vaccine I've had (which probably helped with no adverse events, in my case). Also, since I'm a researcher in the sciences (benchwork and beyond), I already knew that the basic components disintegrate fairly fast so long-term effects from the vaccine itself is small. Please mention to individuals getting the vaccine that it's wise to layoff the anti-inflammatories, acetaminophen, and alcohol for about 48 hours prior to the jab to 72 hours post-jab. I know many people taking Aleve, etc. a few hours before their appointment in anticipation of the effects.. we want our immune system to be full-on during the vaccine process. A little discomfort is worth it for a day or so. Rarely do I hear doctors telling this sound advice. If ever we needed PSAs .. it's now.
1	Thank you so much for this wonderful video. Intelligent, informative and extremely clear and honest. Hopefully it will convince people who are worried about taking the vaccine to receive it.
1/1	Thank you so much for your excellent update. Stay safe!
0/0	Thank you so much still not taking it
0/0	Thank you so much to both of you for the info but I am not mentally ready to get the vaccine yet.
1/1	Thank you so much to the lovely doctor who did my second dose in Brackley Medical center yesterday and to all the staff who were very efficient though the line was a mile long everything was in order
1/1	Thank you so much, you just got me the best info about who can get the vaccine, I have hopes for my family
1/1	Thank you so much. I am shell-shocked because of so much unwarranted distrust of the people and systems in place to try to protect us. It's a "No good deed goes unpunished" situation, to a pathological degree. It is very hard to make sense of.
1/1/1/1	Thank you so much. I have a lot of friends who didn't want me to get that shot. All these reasons where brought up. I didn't have the best response. Now I do.
1/1	Thank you so much. My family is scared of getting the vaccine so I showed them this video and it really helped. "You fear what you dont know"
1/1/1	Thank you so much. Understanding the work of the vaccine really helped me. On target affects. Go science!
1/-1	Thank you soooooo much for sharing. I am so tired of people spreading these lies just to create fear. That is so cruel. I shared your post to one friend 3 times she needs to stop starting fires. With her untruth.
1/1	Thank you that you finally said something about side effects, more people are assured and want to take a vaccine
1/1	Thank you to President Trump for getting this vaccine before the end of last year and your governor for allowing you to receive it. Cannot wait to get mine.
1/1	Thank you to all of Pfizer scientists and employees for the vaccine to stop COVID. Just got my first dose last weekend.
1/1	Thank you to all the scientists and researchers around the world for making the vaccine available this early.
1/1	Thank you to all the scientists that have worked unceasingly to make this happen, even in the face of all the naysayers, You've come through with a vaccine. Well done.
1/1	Thank you to all the scientists who toiled long, long hours to make both positive and negative discoveries that got us to an effective vaccine. How lucky is the world today that some scientists did not chase the money/grants that are so necessary to survive as a research scientist, but decided to work in obscure fields that were not popular, so to speak. To those who say this vaccine is experimental, do they realize the discoveries began in 1960? Scientific studies, by definition, are experimental. That's what scientists do, experiment until they refine whatever it is they're working on. Proving a negative can be as helpful or more as proving a positive. And that this came together from several different sets of scientists studying different variations of coronavirus, mRNA etc. Society as a whole owes you all a great debt. Again, thank you.
1/1	Thank you to all these companies for doing the right thing. We all need to be vaccinated in order to prevent further variants and have this pandemic continue to rule our lives.
1/1	Thank you to our amazing scientists and those who took part in the trials.....wonderful news
1/1	Thank you to our amazing scientists, global partners, health officials, vaccine production workers Secretary Azar, VP Pence, and President Trump. An amazing accomplishment.
1/1	Thank you to the 85.2% vaccinated Canadians and ALL front-line workers keeping us going! These are the real patriots!
1/1	Thank you to the WHO for sharing this very informative video. I do hope many more will trust science and progress, and understand that vaccines are safe and they are the only way out of this pandemic.
1/1	Thank you to the companies, doctors, scientists, geneticists, and frontline workers that made this possible. A true achievement in human healthcare and logistics.
1/1	Thank you to the people who worked so hard, to get us a vaccine, I've had one injection just waiting for the second. Feel safer.
1/1/1/-1	Thank you to the researchers, collaborators, scientists and healthcare workers. Science saves lives, period.
1/-1	Thank you very much Dr John. I don't know what I'd do without all the updates you give. I hope we get some vaccines here in Egypt soon. Thanks again!
1/0	Thank you very much for the message, that we (anyhow/in the end) are doing something good for our world (also for the long term!)!
1/1	Thank you very much for this clear information and for your most valuable work. Vaccines are the only way to get rid of this pandemic
1/1	Thank you üòä tomorrow is my day for a vaccination! Grateful for the science üôè
1/1	Thank you! I feel sorry how your company was treated. You gave a vaccine at cost to the world but found just suspicion and EU tantrums. Keep up the good work AZ, hopefully history will make you right
0/1	Thank you! I got the vax to protect my grandma. Have been sick 8 days. Muscle weakness in my arms and legs. Doctor told me to get an MRI. Covid is a nightmare but this vaccine has been a nightmare for me too. There will be people like me who react in scary ways to the vaccine and were not making it up or acting crazy. Our suffering is real too. There‚Äôs no completely perfect solution to this pandemic and we should be free to discuss it intellectually.
1/1	Thank you! I hope y'all continue to stay as safe over there in California as possible, and that you are able get your vaccines when you're able to!
1/1	Thank you! you‚Äôve convinced me to get the shot. Getting it tomorrow
1/1	Thank you!!! This make sense. I always liked the science of the JnJ vaccine more than pfizer and Moderna (which are mRNA), but wasnt sure since the efficacy rate was so much lower. Whatever is offer to me, I will now take.
1/-1	Thank you!!!!!! My daughter is in a high risk group even though she‚Äôs only 14!! So many times, the media doesn‚Äôt think of people like us. We have been isolated for over a year to protect her. Thank you thank you thank you!!!!!!!
0/0	Thank you!Give my portion to someone else!I don't trust ur advertising HSE!Once you take full responsability of the negative effects of the vaccine,i am in,if not,keep it for yourself!
1/1	Thank you, Dr Kariko, Dr Weissman, and the entire Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna teams!
1/1	Thank you, Dr. Not coughing; but head and body aches. Instant test can catch it AFTER 24 hours. I'm vaccinated, but I hear we have it, too (San Diego, California, USA) and that's helpful information. So far, everyone here that caught Omicron is only mildly sick, hope it stays that way. We're usually looking for cough and fever, not head and body pain. I appreciate the heads up South Africa on different symptoms to look for. Very happy that vaccine companies are sending doses your way. We are in this together.
1/-1	Thank you, I was looking for this very thing- explained clearly, much appreciated.
1/1	Thank you, Rachel. I got the vaccine because I couldn‚Äôt carelessly cause someone harm. Whether it was a friend, family, or someone I disagree with or even dislike. Getting vaccinated shows a cohesion as Canadians to do the right thing.
1/1	Thank you, Science, for my 1st #CovidVaccine. With no sign of a 2nd dose in sight, I will continue to #WearAMask.
1	Thank you, but where to get them?
1/1	Thank you, doctor, for taking the time to give us the facts and even share your personal experience with the vaccine. I didn't know that there are more side effects from bp meds than the covid vaccine! It's because of this video that my husband and I have scheduled our first dose of Pfizer.
1/1	Thank you, for that verified information we have no choice but to believe and take it.
1/1	Thank you, had my vaccination yesterday. I am one of many that appreciates what you are doing.
1/1	Thank you, hopefully when everyone can receive a vaccine we can see our families and friends again!
1/1	Thank you, these informative communications are always useful and welcome. At the same time I think that at the moment the critical part is to find ways to expedite production and administration of the vaccines. There are many willing to get the shot that still need to wait. #iamhere
1/1	Thank you, to these people who are @ the front of the line for us, but please get vaccinated, it is so important. keep safe everyone
1/0	Thank you. And they are trying their best to convince us that a fast track is going to be safe. If true, that means that all the long-term studies that have been done (and required by law) have been for nothing. Either that, or they are feeding us a load of lies, due to the enormous amount of money involved in the ones who can do this first, second and third. Let them take the money incentive away completely, and we will see a complete collapse of experimental vaccines for Covid 19. Human lives are nothing compared to money.
0/0	Thank you. But what about its effect on old people. There are evidence in some countries that it is causing death to them. You should be transparent and clarify more.
1/1	Thank you. I loved the way you presented the facts. üá®üá¶. As a member of the older generation I have no fear of vaccines. As a child I had the usual polio, smallpox, whooping cough and diphtheria. In the last two years I‚Äôve had Twinrix, Dukoral oral vaccine, Shingrix, a Tetanus booster, the pneumonia vaccine and the flu shot. I have also had my first dose of Pfizer.
1/1/0	Thank you. I needed this broken down simply and you achieved that.
1/-1	Thank you. I've been trying to tell my family this, and they refuse to listen. I have medical problems and am fully vaccinated.
0/0	Thank you. It is always nice to see yet another person admitting how few arguments there are for vaccinating against the coronavirus, and how most of those amount to threats to spread minor misery around... ;)
1/1	Thank you. Thank you scientists, lab techs, logistics professionals, truck drivers and all involved in this Herculean effort.
1/1/1/1	Thank you. Unfortunately, most science deniers will just ignore you. Some people fail to appreciate the effort of dedicated health workers, virologist, physicians. Thank You
1/1	Thank you. let‚Äôs prevent as much hospital overflow as possible. Get vaxed !!!!! Think about who your going to displace who need hospitalization for a serious illness that wasn‚Äôt from Covid.
1/-1	Thank you. some of us might already be frustrated because there are already people in our lives that are mean spirited antivaxxers that believe conspiracy theories.

0/0	Thankful for a voice of sound reason in the chaos. As a healthy 57 year old with no co-morbidities I have no plans to take the vaccine anytime soon and certainly not before the plethora of 70+ and 80+ year old friends I have!
1/1	Thankful to have completed my 2nd dose last week with only 1 side effect (sore arm).
1/1	Thankfully we had vaccines by now. Human Civilization would have crumbled with these many cases without the vaccines. This is pretty much equivalent to 100k deaths in a day.
1/1	Thanks "Strong Medicine " Doctor a lot for your simple and informative explanations about Covid vaccine. I am big and loyal viewer of yours videos. Like!!!, Subscribed ü§ó

1/1	Thanks Doctor for the great video. I had been on the fence from all the negativity from family members for exactly the myths which you have answered in the video. Your video has put my back on track to trust in science and data rather than all the gossip and myth that is floating around.
1/1	Thanks Doctor, you convinced me, I will get the shot :)
1/1	Thanks Doctors, Nurses, scientists, researchers and all in the medical field that are telling the facts, even in the face of overwhelming ignorance. Thank you for all you do.
1/1	Thanks Joe! And thanks to all the scientists that made this happen. They do the heavy lifting, and never seem to get the credit they deserve.
1/1	Thanks John. I still hope to get Astra Zenneca as well. You inspire hope. I looked far and wide to avoid the 55 to 65 rule.
1/1	Thanks John. Once again, you are quite welcome on a screen in my home today. => Glad to see the great vaccine news and Penny‚Äôs reports. => One can take this data on a vaccine decrease efficacy and eating the decrease for the other vaccines. Still well worthwhile. Would have been approved with this lower, estimated lower efficacy. => Thanks again John for all you do and who you are.
1/1	Thanks Moderna! I just finished my second vaccine dose; I was expecting side effects so I took the day off. I was fine & ended up completing all my yard work. One Aleve took care of my arm & I had no other side effects.

1/-1	Thanks for all the links/explanations. I have been countering myths and misinformation regarding SARS-CoV-2 on numerous channels. (It can be somewhat exhausting at times.) Your video will be of great use in that regard.
0/0	Thanks for being a guinea pig. I have some other products needing testing... interested?
1/-1	Thanks for clearing this up for me in a way that makes sense man. I've been on the fence for a while mainly due to distrust of the government but so many people have gotten it. Definitely considering pulling the trigger on it
1/1	Thanks for covering this story, Chris & Angelo! Perhaps it might inspire some of the misinformed and stubborn to vaccinate and save lives... not just theirs, but the ones they might infect.
1/1/1/1/1/1	Thanks for everyone who commit themselves to make the covid-19 vaccine!
1/-1	Thanks for explaining while also acknowledging that the concerns are understandable. I've been trying to research this, but every article has such a condescending tone. The world is so rife with misinformation and conspiracy theories, it's difficult to know who to trust. Your explanations are easy to understand for me, and I'm someone who has a hard time interpreting the scientific data. I appreciate the info.
0/0	Thanks for getting the shot. We need to reduce the population.
1/1	Thanks for getting vaccinated. Hope everyone does when they get the chance. I‚Äôm a little nervous but I will definitely do it.
1/1	Thanks for not being a selfish human and putting others at risk !
1/1	Thanks for posting this video. I get my second dose at the end of this month, so at least I know (kind of) what to expect. If I have the chills and nausea and all that, it sounds like the flu. so nothing I haven't been through before. I didn't have any reaction to the first dose besides my arm being slightly sore. I felt better after watching this and knowing that we're all going through this. Getting the shot is way better than getting covid.
1/1	Thanks for posting this! How exciting. If I were healthy I‚Äôd‚Äôve volunteered. But I‚Äôm fat, old, and partially blind so I‚Äôm sure they wouldn‚Äôt have wanted me.

1/1	Thanks for saving all those lives.
1/1	Thanks for sharing and giving a good example. My 2 sons in the frontline also got theirs. Those who are scared of the vaccine I ask - How many died from COVID19 ? 350,000 +. How many from the vaccine ? Zero. It's a no brainer.

1/1	Thanks for the article. I agree. I have had the COVID, but will take the vaccine when it is available. We should be grateful that we live in a country such as this, where we have wealth and great companies. My wife is from Colombia and it will be a long time before they get the vaccine.

0/0	Thanks for the military numbers. As a member of the Army I won‚Äôt get it until it‚Äôs an order. Then I can make my medical claims in 10 years. You can‚Äôt make claims against something you ‚Äúvolunteered‚Äù for.
1/1	Thanks for the post! Especially grateful for the note about how we aren‚Äôt bragging with our post-vax selfies but being #vaccinesafetyadvocates! I got my 1st dose today (student social worker here) and so far no side effects bar a slightly sore arm. Hope you‚Äôre feeling much better!!

1/1/1/1	Thanks for the video. It has helped convince my wife to get the vaccine.

0/0	Thanks, this only confirms that C-19 vaccines can be dangerous
0/0	Thanks. but knowing what big pharma is capable of. I think I'll just use battery acid instead!
1/-1	Thanksüôè
1/1	Thankyou Doctor.... Really true ..i have also taken vaccination on the same day you have... My experience is same all good ...Ashwani Unicef..
1/1/1	Thankyou for helping yourself and the rest of the world. Much love
1/1	That 'YES!' had the proper amount of spunk! I wish more people in the media weren't afraid of using the proper tone needed to convey the importance of vaccines.
0/0	That 1/2 dose by "error" seems very sketchy. I would want to see how they justify it in the paper.
0/0	That BAME vaccine chestnut is pending for the media next to be pushed , no thanks not interested in your poison
1/0	That Guy: Less than 1% of people die from COVID! Same Guy: 6 PEOPLE GOT A BLOOD CLOT FROM THE J&J VACCINE! YOU'VE GOT TO BE INSANE TO TAKE IT!!!
1	That being said, once the vaccine is widely available (or when the Fall 2021 semester arrives, whichever is first), I will happily go get mine too.
1/-1	That being said, please get vaccinated if you are medically eligible for it.
0/0	That could be a paper card ‚Äì or a tiny tattoo on their arm, invisible to the naked eye but readable by an infrared scanner. This technology already exists and has been tried on live animals and human cadaver skin, said researcher Ana Jaklenec at [MIT] Their method uses micro-needle patches that can deliver both the vaccine and a squirt of an invisible ink under the person‚Äôs skin, storing the vaccination record.
1/1	That disease killed millions of people every day, it needs to be stopped
0/0	That doesn't change the toxins in the vaccines.
0/-1	That doesnt sound socialist/communist does it? Either take our sham vaccine for the scam C19 OR you go on a list of dangerous subversives who we will lock out of society.
0	That doesn‚Äôt change the fact that there is no long term Human trials. There isn‚Äôt, it is nonexistent.
0/0	That effin vaccine killed my mother today. She was fine before getting it. Do not take it EVER
1/1	That feeling when your whole staff has finally gotten their first dose of the jolene vaccine in their systems It‚Äôs gonna be a much better weekend now!!!
0/-1	That guy looks and sounds so trustworthy... I'm surprised he didn't say to download his ebook linked in description. This is a ridiculous money making machine and we are getting speeches from sales and marketing guys at companies that benefit from all this chaos. At the same time preventative treatments are a myth and nobody focuses on minimising risk... This is a circus, where people just stomp on hippocratic oath.
0/0	That is a definite no to the vaccine. I will rely on my immune system and the good Lord.
1/-1	That is a person who is not going to believe the data no matter what you tell them. They think pharmaceutical companies have the government in their pocket ... they are not going to believe anything you tell them
1/1	That is all vaccines do- they train your body to recognize and fight the virus so that your body does not get overwhelmed.
1/1	That is awsomeüëåüèºüëåüèºüëåüèºi wish Denmark were more effective. We are sooooo slow hereü§õüèæü§õüèæü§õüèæü§õüèæü§õüèæonly about70.000 have received the vaccine hereüôÑ
1/-1	That is false information. This is a vaccine, not something strange and unheard of. And it is not gene therapy. It is just a vaccine.
1/1	That is great news. More people need to get the vaccine.
1/1	That is great news. This man is a world treasure.
0/0	That is illegal an insane , you cannot force people to take vaccines , our body , our choice , this is like forced Rape , Massive Lawsuits against this government.
1/1	That is really good news wow there is some negative comments bout the vaccine but I think it‚Äôs a great break through and I will defo have it I‚Äôm a care assistant for elderly people with dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs and diabetic so I think it makes sense
1/1	That is so good to hear JR. My parents got their first shots this past weekend.
0/0	That is the definition of stupidity. We gave you a vaccine that we know nothing about, in fact take two doses and we will wait and see how it works out. Ahhh stupidity has no bounds
1/1	That is the finding of all Vaccines, there is always the potential of a side effect, but there is also risk in a car accident on your way to work, and generally that risk is much higher.
0/0	That is the numbers they will admit-it is definitely MUCH higher, and many of those died within a couple of hours of vaccination AND STILL NONE LINK THE DEATH TO THE VACCINE. This guy is nothing but a vaccine shill-his advice will surely get people killed. Any doctor etc promoting this toxic crap should be banned from practice. Its murder, plain and simple.
0/0	That is the problem. Any death induced by vaccine will be shown as unrelated death on papers. U dont take a chance with life like this. It is not russian roulette. Authorities should be careful and approve vaccines only after proper trials and not under political pressure
0/0	That is until they fine you for refusing or decide not to serve you. I can't afford that :( It's masks today, vaccines tomorrow. We are royally fucked.
1/1	That is very sad,but remember thousands of people all around the world have died of the disease.The vaccine gives most everyone a fighting chance.
0/0	That is who committed the murder, their poison
1/1	That is with ANY medication! Someone is bound to be allergic to or have a reaction to ANYTHING!! Food, medication, perfume etc! The majority are fine!
1/1	That isn't true, maybe the vaccine was rushed but that they would give an another disease to it's people is just dumb, we're in a middle of a pandemic. Causing an another one won't be beneficial.
1/-1	That lady saying she got into researching vaccines because her kid was immunodeficient. Aren‚Äôt we telling people to vaccinate their kids because we want to protect those immunodeficient people and people who might have allergies to chemicals in the vaccines?
1/1	That makes me very happy. I was getting depressed thinking the vaccine may not work on the new variants. Science comes through again!!! Please let this be over
1/1	That means, Coronavirus will end soon!
1/1	That might be a good idea! Why have they waited this long?
1/1	That moment when science and technology saved us all !
0/0	That much side effect? Not taking it!
1/1	That newfound mRNA way to create a vaccine, salute for the scientis
0/0	That one didn't work? Try this one! That one didn't work? Try this one!
0/0	That reminds me, I need to book my measles vaccine booster next week. Oh wait, no I don't, because the measles vaccine doesn't need a booster, because it's a vaccine.
0/-1	That seems to be encouraging news. This is the Oxford vaccine?
0/-1	That shot made my baby‚Äôs race change! We‚Äôre both white! These vaccines are crazy.
0	That snake on your logo is killing humanity, spreading poison in the name of vaccination. Nkt.
0/0	That vaccine is not safe my dear people do not let them inject you .it is an experimental vacine that will destroy ur lives....pls take heed our God is the biggest protection.
0/-1	That vaccine is the mark of the beast believe it or not.
0/0	That vaccine protects no one!
0/0	That vaccine we know is a mark of the beast,we better die of corona than going to hell
0/0	That vaccines can take at least temporarily the worse effects of covid but most people don't get really bad effects from covid and a booster and maybe even more will be required.. I'm now very sure that the vaccine is causing much more serious injuries then is said and is no good
0/1	That was one amazing B12 shot
0/0	That was the point of the vaccine, get rid of the old people.
0/-1	That would be a lot better for People's health than this vaccine ever would. But you see they're not interested in your health.
1/-1	That would be absolutely fine, fantastic deal. Nearly 100% survival rate and doesn't make the majority of people bedridden like other flus. As a matter of fact, you need a test forced upon you to see if you have it. Give me the papers, I'll be the first to sign.
0/0	That would be an atrocity, don‚Äôt make people take it! No to vaxx
1/-1	That would be like euthanizing them
1/1	That's a smart announcement - it incentivizes citizens to go get vaccinated, and gives the tourism industry some sort of a timeline for restart so they're not completely left in the dark, like in many other countries.
1/1	That's a strange way of saying we met our 70% vaccination rate. Great work everyone; time to open the country back up.
0/0	That's all we need is another worthless vaccine that gives people the virus and lets them spread it to other people
1/1	That's awesome! One step closer to having an actual vaccine!!
1/1	That's bad. I hope Health Canada approves both the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines soon.
0/0	That's because it's NOT SAFE! How can so many people think it's safe.
0	That's because it's not a vaccine. It's a placebo. Lol
1/1	That's because most people are vaxed, no one said the vaccine stops covid, it saves a lot of people from dying and makes symptoms less
0/0	That's because the injection is NOT a vaccine! The reason it is called a vaccine is so that the pharma cannot be sued for damages when the inevitable deaths and serious side effects manifest themselves.
0/0	That's brilliant that you're fine after #CovidVaccine. I've had seizures, blackouts, loss of balance, skin irritations, worsening eyesight, menstrual disruption, memory loss, coordination problems, excess tiredness ... Now waiting for MRI brain scan and blood tests.
0/0	That's brilliant that you're fine after CovidVaccine. I've had seizures, blackouts, loss of balance, skin irritations, worsening eyesight, menstrual disruption, memory loss, coordination problems, excess tiredness ... Now waiting for MRI brain scan and blood tests.
1/1	That's concerning. I would not want to get medical care from someone who doesn't want the vaccine. Not just from a Covid perspective, but because I wouldn't trust their judgment.
1/1	That's cute, but Amish ppl get covid too, in fact it's hitting them hard right now because they don't want to vax.
0/0	That's easy, they don't work at all. You get the vaccine and still get sick. Take ivermectin and you don't.
1/1	That's exactly why you vaccinated and why we should vaccinate-to REDUCE RISK of transmission, especially for folks with chronic health issues. Point being to stay out of hospitals, off vents. Prayers for continued recovery.
0/-1	That's extremely positive. The only big logistical issue remaining is the need for a second dose.
1/1	That's good. If you're gonna be a moron and not wear a mask, not get vaccinated, and then OD on horse paste... stay home and leave the ICU beds to non covid patients.
1/1/1/1/1/1	That's good. We really dropped the ball in containing the virus but at least we're doing good on vaccinations.
0/0	That's great! Kids can put this in them even though they are virtually unaffected by Covid
1/1	That's great, especially considering the infection rate also provided some immunity as well. So, there are two competing immunity processing going on.
1/1	That's her immune response kicking in, it's a good sign that the vaccine is working well for her. Aching for a few days beats the possibility of getting incubated for Covid by a trillion.
1/1	That's incredible. Most vaccines aren't that effective. I believe that's much more effective than even the measles vaccine. And they sprinted a marathon to get this done in record time.
1/-1	That's interesting to know. But the title of your video is miss leading. Please remember that people in the UK will watch this, the Oxford vaccine is a different type.
0/0	That's interesting, why didn't you bring up that vaccines have to have a way longer testing trail periods and a far grander pool of participants to determine if they are save, than we had even until now? Or that governments gave exemptions to pharmaceutical companies to shield them from liability?
0/0	That's it I am not having the booster, in fact I'm not having the second jab either, because I never had the first. Nay, nay and thrice nay.
1/0	That's just classic "your immune system is responding" side effects. Probably less common in older individuals because of their less active immune systems.
0/0	That's just the tip of the iceberg they are not approved safe yet ...it's experimental tell people the real risk ...
0/0	That's me. I want NOTHING to do with coronavirus vaccine
0/0	That's nice. Still not getting one. The one time I got the flu shot is the one time I got the flu. I'm not chancing Covid
0/-1	That's not good
0/0	That's ok, you can give mine to some other sheep. At least until the military knocks on my door to force inject me. But I know, that's "crazy talk" right.
1	That's part of the reason why vaccines exist, to get herd-immunity.
1/1/1	That's really good efficacy for the first generation of usable vaccine. That chart says it all. Guess I am going to take it
0/0	That's still a hard pass.
0/0	That's straight up bullshit. Getting a vaccine that isn't FDA approved and having no idea what the long term side effects can be is way scarier than a sickness that has a 99% survival rate. I'll stick with my own immune system and sit back and watch the guinna pigs for a couple of years...
1/1	That's the normal side effects of the vaccine. Believe me, some days of feeling sick id way better than having to en entubed in a ventilator, and possibly die.
1/-1	That's the reaction I get from the mundane flu shot. I think it's more of a physical reaction to getting your arm jabbed through the muscle with a sharp piece of metal, than any biological or chemical reaction to the needle's contents.
1/1	That's their choice. Get the vaccine and protect yourself. Whoever chooses not to can live with the risk.
1/-1	That's true, but then the patient is also responsible for the consequences: dying, getting much more sick, losing your job, etc. Mandatory vaccinations is not a new thing
0/1	That's why it was mild...because of the vaccines!! Try without them!!üôÑüôÑ
0/0	That's why vaxxers always say "I was VAcciNAteD and iM FiNe" and all of us who have actually looked into the vacines laugh and laugh
1/-1/1	That's why you make it mandatory.
0/-1	Thats a whole lotta trust issues
0/0/0/0/0	Thats alright ill take my chances of catching covid
1/1	Thats brilliant . lets pray nobody suffers with any of the side effects Times are though and to stay positive is a great challenge but lets all try . Lots of ppl are syill loosing their lives so the only hope is the vaccine
1/1	Thats great news! I cant wait to get mine.
0/0	Thats one way they can reduce the population to half a billion.
1/1	Thats the other joke. Its all on the little white leaflet no-one reads. Its hardly a conspiracy! Medicines have side effects because they have effects. The only "medicine" with no side effects is homeopathy. Tap water doesn't cause allergies. Unfortunately it offers no protection against viruses either.
0/0	That‚Äôll be the Nano technology in your system changing your DNA bruv. good luck to you
0/0	That‚Äôs I don‚Äôt take vaccines or my kids they lie too much
0/0	That‚Äôs a definite NO from me!
1/1	That‚Äôs a scientific miracle!!!BRAVOO!
1/1	That‚Äôs amazing I am glad all the frontline people are getting the vaccine. Thank you for helping us.
0/0	That‚Äôs awesome!! Did y‚Äôall figure out what side affects it will cause years down the road! :D oh ya of course you didn‚Äôt....ya just start stabbing everyone with this crap!
0/0	That‚Äôs exactly my reasoning. I believe in vaccines but I‚Äôm not willing to take a new and experimental one
0/-1	That‚Äôs exactly my reasoning. I believe in vaccines but I‚Äôm not willing to take a new and experimental one. Thankfully I probably won‚Äôt have to either since I live in Taiwan and things are fine here
0/0	That‚Äôs exactly what I was thinking like I just want to wait to for more testing until I take it
1/-1	That‚Äôs fine as long as you don‚Äôt infect others if you get the virus were you vaccinated as a child or have you ever taken illegal drugs what do they contain
1/1	That‚Äôs fine, let them indulge themselves in their own stupidity. More vaccines for the rest of us
1/1	That‚Äôs fine, my family will be safe and all the dumbasses will get sick or die
0/0	That‚Äôs funny, these people, they don‚Äôt know if and how this treatment works. Lets mind wash the kids to help us spread the narrative. How CCP is that???
0/0	That‚Äôs gonna be a no for me dawg
1/1	That‚Äôs good news. We may see the end of this pandemic soon. #GetVaccinated
0/0	That‚Äôs good you can give my vaccine to someone else because I am not having it
1/1	That‚Äôs great news, but before we administer this fully-researched, life saving medicine to our children, shouldn‚Äôt we first consult with our Facebook friend‚Äôs brother-in-law‚Äôs second cousin‚Äôs former little league coach?
1/1	That‚Äôs obvious bullshit. mRNA vaccines are safe and effective and unless you are enjoying the pandemic, you should get vaccinated as soon as you are eligible.
1/0	That‚Äôs one of my concerns. If this vaccine won‚Äôt give you long term immunity, what good will it be and how close are they to finding this out without exposing the test subject to actual active Covid?
1/1	That‚Äôs relieving to hear. Most of my coworkers and family are either antivax or narcissists and will not get vaccinated.
1/1	That‚Äôs relieving to hear. Most of my coworkers and family are either antivax or narcissists and will not get vaccinated. At work today, our company was notifying us that we have free flu shot vouchers that we can print and use at any pharmacy. This lady said ‚ÄúThe mRNA contains aborted fetus cells and i am a Christian I unfortunately can‚Äôt be pro life and pro vax at the same time.‚Äù A couple people agreed with her. Where did this aborted fetus cells shit come from?! I simply cannot understand how a person gets to the point where they believe something like that.
1/-1	That‚Äôs so frustrating to hear. Everyone around me is antsy to get the vaccine. It‚Äôs hard that so much supply is held up on 1A
1/1	That‚Äôs what I do. As someone fully vaccinated I plan on returning to normal life. I got the vaccine because my line of work exposes me to a lot of people (air travel). You‚Äôd be concerned and surprised at the number of people however who have no intentions on getting the vaccine and have no intentions on masking or social distancing. Covid just doesn‚Äôt exist in their world
1/1	That‚Äôs what being anti science does to you... it rots your brain!
0/0	That‚Äôs what happens when you try to force people to get a vaccine through mandates or monetary incentives. Vaccines that work sell themselves you jackasses.
1/1	That‚Äôs what is happening here, giving vaccines to people who really need it
0/0	That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt won‚Äôt it l had covid and survived without the vaccine
1/1	That‚Äôs why I fully support businesses requiring vaccines for both employees and customers. It‚Äôs fine if you don‚Äôt want to get vaccinated ‚Äî but don‚Äôt expect to participate fully in society.
0/0	That‚Äôs why I won‚Äôt trust that vaccine. If they want to withhold initial side effects information, what are they not telling about that rapidly developed vaccine
1/-1	The "EBOLA" vaccine is for only one strain and clinical studies have yet to be conducted.
1/1	The "natural immunity is better" argument is complete BS.
1/1	The "older" technologies have allowed vaccines against covid with 100% rate at stopping any serious illness from the virus. That is all that is needed.
0/0	The "vaccinated" are still getting sick (therefore it is NOT a vaccine...)
1/0	The "vaccine" doesnt make you immune. Just ask colin powell.
0/0	The "vaccine" has absolutely NOTHING to do with the imaginary virus. It is all about the Khazar New World Order tyranny. It is one stage of the mark of the beast.
0/0	The "vaccine" is a hodgepodge of nasty shit pumped directly into your tissues to bring down your immune system so that the next thing that comes around will kill you.
0/0	The "vaccine" is not permanent. Not only that, the "vaccine" doesn't even work (because it's not a vaccine). It doesn't give you immunity from the virus, and it doesn't stop you from being contagious.
0/0	The "vaccine" isn't one. Do some research before you choose. Why are loads of front line workers refusing to get it.
0/0	The "vaccine" may well sterilize these same women you say you support. Personally I want to see your financials. And I dont want my tax dollars to go towards your supposed goals. Nothing the government touches truly helps the impoverished.
0/-1	The "vaccines" and the subsequent booster jabs, lower the natural immune system with each jab. This makes the person more susceptible to infection. Eventually they will die either from the infection, Antibody Dependent Enhancement, Myocarditis, Blood clots, brain hemoraging, cancer or some other related cause. Sounds like fun doesnt it jabbers?
0/0	The "vaccines" are NOT "vaccines" but rather gene therapy, which has never been used before. They brand new technology and have not undergone Phase 3 clinical trials and is not approved by the FDA. It is impossible to say they are "safe and effective." Already, severe side effects and deaths reported to the VAERS (vaccine adverse events reporting system are well over 15,000, and it is estimated only 1% of adverse events are even reported.
1/1	The #COVIDVaccine helps to lower your chance of getting severe #COVID illness. The #booster helps to strengthen your immune system after the first vaccine series.
0/0	The 'experts' have been bought off. This is NOT a vaccine, it is a barely untested dna altering operating system. The 'news' has a lot to answer for.
0/0	The 'vaccine' doesn't work. #fact
0/-1	The 0,0000008% of a chance to get a reactions is the same percentage we have to contract Covid hence why they will not get me onboard.
1/1	The 1st vaccine is better than none until the best is found.
0/0	The 40-year-old man in AstraZeneca's developed acute neuro encephalopathy. Before that incident, a trial volunteer developed symptoms of transverse myelitis. It's a rare debilitating neurological disorder linked to vaccines. In September, a trial paused after another participant in the U.K. got the same symptoms. In October, a participant in Brazil died. What's more shocking is that MHRA expects people to suffer from COVID-19 vaccines.
0/-1	The American Association of Physicians and Surgeons have been against this whole Covid scare from the very beginning amd have been against all restrictions and especially no need for a dangerous untested vaccine!This is sinister!
0/0	The American Government has no business whatsoever telling the citizens of America what to do with our bodies.
0/0	The AstraZeneca shot killed my relative; he died from multiple blood clots.
0/0	The AstraZeneca vaccine could give me a blood clot
0/0	The AstraZeneca vaccine has been linked to an extremely rare blood-clotting condition called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS)
1/1	The AstraZeneca vaccine is based on very well known, proven and trusted vaccine that just has been adapted to SARS-CoV-2. Don‚Äôt believe in what the media tells. The vaccine works properly fine.
1	The AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine is actually a viral vector vaccine. It is a DNA virus, but it is pretty different from an actual DNA vaccine.
1/1	The AstraZenica and Johnson-Johnson vaccines are known to have very rare side effects. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccins do not have known side effects.
0/0	The Astrazeneca jab killed my twin brother , everyone has to make their own decision whether to take it or not I certainly won't now but had planned to.
1/1/1	The Australian TGA said before tacking the vaccine shot, you have to have a vegemite sandwich and a glass of Australia wine, you can place your order on their website,
1/1	The CDC announces that if you are unvaccinated for COVID-19 that you are 97% more likely to die from COVID-19 than people who are vaccinated for COVID-19. So, what good, valid, intelligent, and/or, well-researched reason do you have to not get vaccinated for COVID-19?
0/0	The CDC in the US has confirmed that natural immmunity after having Covid is nearly 5 times as effective as vaccination. A study by John Hopkins uni shows it protects for nearly 2 years
1/1	The CDC says people with allergies to certain foods, insects, latex and other common allergens can get a COVID-19 vaccine.
0/0	The CDC should be renamed the CPC (centers for population control)
0/0	The CDC, as of March 8, 2021, reports 1,637 deaths from the Covid-19 vaccine, and Dr. Cambell is not concerned about this? WOW!!! I have no words.
0/0	The CEO of Pfizer doesn‚Äôt even want to take the vaccine. He even sold about 60% of his own stock lol
0/0	The CEO of Phizer said he doesn't want the vaccine because he "doesn't want to cut the line" That should be all you need.
0/0	The CEO of the pharmaceutical company that received a hundred-million-dollar boost is going to say yeah 90% effective for sure And hey everybody knows they can't be sued
0/0	The CEO's who made the vaccine won't even take it, that is why we should not take the shot
0/0	The CNN host Brianna said she can‚Äôt wait to vaccinate her already naturally immune 3 year old. I feel sorry for her child, having to be part of this experiment. My kids got Covid and their symptoms were sneezing for one day. Maybe her child has severe health issues? Then I would understand.
1/1	The COVID 19 mRNA vaccines - do not impair fertility - do not cause miscarriages - do not accumulate in the ovaries If you believe any of this they you are a conspiracy theorist. These truths have been fact checked by numerous sources.
1/1	The COVID 19 mRNA vaccines do improve pregnancy outcomes, meaning if you get COVID 19 and are pregnant you are less likely to die or lose the pregnancy if you are vaccinated.
0/0	The COVID VACCINE will Kill you. Fight for the CURE.....
1/1	The COVID risks are waaaaaay worse than getting the vaccine, come on people it is that simple
0/0	The COVID vaccine is like a tattoo‚Ä¶. That you can never remove ha ha h
0/0	The COVID vaccine specifically, I simply don't trust it. I am anti-politics because it's such a circus so I am neither far left nor far right.
0/0	The COVID vaccines I would never take or give to my family
0/0	The COVID vaccines don‚Äôt prevent infection; they lessen symptoms just like taking vitamin C, vitamin D and Zinc.
1/1	The COVID vaccines that are available fit the profile of vaccines that are generally safe during pregnancy
0/0	The COVID vaccines were failed day 1 because 1) Mortal antigenic sin's (original antigen sin) sub-optimal prejudiced initial prime & 2) no immunological stimulation of the mucosal barrier/lining
0/0	The COVID-19 Jab Is Not A Vaccine, It's A Pathogen Creator by Dr. Dave Martin
0/0	The COVID-19 Vaccination contains a severe problem along with it. See, COVID-19 Vaccination contains the Mark of the Beast. Why folks go on and on about whether or not taking the Vaccine will do good... the answer is: only if you desire life in Hell.
0/0	The COVID-19 is not an FDA approved vaccine, it's experimental....it's junk, you take it Doctor and you can have my shot too.
0/0	The COVID-19 pandemic can be eradicated without vaccination.
1/-1	The COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread suffering. In order to alleviate these harms, it is critical that a solution be found to the pandemic as quickly as possible.
1/1	The COVID-19 vaccination will help keep you from getting the virus.
1/-1	The COVID-19 vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca showed 76% efficacy against symptomatic infection for three months after a single dose, with greater effectiveness when a second is given later, according to a study.
0/0	The COVID-19 vaccine has not gone through the same long-term testing that other vaccines have and it is only certified for emergency use. It is barely a vaccine and there is still a lot we don't know about it. This isn't just a flu shot and it should not be treated like one.
1/1	The COVID-19 vaccine is a miracle!
1/1	The COVID-19 vaccine is recommended for people who are actively being treated for cancer
1/1	The COVID-19 vaccine is recommended for pregnant women, a group in which the risk of severe COVID-19 is substantial,
1/1	The COVID-19 vaccine, when it exists, will be one of the ones that both I and my doctor consider absolutely necessary.
1/1	The COVID-19 vaccines are 95% effective in preventing severe disease and death ‚Äì that is even more effective than the annual flu vaccine.
1/1	The COVID-19 vaccines are not only safe, they're life-saving. Trust the experts, trust your community, and trust the one million people who have already had it. When your time comes, take the vaccine. @SGadiLondon
1/1	The COVID-19 vaccines should be mandated for all schools.

1/1	The Covid Vaccine has undergone rigorous tests that are globally recognised as having the highest safety standard.
0	The Covid vaccine is neither safe nor effective, anyone trusting the CDC and/or the FDA is an ignoramus. People need to trust their physicians
1/1	The Covid vaccines are usually safe for most
0/1	The Covid was intentionally put out to depopulate us. Next they are going to hire thugs to cause riots, and cause a civil war. Open your eyes people. Biden is in bed. With China.

0/0	The Covid-19 Vaccine is going to turn into the new flu vaccine, except your going to be taking both and they still won't work.
1/1	The Covid-19 vaccine are safe. The second shot can make you feel like you have a 24 hour bug but then you're fine.
1/1	The Covid19 vaccine is excellent. In a family of 5 where one of the member got both doses and was exposed to the virus 25 days after getting the 2nd dose. All the family tested positive except for the vaccinated member.
1/1	The DM comments are full of anti vaxxer garbage, such as from users like MozManc.
1/1	The Danish Health Authority said studies had shown a higher than expected frequency of blood clots following doses, affecting about one in 40,000 people
1/-1	The Dr. Are taking it, so if you don't want to take it's find, but stop scarring everybody.
0/-1	The EU have dug a great big hole for themselves. Their incompetence is astounding, so no wonder this federal organisation is hated. Read the article in Spiegel International about VDL and the EU's incompetence and get yourself educated.
1/1	The Earth is not flat. Covid is not a hoax. Vaccine works. Pass it on.
0/0	The Entire history of vaccines show that MOST problems and dangers come 2 years later..
1/-1	The FDA gave the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine emergency authorization to use in children ages 5-15 years old and full approval to use in people ages 16 years and older.
0/0	The FDA has to keep money going to the Pharmaceutical Companies even if it is through unnecessary vaccinations.
0/0	The FDA released a statement yesterday saying the vaccines ‚Äúremain effective without boosters‚Äù hours after Moderna themselves released their own study that their vaccines are not as effective without boosters. They even cited a larger amount of vaccinated testing positive for covid. So ask again why people have issues with the government and the vaccine.
0/-1	The FDA says common side effects, in Pfizer's clinical trial involving some 44,000 people, included pain where they got the shot, fatigue, headache, chills, fever, and joint and muscle pain.
1	The FDA says its OK so I think it is
1/1	The FDA would have carried out a thorough review of data from clinical trials. The stats speak for themselves. Prevents 100% serious illness. For all those who have misgivings from taking the vaccine just do it. You have nothing to lose. You have everything to lose by not taking it. I know how nasty this illness can be. Struggling to breathe is no fun, in fact, it's absolutely terrifying. #Jabup!
0/0	The FDA's average length of time it studies and tests a vaccine before approval is over 30 years...
1/0	The First Corona Vaccine was invented in Russia, Everyone is optimistic....
1/0	The Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) has announced it has approved a herbal medicine - Cryptolepis sanguinolenta - locally known as Nibima for clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19, after a "detailed assessment".
1/1	The French have discredited a perfectly good vaccine....You reap what you sew.
1/-1	The Gamaleya vaccine is based on the same tech as AstraZeneca. It should expectedly have a similar efficacy and side effects as the latter.
0/0	The Government can take my vaccines. I'll be generous and donate it to them.
0/0	The Government has no right to tell me what to do with my body. If the Government was so concerned with the health of the people, it would work to reform the entire food industry.
0/-1	The Great Reset or do they mean the great culling don't forget your vaccine folks. OPEN YOUR EYES PEOPLE. (These pricks will kill you.) If we cannot see the big picture by now (agenda21) what hope have we got? Good luck everyone.
0	The Guardian doing its part to push the Vaccine agenda.
1/-1/1	The J&J vaccine is a one-dose jab compared to the AstraZeneca which requires two doses, so why not roll out the J&J if its quality and risks are no different to the AZ vaccine?
1/1	The J&J vaccine is the one I got , it‚Äôs been a week and nothing happened.
0/0	The Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine must not be used until all issues are corrected If just a few get suck or die it must not be used unless a person is tested for reactions There are other vaccines now Use them!! We know they are safe !
0/-1	The Johnson and Johnson shot should be pulled from the market. There are more cases than this and you should report the truth!!!
0/-1	The Kennedys' are against vaccines, the elite are avoiding it, so should you.
0/0	The Large drug companies are already asking for indemnity against prosecution against future unintended side effects of any C19 vaccine , very confidence inspiring that is !
1/1	The Leader in Canada announced that Pfizer's vaccine is coming and it will be Free to all Canadians. Love my country.
0/0	The MRNA covid19 vaccine contains Nanobots (see Neuralink & bitchute. com). There are concerns of sterilisation. Bill gates plan is depopulation. Please be AWAKE
1/1	The MRNA vaccines especially are proving to be one of the most important breakthroughs of the century. I'm really excited to see how they go.
0/0	The Measles Vaccine killed my whole family and offspring
0/-1	The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency(MHRA) regulates medicines in the U.K. MHRA excepts that the will be many COVID-19 vaccine side effects. The organization posted a bid for an A.I system to track the expected flood of COVID-19 vaccine injuries. MHRA said that: The MHRA urgently seeks an Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) software tool to process the expected high volume of COVID-19 vaccine Adverse Drug Reaction (ADRs) and ensure that no details from the ADRs' reaction text are missed
0/0	The Moderna and Pfizer Vaccines are Bill Gates/Dr Fauci scams. In Florida hundreds of old people are dying after getting their jab. I refuse to take it. I will wait for the data just like the 70% of the Hospital personnel are doing.
0/0	The Moderna vaccine has ruined my life. My period is not ending, and I am anemic. My period has been non stop for two weeks now and its been making me very sick. I got my first shot on the 2nd of this month, and ever since then I have had a heavy period. It is not stopping. I am miserable and I am terrified its going to end up killing me.
1/1	The NHS has approved it. Health Canada has approved it. My brother and his girlfriend are both scientists (they don‚Äôt study in vaccines specifically but there both super smart and do their research) and there both gonna get the vaccine. That‚Äôs good enough for me.
1/1	The National Drug Authority as part of their achievements has closed more than 600 unlicensed health facilities and impounded medicines from unqualified personnel and poorly kept places following the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic.
0/-1	The Netherlands suspends the use of Oxford-AstraZeneca as a precaution
1/1	The New Zealand data showed that the most commonly reported reasons to get vaccinated were to protect family and self, with safety being the chief concern about the vaccine.
0/0	The ONLY person who will decide what goes into my body is ME!
1/1	The Omicron variant was a stark warning of the consequences of global vaccine inequality. I've joined 300+ scientists to tell the government to clear away patents and let low and middle-income countries manufacture Covid-19 vaccines. #PeoplesVaccine
1/1	The Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine already had its 3rd trial which supports its positive results elsewhere in the World..why hasn't the FDA given emergency approval for this vaccine as they have Pfizer & Moderna????
1/1	The Oxford vaccine accidently discovered that a half dose followed by a full dose gave 90% immunity. I wonder whether two half doses could do the same or even create higher immunity still. If this were the case it would release more of the vaccine for global use and reduce the reaction caused from the vaccination Qantas has announced it will only carry those who are vaccinated - good news
1/1	The Oxford vaccine was built off of MERS and SARS research, if you've got even a bit of a pre-existing template to work with then it's not going to take years.
0/0	The People dont need vaccine. Its a microchip in The vaccine. We are not dogs. And We are not WHO slaves.
1/1	The Pfeizer vaccine works - its relatively simple. Just need the new variants RNA to produce and can be quickly turned around
1	The Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines are extremely safe, with some mild expected side effects, says the UK's drugs regulator
1/1	The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines are very safe, but I'm wondering what country you are in where you can be young enough that your parents can force you to be vaccinated, but old enough that the vaccine has both been authorized and is available in your age group.
1/1	The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have been given to around 30,000 people with no reported problems. The vaccine technology they use has been used in cats for more than ten years. No treatment is ever 100% safe but it seems conclusive that taking the vaccine is safer than not taking the vaccine.
1	The Pfizer vaccine bus hit about 20 hours after my second shot. The fatigue is no joke. Don‚Äôt make plans after your shot. But I am so grateful my body is building immunity. #vaccine @pfizer
0/0	The Pfizer vaccine is killing of the elderly, as expected, but WHAT will it do to the young?? when their turn comes. Are we in the UK hearing the truth.???
0/1	The Pfizer/Bio was a pleasant surprise today. They were much quieter about it, but it's promising
0/-1	The Pharmaceutical companies are so happy.
0/0	The Polio vaccine works. So does the measles, smallpox, shingles, tetanus, mumps and rubella. The COVID vaccines don't work!
0/1	The Queen is old, Boris Johnson is old, they should have got the vaccine first.
0/0/0/0	The REAL headline: Moderna President details plans to ramp up ways to make as much money on MSM Frightened Americans as possible......... WAR breaks out in Big Pharma land!
0/0	The Sheeple on this site rushing to get the vax, shock me with their unquestioning faith. I feel sorry for you and your future, if you have one.
1/1	The Shot Won't Kill You...Caronavirus Will.
1/1	The Sputnik V vaccine, developed in Russia, has been shown to be 91.6% effective against the coronavirus, according to a new peer-reviewed analysis in the medical journal The Lancet.
0/0	The States who's people have received these COVID shots. Strangely have the the most current COVID cases .
1/1	The T- and B-cell immunity is all that matters. Same of vaccine-induced adaptive immunity. This is what prevents severe illness.
1/1	The U.K. has already vaccinated more people than the 27 members of the EU combined. Thank god we voted for Brexit.
0/-1	The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says the most common side effects of the Moderna and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are:injection site pain and swelling, fatigue, headache, chills and fever
1/1	The UK government have decided to increase the time adminstered between the 1st and 2nd doses, instead relying on a slightly less efficacy rate of the 1st dose, but to cover a much wider population. This plan in different to many other countries but studies suggest this approach should pay off. The 1st graph only takes into account countries who have admininstered BOTH does, and therefore doesnt quite give the wider picture to reflect the UK's approach. The UK adminstered 600,000 doeses on a single day over the weekend.
1/1	The UK vaccination program is probably the only thing the government had done well during this pandemic. If the numbers continue the way that they are going, the 15 million people in the top four most vulnerable groups will be vaccinated a week before schedule.
0/-1	The US Rollout hasnt been smooth. Me a Canadian: You guys are getting vaccines?
1/1	The US has administered almost 2 million vaccines. Only 8 had serious side effects. 4 required hospitalizations. Everyone has recovered.
1/1/1/1	The US has like a surplus of vaccines and are even giving people incentives to get vaccinated, meanwhile in my country people are are trying their hardest to get vaccinated cause of scarcity. What a world we live in.
1/1	The US should move to immediately approve this vaccine. The EU and UK have, these aren't 3rd world countries. They don't know anything the US doesn't.
1/1	The USA should be proud of how well their vaccinations are going. In my 2nd country Germany, the estimated date when all adults are eligible for vaccinations is in September! In US it‚Äôs the 19th of April! Just great management by our great government.
1/1	The Unicef is obtaining the corona vaccines for the safety of every child by taking pains wherever available the covaxin. It's a big effort but not easy. With this vaccines herd immunity gained by society and it wo√∫ld be as of previous . If parents and children felt Happy the whole society would be safety. Thanks to UNICEF
0/0	The V is pure poison!!! This guy must work for the pharmaceutical companies!!!
0/0	The VAXED Are dropping like FLIES! LMAO
1/1	The Vaccine Isn‚Äôt Mean, It Will Keep Your Cells Clean!
0/0	The Vaccine ain‚Äôt a vaccine. It‚Äôs an experimental biological agent that is killing people....but more importantly will kill many more as a result of ‚ÄòAntibody Dependent Enhancement‚Äô....you‚Äôll die later!
0/0	The Vaccine doesn't work, the virus is a cold to flu range so its bad for elderly and vulnerable, we've been lied to, the bigger picture is damming to our freedom and rights.
1/1	The Vaccine is 100% effective from keeping you outside the hospital and dying,that reason alone is enough to take the vaccine.
0/0	The Vaccine is to control u and kill u so they can have power
0/0	The Vaccine is used as an emergency treatment so no guidelines just shoot and pray it‚Äôs not fda approved so a lot more people are going to die from the non protective false hope vaccine
0/0	The Vaccine will Really Mess you Up!
0/0	The Vaccines are the real virus!
0	The Vaxxed are the super spreaders, they won't tell us that!
0/0	The WHO hasn't approved it!
0/0	The White House just said they don‚Äôt have the vaccine mandate while forcing it on the rest of America. Btw it normally takes 10 years to get full fda approval
1/0	The ability to spew lies for views has created the antivax movement.
1/1	The actual dataset shows a 1:2.5M chance of blood clotting from the AstraZeneca vaccine. There is a similar risk from the J&J vaccine. A 1:1M chance from the Pfizer vaccine is also present. To put this blood clotting risk into context, the MMR vaccine that is given standard to children across the world comes with a 1:100,000 risk of blood clot. It's considered an insignificant risk at that number but AstraZeneca is being chucked out? To put that further into context, it means in a country with 65M people as France has you'd see just 26 people develop blood clots, most of which would not be fatal. Now compare that to the 98,750 CoVID-19 deaths France has experienced... But see what the EU have done is thrown out the British Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and replace it with the functionally identical J&J vaccine that has the same chance of blood clotting. Because this totally isn't political...right?
1/1	The adenoviruses are weakened so they cannot replicate in humans and cannot cause disease
0/0	The amount of Money spent on the fake tests and unnecessary vaccines would be more useful if used to give children all around the world food,
1/1	The amount of anti-vax and anti-quarantine sentiment I see getting lots of likes in YouTube comments on other videos concerns me. People don't understand that the reason media hypes it up is because the younger population often go symptomless when they carry covid-19 and then they think people are overreacting. The reality is that the wreckless symptomless carriers can directly or indirectly spread the virus to vulnerable populations that show symptoms (i.e. the elderly) and that is the problem. On top of this, anti-vaxxers claim the vaccine is a death sentence despite deaths caused after vaccination being extremely low*. The vaccine is safe and particularly in younger individuals, there are side effects that appear after the second dose such as headache, fever, and muscle aches**.
1/1	The amount of people commenting negativity about the vaccine killing them are the same people who eat chips, cake and drink coke for breakfast, binge drink alcohol and other drugs I‚Äôm sure.
1/1	The amount of people commenting negativity about the vaccine killing them are the same people who eat chips, cake and drink coke for breakfast, binge drink alcohol and other drugs I‚Äôm sure. What I‚Äôm trying to say in so many words is if you‚Äôre going to be a stickler about what‚Äôs going on your body make sure you‚Äôre being fair about the things that‚Äôll end up killing you 20 years from now!
1/-1	The amount of people commenting on this that have no idea what they are talking about is baffling.
1/1	The amount of research that has gone into confirming the safety of the new formulation of the COVID vaccine is enormous, as has the amount of caution shown by the FDA and CDC
0/0	The amount of sane people in this comment section gives me some hope. My family think I'm a conspiracy theorist because I'm a 30 year-old male in perfect health who doesn't want to take an experimental vaccine for a virus that's of almost zero danger to me produced by a company that aren't liable at all for any side effects I suffer. LOL.
1/-1	The amount of work necessary to prove bullshit is significantly larger than to just come up with the bullshit.
1/1	The annual flu vaccine has an efficacy of 40% to 60%. The 70%+ efficacy of the J&J vaccine sounds pretty good.
0/0	The answer from me will always be NO.
0/0	The answer is NATURAL REMEDIES. Which are far superior than anything the pharmaceutical companies can ever come up with. Highly effective and completely safe.
0	The answer is NO. You are finding fake news on internet very fake news.
0/0	The answer is no and anyone who tries to force it on me I will fight them to the death it is that simple
0/0	The answer is no and anyone who tries to force it on me I will fight them to the death it is that simple .
1/1	The answer is yes, because your immune system needs to know how to combat the virus, and vaccines are safer than actually going around getting a potentially deadly disease to strengthen your immune system, not to mention it is very easy for the layman to misinterpret information and see: "Oh, aluminum in vaccines? That's a metal, therefore bad." Instead of actually understanding what these ingredients accomplish and how safe they are
0/0	The answer is ‚ÄúNO‚Äù. I will wait, until there is a sufficient proof that the vaccine is not harmful, because tinkering with one‚Äôs immune system can go horribly wrong.
1/1	The anti vaxx meme has lasted longer than the the anti vaxx kids
1/1	The anti vaxxers are doing it because they're getting social reinforcement from their friend circles. It's almost become some kind of cultural forced teaming.
1/1	The anti-vax crowd, I don't know how to reach them. But, I certainly get the desire to turn to shame and ridicule for this group.
1/-1	The anti-vaxers and anti-masker have their own distorted view. Perhaps we should leave it like that and let natural selection take its course and see who is right.
1/0	The anti-vaxxers are literally the embodiment of, "I'm sorta a scientist myself" meme.
1/1	The anti-vaxxers can have bodily autonomy on the moon where there is no atmosphere to carry their disease to the sovereign state of me
1/1	The anti-vaxxers just scared of needles. It‚Äôs just sad lol
1/1	The antivax will regret not getting it.
1/1	The antivaxxers don't like facts. They ignore the inconvenient truth that the majority of ICU beds are occupied by the unjabbed and still think they are right even though 90% have had at least one vaccine and they are in a minority of just afew percent.
1/1	The arrival of safe, effective COVID-19 vaccines is a major development in the coronavirus pandemic. An effective COVID-19 vaccine will help protect people who come in contact with the virus from becoming sick. As more people are vaccinated, families and communities will be able to gradually return to a more normal routine.
1/1	The article suggests eating in Northern Virginia to avoid mask mandates. Please do not come here. Enjoy some of the world famous cuisine available from one of D.C.'s many food trucks. Love thy neighbors and do not spread contagion.
0/-1	The assumption that a healthy unvaccinated person is a greater risk to others than a sick vaccinated person is beyond ludicrous.
0/0	The bad news is this bullshit vaccine DOESN‚ÄôT work.
1	The bad news: The virus that causes COVID-19 is able to infect the same person multiple times. The good news: You have a better chance at fighting it after each exposure or vaccine dose.
1/1	The basis for every action is trust in science.
1/1	The beauty of having ample vaccines is no need to prioritize one group over another. We can vaccinate all.
0/0	The benefit is you get to be a test subject! Hooray science!
1/1	The benefit of getting the vaccine is high
1/1	The benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the known and potential risks. Get a COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5 years and older as soon as you can.
0/0	The benefits of no vaccine outweighs its side effects. They could have used blood serum vaccines like they used to, and not for the thousands of dollars per dose. The pharmaceutical companies want to play with our mRNA
1/1	The benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks, fact!
0/0	The benefits of these injections outweigh the risks....NOT.
1/0	The benefits out weigh the risks surly that means it's unsafe then.
1/1	The benefits outweigh the risk by so much to get the vaccination.
1/1/1/-1	The benefits outweigh the risks
1/1	The benefits outweigh the risks the man says. The bottom line is that doctor would have been alive today had he waited I on the vaccine.
0/0	The benefits to big pharma outweighs the risk to the vaccinated. Notice they said this without saying who benefits.
0/0	The best cure for all of this is clean living. Only way.
1/1	The best explanations I have heard so far. I am fully vaxed and thankful for it. Thank you for doing this debunking video.
1/1	The best is the COVID vaccine is effective and safe
1/1	The best is the COVID vaccine is effective and safe, while some of the side effects do need more time to be seen. Hope everyone stays safe during this pandemic.
1	The best moments of my life in 2021 were the few seconds when I got vaccinated, because I value my life.
1/1	The best thing is after I‚Äôve had my vaccine, if I become asymptotic and pass it it on to one of those anti-Vaxers who end up dead, I‚Äôll sleep just fine
1/0	The best thing to do is to strengthen our body and immune system
1/1	The best vaccine is the one in your arm. I'd happily have any I'm offered.
1/1	The best vaccine is whatever one you can get your hands on. Each person vaccinated makes it more difficult for the virus to spread which is a necessary component for it's survival.
1/1	The best way to inmunicing you must vaccinating
1/1	The best way to protect yourself against Omicron, Delta, & all variants of coronavirus is to take the free, readily available vaccine. You've gotten vaccines before in your life, & it protected you from measles, mumps, rubella & all other bad things. Save lives. Get vaccinated.")
1/1	The best way to protect yourself from COVID-19 including the variant, is to get vaccinated and boosted.
0/-1	The big bad gov made sure no body will be responsible 4 the side effects of the vaccines, not even the pharmaceutical companies.
0/-1	The big question is what are the side effects
1/1	The big thing about the vaccine is your body remembers how to fight covid, so if you happen to get it your body already knows how to deal with it meaning you get less symptoms and side effects.
0/1/1	The bigger angle is that this is a bad day for confidence in vaccines, and that‚Äôs bad for everyone.
1/1	The biggest benefit is that you are a lot less likely to get infected with COVID-19, and will likely have a much milder case and recover quicker if you do, making you less likely to infect others in turn. Side benefit: hugging your friends and family is AWESOME!
0/-1	The biggest concerns are about potential unknown long-term effects and serious side effects of the vaccine
0/0	The biggest fake virus ever!! üòÇ just to poison people with vaccine lool

0/-1	The biggest scam in human history! Ever! Fucking control freaks! I'm not happy! Unless they can Guarantee 100% complete safety with this bull Sh!t im not having a vacation fuck them..
1/1	The blood clot issue of AstraZeneca is 5 in a million. Covid related deaths are 20,000 in a million. India is reporting 1000+ deaths everyday. Please do not spread such messages and discourage people from taking the jab. It is important for everyone in India to get vaccinated
0/0	The blood clots, strokes, and heart attacks are your body‚Äôs way of telling you the vaccines are working.‚Äù
0/0	The blood of Jesus, the word of and the name of Jesus is the best ever to save life by trusting in him And not the vaccination
1/1	The booster jab helps prevent hospitalisation/death from Omicron.
1/1	The booster really seems to help.
0/0	The boosters are just as ineffective and dangerous as the first three.
0/0	The boosters increases the spike protein production and also reduce the effectiveness of the immune system to fight any viruses!
0/-1	The boosters will force a more lethal mutation. The vaccine is not good enough.
0/0	The bottom line is, these shots are very much still in the experimental stage. There are still many things that are unknown.
1/-1	The bridge is only 99.99% safe, instead let‚Äôs swim across the shark infested waters
0/0	The broad application of experimental mRNA transfections against SARS-CoV-2 is a violation of the Nuremberg Code.
0/0	The business model behind these vaccines is easy: Be afraid. Take our magic potion. By the way, you can't sue us if anything goes wrong.
0/-1	The businesses that jumped the gun and fired their unvaccinated employees should be sued into oblivion!
1/1	The cases of COVID are once again increase quickly.Get Vaccinated yourself & encourages others to do.Wear mask while going anywhere n aware others too.
0/0	The censorship on the facts are so obvious that yt will not even allow scientific information to be posted. Have you heard of CRISPR Cas9 used in the mRNA vaccines? Go view articles on it pre cv and you will see it's a gene editing tool that actually be used to modify your dna.
1/1	The chance of having a bad reaction involving blood clots was less than 1 in a million.... and unvaccinated against COVID.. the chances of eventually catching it are far higher..
1/1	The chance that you get infected if you are vaccinated is very less compared to the not taking the vaccine. So it's a common good.
1/1	The child-survival-rate has drastically increased after the invention of vaccines. Every child that dies from measels is a child that could have lived a long and happy life, if the person that infected them would have been vaccinated.
1/1	The children are also paying for the ignorance and politics of their parents. Get them vaccinated so they can hope to live normal lives again.
1/1	The choice is clear get vaccinated and give yourself some hope of survival or resist vaccination and perish without hope. The call is yours to take. I lost my brother to this pandemic only because he had his vaccination put off for one or the other reason as though he never was in doubt that he did want to be vaccinated it was just inexplicable.
1/1	The choice is pretty obvious. Get the shots or get Covid19 and possibly die‚Äîalone and saying goodbye to your family via zoom. Easy. Get the shots.
1/-1	The clear truth is they could have done this months ago, but people were not worth minimal business risk.
0/0	The clinical trials that were suppose to run for 3 years were cut short at 6 months and they got emergency use authorization. And as she said, the trials now continue in you the reciepient. So if you want to be a lab rat, go for it. I will wait for 2 years.
1/1	The clinics are full of people getting vaccinated, but there are very few people in the hospitals with complications.
1/1	The combination of getting vaccinated and following CDC recommendations to protect yourself and others provides the best protection from COVID-19.
1/1	The combination of getting vaccinated and following CDC‚Äôs recommendations to protect yourself and others will offer the best protection from COVID-19
1/1/1	The comments here are a dumpster fire (2020 style) of anti-vaxxers. Science people, can we listen to science for a moment?
1/-1	The comments here are broken and indecipherable. Yet these people get through day-to-day life somehow?
1/1	The comments on this thread is unbelievable.Get yr jabs, we all had it including my teens & we r all well. Most hospitalised r unvaccinated that's a fact
1/-1	The comments on this video make me lose faith in the future of this country.
0/0/0/0/0	The companies don't have to care about adverse reactions or deaths because they have no liability.
0/0	The companies have blown up the clinical trials by vaccinating placebo subjects. The side effect reporting system is overwhelmed. The preclinical work was done in weeks. The technology was considered experimental until last year. You tell me how we know the vaccines are safe.
0/-1	The companies have more immunity than the people taking the vaccine.
1/0	The companies that make vaccines mandatory are the companies that I will patronize.
0/0	The company were i work were giving free vaccines and i pass. I just dont trust it but thank you though ive already got covid so ill let my body fight for me over again im a survivor drink plenty of fluids and honestly tea with honey i though it was a lie but thank god i listen and it help try it god bless.
1/1	The concept of these vaccines have been in the work since SARS was around, so the argument that these vaccines were rushed with no planning whatsoever isn‚Äôt accurate.
0/0	The concern is also that the vaccine was rushed
1/0	The corona wirus is notable for it's attribute of constantly mutating. That is why a vaccine against a corona virus will never be effective. By the time you get the vaccine, the new variant is already spreading . . . like the delta variant.
0/0	The cover up of all the vaxed soccer players heart attacks is truly astounding.
0/0	The covid 19 vaccines are killing and maming people this is a fact! How about telling people they may expect death or disability after their vaccineü§îüêëüíâ‚ò†
0/-1/0	The covid mutation is far more rapid than the vaccination.
0/0	The covid pandemic is invented by the left! The vaccines don't work!
1/1	The covid sohtis no different from a flu shot
0/0	The covid test still needs to be proven. The vaccinated who get covid must be questioning the shot by now. After 5-6 months you're technically unvaccinated.
1/-1	The covid vaccine does not cause infertility, there are two origins of this myth. One is viral Facebook posts spread by anti-crusaders. The other is that a flu-vaccine manufactured to prevent pregnancy is a plot point from the entirely fictional TV show utopia.
0/0	The covid vaccine has me worried. Another Government mistake. It hasn't been tested thoroughly so it won't be going in my arm
1/1	The covid vaccine hasn‚Äôt killed a single person. NOT taking the vaccine has killed more americans than the second world war.
0/0	The covid vaccine is a mendeloid scam!
1/1	The covid vaccine is also about keeping others safe
0/0/0	The covid vaccine is like the flu vaccine. it doesn't stop you from getting it, it just possibly makes the symptoms worse. Also doctors don't know everything, I've had multiple issues doctors couldn't fix but NAET did.
0/0	The covid vaccine is not a vaccine but an insidious method of genetic manipulation. If "gene therapy" sounds scary to you, it should.
0/0	The covid vaccine is not healthy it‚Äôs mRNA splits and rewrites your dna
0/0	The covid vaccine is the ultimate IQ test. If your stupid enough to take the vaccine, your removed from the gene pool. If your brain and instincts are working and refuse the injected poison, you live to fight another day. It's that simple folks.
1/1	The covid vaccine will save us, it's for our safety and to ensure others are safe too. If you don't want to be vaccined because it may kill you think of others that might be affected by your disease. But there is one disease that is highly contagious and I believe you have it miss it's called stupidity
0/0	The covid vaccines are "Authorized for Emergency Use" by the FDA. "Authorized for Emergency Use" is not the same thing as "Approved"
0/0/0/0/0	The covid vaccines are "Authorized for Emergency Use" by the FDA. "Authorized for Emergency Use" is not the same thing as "Approved". Dr. Crotty uses the word "approved." The vaccine roll-out is an on-going study not yet "approved" by FDA.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	The covid vaccines are simply no good- time to BE HONEST with the people.
0/0	The covid ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù is experimental gene therapy that is risky for elderly & those w autoimmune conditions or compromised immune systems. Animals in testing are dying months after at high rates. This info is being censored. Btw the vaccine does not make you ‚Äúimmune‚Äù, either.
1/1	The covid-19 vaccines that have been approved have undergone the same thorough safety checks as other vaccines. Large groups of people have received the vaccine and the effects and side effects have been studied.
0/0	The covid19 vaccine has been the most successful eugenics program in history
0/0	The covidists spend their lives making reductio ad hitlerum against the anti-Pass (remember Darmanin and his Nazi clapping), but immediately get on their high horse when an anti-Pass throws their 4 truths in their face!
1/1	The craziest part is most hospitals are saving the treatments for the unvaccinated.
0/0	The cull as started mass killings in care homes now! Wake up sleepwalkers before it‚Äôs your Grandma/Grandad who‚Äôs next! Can you not see what‚Äôs happening! Covid is not the killer! Vaccines are the killer!
0/0	The curly hair woman can have mine,, this is just killing us for the money maker. If that's not dangerous why those company been waived off the liability,, we all know this will kill many people but will be said they died with underlying health conditions.. u can have mine
0/0	The current 'vaccines' offer no immunity to anything and do nothing to prevent you from catching or spreading Trump's Chinese Flu.
1	The dangers are a bit of a press beat up! You are much safer getting it than not!
0/0	The data shows that covid isn‚Äôt really a big deal‚Ä¶ and far too little of an issue to force a vaccine on someone.

0/0	The death jab
1/1	The death rate is far higher for the un-vaccinated
1/1	The death rate is far higher for the un-vaccinated. Get your shots!
1/1	The death rates became lower in England and America after the vaccine. We should do the same.
1/1	The definition of insanity is refusing a FREE vaccine which can protect you for no good reason
0/0	The definition of insanity, doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.
0/0	The definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. And yet many of the sheep will continue to line up each time they roll out yet another booster. Oh man, people have gone so insane over this.
1/1	The deniers are responsible for many deaths. I will get the vaccine as soon as possible
1/1	The development of this vaccine has been going since the first SARS outbreak. What went quickly now was just shaping it to fit this current virus and then getting it licensed in that form. They're neither new nor less safety-tested vaccines than others. The occasional flu-like symptoms after any vaccination are just the immune system jumping on it and getting to work. That's uncomfortable, but not dangerous. The best argument for it though: What else is there? We have no other option. If we want our lives back, vaccines are the only way to go. Vaccinate everyone, as fast as possible. There is no other way out of this mess. I want to meet friends without first getting my brain swabbed with a toilet brush (some of the tests don't feel good, I'll take the vaccination side effects for a few days over the constant testing). I want to stop worrying about killing my co-workers by accident. I want to sit down with someone and have a pizza, you know, the small joys in life. Or go groceries shopping without feeling like I really shouldn't. It's been a year, please, everyone who can get a vaccine already, no matter which, please get it. I'm way at the end of the list (too young, not ill enough, already had the plague once) I can only go out with a good conscience when everyone is safe.
0/0	The devil is not gona pass he use his puppets to kills us with this vaccine.let the world leaders of all countries take it 1st
0/0	The devil is working behind the scenes..don't trust these you call WHO or scientists..Trust God who will heal all you diseases
1/1	The difference is being vaccinated and masking during peaks is doing the best you can to keep yourself, your family, and your community safe. It isn't 100%, but 60-94% protected is better than 0% protected and walking boldly straight into the grave like this bad dad did. The risks are extremely higher being infected with the real virus than showing your immune system warning shots with vaccinations. The risks you're worried about are not real. You are listening to lies mostly from people with no medical education at all. I am telling you this based on the medical knowledge I have from my lifetime career in health care, not politically motivated propaganda being spread around since 2019. But, if you believed medical professionals, you'd already know all this, so I'm surely wasting my time tapping it out for you right now.
1/1	The disease is very severe. I'm experiencing it now. Anything that can make it easier is blessed.
0/0	The disturbing part is that they're only now doing any studies trying to figure out if these vaccines can cause issues with someone's fertility.
0/0	The doctor said there‚Äôs no reason for me to get a vaccination before my antibody numbers become almost nonexistent
1/1	The doctors and nurses and the team should all get a medal well done
0/0	The doctors that push this need to be held liable. They know, or should know, there isn't enough research.
0/0	The doctors will all tell you that their pharma drugs are safe. I was never told about the side effects before I received a hydrocortisone injection. You know what followed? Extreme muscular weakness, I became too weak to even ride a bike. Non-stop pain in my bones for months. Pain in my brain. Pressure in my chest and feeling like I was going to have a heart attack. You know what the doctors said? They all told me it was my imagination because "the drug takes 12 hours to leave your body." BS.
1/1	The doctors, nurses, and first responders, should get the vaccine first! Followed by older Americans.
0/0	The dozens of ppl I know who had covid and are not vaccinated are doing great. Full blood work shows after two years still have very strong immunity!
1/-1	The dude did the impossible...He survived until 18 without vaccinated .
0/0	The duration of the effect of the vaccine is unknown. People who get it early might be in risk again after a year or so, and if the rest of the world doesn't have the vaccine by then, then the virus will still be around and able to infect the people who got the vaccine early.
0/0	The easiest way to find out how to combat the pathogen is how the human body did it naturally. That way there will be no side effects. Unlike the current vaccine that has shown side effects. Side effects from just pain in the arm to blood clots forming that leads to a stroke.
0/0	The effectiveness of the vaccine is uncertain
0/0	The effects of over vaccination are ENORMOUS. It doesn't just effect the Covid virus by mutation, it also effects other organs in the body including the immune system. This is why those vaccinated are not just showing up in hospitals with Covid, but other organ failures as well. The immune system is designed to protect those organs and when you start compromising it, it becomes confused and destroys specific antibodies it need to protect the body. The conspiracy theories are coming true. The unvaxxed and those with natural immunity are in a much better boat than those vaxxed. Sorry. We warned you
0/0	The elderly and weaken immune systems are always told to get flu shots. These are also the ones attacked most by Covid. Could there be a link? They were pushing flu shots before the Covid broke out.
1/1	The end is in sight, many of my coworkers and I are getting our first doses of the #PfizerBioNTech #CovidVaccine to√¢‚Ç¨
0/1	The entire process went faster than usual for explainable reasons
1/1	The entire process went faster than usual for explainable reasons, but still followed the usual steps for testing and review. There is no risk with the vaccine ‚Ä¶
0/0	The entire vaccination programme should be halted now. People are maimed and dying. They were healthy prior to being vaccinated.
0/0	The entire vaccine machine is built on lies of omission and fraudulent science.. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS quietly paid out by NVICP to vaccine injured people, but the overwhelming majority of vaccine injuries are never even REPORTED. OF the thousands reported, only a tiny few are compensated. therefore, the real numbers of dollars that should have been paid out to vaccine injured people is in the TRILLIONS.
0/-1	The entire world has realized that Covid isn't going anywhere, and the government can't make it.
1/1	The epidemic is subsiding. Let's keep going, get vaccinated!
1/1	The evidence is becoming overwhelming. COVID-19 is linked to a much higher risk of new type 1 diabetes diagnoses in children. Type 1 diabetes is not a trivial disease ‚Äî it is incurable and requires a lifetime of insulin injections. If you need one reason to get the vaccine for your children, this is it.
1/1	The evidence seems so obvious now that these vaccines are working. We can practically put an end to this pandemic if people would just cooperate. I‚Äôm becoming frustrated. We have people begging for the vaccine in non US countries, but we have people over here rejecting it.
0/0	The evil cabal has the opportunity for population control with this vaccines.
0/0	The evil of lying to people for a paycheck day in and day out is really starting to show on this woman‚Äôs face.
0/-1	The experimental three jab is a killer
0/0	The expert opinion I listen to is from Dr Michael Yeadon. He hasn't been bought.
0	The extremely safe vaccine that Belgium said is giving young males heart inflammation? That vaccine?
0/0	The extremism started with the unnecessary lockdowns and unconstitutional mask mandates. It boiled over when governments started forcing people to be injected with mystery juice.
0/-1	The eyes of the two readers move to the right side and left from time to time. This indicate lying.
1/1	The fact is, if it weren‚Äôt for these rich, advanced countries developing effective vaccines so quickly, poor, developing countries would take years to develop their own vaccine.
1/1	The fact that anti vaxxers think it's better for their child to die then to get vaccines is insanity.
0/0	The fact that can use the logic of ‚Äúthis is a extremely rare side effect‚Äù and still force the vaccine but cant use the same logic of its extremely rare for me to die of covid regardless if I‚Äôm vaccinated is really aggravating.
0/0/0/0	The fact that cannot be sued, suggests to me, that the pharmaceutical companies aren't confident in what they are doing.
0/0	The fact that it has aborted babies lung whatever in it....NOPE, not getting it! Got my flu shot but refuse the COVID.
1/1	The fact that people died and other had their life ruined and stained and still theres karen saying chrystals will heal us. Ok karen bring my grandpa and my missed education back with chrystals.
0/0	The fact that pharmaceutical companies & governments will not accept liability speaks volumes.
1/1	The fact that scientists have managed to produce several highly effective vaccines in such a short time period is astounding.We are lucky to have it available soon. I will take it first chance I get. That anyone would hesitate getting it is incomprehensible.
0/0	The fact that the government is hiding alot of shit aka sensoring the truth and only leaving the false information out is crazy. So many people I know have either died or had issues with the vax
0/0	The fact that they have to repeat this message continually makes me feel like they are trying too hard to convince us that it is true
0/0	The fact that they've developed a vaccine within a year is a curse and not a miracle, old boy.
0/0/0/0	The fact that they‚Äôre trying THIS hard to convince people to get that shot should scare the hell out of all of you.
1/1	The fact that we are all waiting on 1 or 2 vaccine manufacturing places to crank out vaccines is ridiculous. They should have had 10 of these spun up and ready to go.
0/0	The fact that we don‚Äôt know what the vaccine will do to our bodies short term, much less long term, and they still want it mandated is outrageous.
1/1	The fact the over 22 MILLION people have been vaccinated in THIS COUNTRY, with one death suggest that your argument is ridiculous
1/1	The fact the ymca has now had a covid case and I‚Äôm still hearing people say they won‚Äôt get the vaccine. Plz just fucking get it I don‚Äôt want covid coz I passed someone in the corridor who‚Äôs been partying because ‚Äúcovid is a hoax and the vaccine has dead baby‚Äôs in‚Äù
0/0	The fact they want to vaccinate every person on the planet proves this has nothing to do with COVID. A virus with a 99.9% recovery rate doesn‚Äôt call for worldwide vaccination on this scale. So what‚Äôs in these vaccines that‚Äôs so important they want everyone to have one?
0/0	The facts are that: 1. The MelesiaAirliness plane shot down over Ukraine was aimed at scientists who were to present a plan for depopulation of the population and parts in Sydney !!! 2.5G + virus vaccine will add height. Torsion, morphogenetic fields can insert, remove ports into or from the aid genome by means of ninformation fields and the pcr polymerase chain reaction. Prof. Luc Montegnier, who discovered HIV portions with the Boleria burgdorferi genome. 3. Bill Clinton said that there are too many people and we should be around 1 billion, Gates says there should be 500 million. Please check the interviews with them. 5. Warming of the external climate - drought and lack of food. 6. Please check why 2.3 million women in Africa are infertile after tetanus vaccination !!!! 7. Please check or exploit from monkeys implanted in the US. This virus wakes up after 40 years causing disease. 8. If flu is a matting virus, why has there been no effective vaccine for it for years? Why don't they vaccinate people who are severely vaccinated
1/1	The facts are the facts, while you may disagree with them, that doesn't change them at all. The vaccines are very good at reducing your chances of being hospitalised or dying of COVID-19. #VaccinesSaveLives
0/0	The failed vaccine that is a weapon of totalitarianism and a tool of control and pharma profit won't end any pandemic. Neither is it intended to do so.
0/0	The fake "vaccine" does exactly what it was designed to do. Virtually all sane people know that COVID-19 is a hoax perpetrated by the Jew World Order.
0	The false security of vaccines is the cause of the fourth wave we are now experiencing.
0/0	The famous baseball player Hank Aaron died 2 weeks after taking the vaccine. He had No medical issues.
1/-1	The fast way to double the effective vaccine supply is to not give it to republicans and let them walk their talk.
1	The faster we get 75% of this country vaccinated, the faster we end COVID and the sooner everything returns to normal
0/0	The fastest created vaccine in history? Hmm smth stinks like the ones who created the virus are also curing it
0/0	The fatality rate of the vaccine looks to overtake covid, in healthy people nonetheless.
0/0	The fda website says they don‚Äôt know if the vaccine will be effective much past three months nor whether it prevents transmission... but yet everyone is convinced this will make the world a safer place. we are now living in the age of the great Nazi cult. I am quickly losing respect for people.
0/0	The federal Government thinks their going to make me get this vaccine. They will be pumped full of lead!!!
1/1	The federal government is providing the COVID-19 vaccine free of charge to all people living in the United States, regardless of their immigration or health insurance status.
0/0	The feeling a lot of us have that the vaccines are dangerous is a guardian angel. Trust your intuition.
0/-1	The few workers naive enough to take the vaccine are not the majority in Sweden, which has basically achieved herd immunity by rejecting economic lockdowns and facemasks.
1/-1	The first challenge is going to be getting 40% of the population to take it after the first 60% who wants vaccines is done being vaccinated.
0/0	The first flu vaccination was 70 years ago. We still have flu today and keep vaccinating. Eventually we will become GMO people with short life.
1/1	The first people who show get the Vaccine (if they want it) not forced, should be the elderly and people at high risk with underlying issues.
1/1	The first second and third shots keep the people who took them alive and out of the hospital... Hospitals are now the "unvaccinated ward"
1/1	The first time in my long vaccine life that I had a negative side effect. General body and joint pain, tiredness, dull headache, loss of smell, and heavy duty arm soreness with itching. All for two days. Liveable and definitely worth it.
0/0	The flu is more dangerous to me, and I don't take the flu shot either. Also because there is next to no risk.
0/0	The flu shot made me sick last time I got one. No vaccines for me.
1/1/-1	The flue shot is only 50% effective.. Least 90% is progress.. I think its positive.. Also after the last year they are better at treating it now
0/-1	The following side effects have also been reported: muscle, and joint pain, delayed swelling, redness or a rash at the injection site
0/0	The fools are the ones taking the vaccine. We don't have any idea what's in it, but if Fauci and WHO recommend it as a way to stop the virus, then for sure, anyone taking the shot is a complete idiot. I'll take my chances. Build up your immune system and you wont get the bug. Simple.
0/0	The frail and elderly were not included in these vaccine trials. IMO, giving it to them now is MURDER!
1/1	The freaks don‚Äôt care how many boosts you want to take. The freaks are upset because they don‚Äôt want to be forced to take them. If you‚Äôre concerned for yourself or your loved ones, then you all should get boosted.
1/-1	The full summary of "I use covid 19 to destroy covid 19"
0/-1	The fully vaccinated "may need to boost again. That's entirely conceivable." Fauci, ABC News 1/23/22
1/1	The fun thing about science is, belief is not required.
0/0	The funniest thing is they would say ‚Äúwe have no idea how long natural immunity lasts, so get this vaccine when we don‚Äôt know how long the immunity lasts‚Äù
1/1	The funny thing is, if the vaccine had a death rate of 11 in 400,000, (2.75/100k) the antivax side would be frothing at the mouth over it.
1/1	The future is now thanks to science!
0	The globalists thought we would all just kneel over and die in the face of the Great Reset. They saw so many lining up like cattle with their double masks on to be injected with some foreign goo. It was all going according to plan, until it wasn't. HONK HONK
1/1	The globe functions as one whether we agree or not. Neglecting to extend vaccinations to developing countries will not rid the world from this horrendous pandemic...Traveling sums it up. Therefore, get to work.
1/1	The goal of the vaccine is to prevent death and hospitalizations because of Covid.
1/-1	The goal of the vaccines is to prevent you from the death (effectiveness) while minimising you to go to hospital (efficacy
1/1	The goal of vaccination is to make everyone immune to the virus. Vaccination is the final solution and the end of the nightmare of the Covid-19 pandemic
0/0	The good Jesus gave me an immune system.. don‚Äôt need your poison.. keep it
1/1	The good news is that nationwide", ' new confirmed hospital admissions in November are down 45% year over year from 2020. I attribute this in part to vaccines'
1/1	The good news is that those fully vaccinated with the booster are doing very well at this point. For example in the last 120 days in Alberta there have been only 5 deaths among the people 3 doses for those under 60, 105 among the unvaccinated. It's more of a problem for those over 60 but even there it's less among the people with 3 doses, 85 deaths among the vaccinated and boosted compared to 351 among the vaccinated.
0/0	The good old brainwashing machine is at it again calling the truth lies. Need to question who‚Äôs profiting from the vaccine? The very people pushing it. Human guinea pigs. Please read the ingredients!
1/1	The good thing about this is that most scientists and medical professionals will get the vaccine. These are the people we want around.
0/0	The gov does not care about you.... they only care about money & power.
0/0	The goverment is gonna flick the switch, and everyone will turn in to zombies.
1/-1	The goverment needs to give incentives for people to prioritise vaccination.
1/1	The governaments approved the vaccine, we need to trust the science, I will take the shot!
0/0	The government are forcing their citizens to take a vaccination without their voluntary consent, this is a human rights violation at this time
0/-1	The government does not care about you
0/0	The government has no authority to mandate anything!
0/-1	The government has no business whatsoever telling the citizens what to do with our bodies.
0/0	The government have all of their vaccine eggs in one basket. If vaccines were killing people do you think they will tell you? No!
0/0	The government is really pushing this. It's a hard pass for me.
0/0	The government is running a scam on us. They take the numbers of deaths from cancer, the flu, and other diseases and label them all as covid deaths instead. This way, the death rates seem way up, when in reality, the deaths of this year are the same as last year, and the year before. (Within 15,000 difference). They outlawed known cures such as hydroxizine and fire the doctors who perscribe it. The whole thing's a hoax to initiate the new world order. How we can stop it is by banding together and spreading the word. Stay safe, god bless, do not consent, do not take the vaxx. Also, last i checked these videos had a like to dislike ratio of 1 to 10. They keep resetting the dislikes. Do not be duped into this illusion they expect us to believe.
1/1	The government needs to give an incentive to those who get vaccinated. A monthly stipend perhaps?
0/0	The government should just suspend all these nonsense vaccines lot people are recovering now we have less than 80,000 active cases so far
1/1	The government should televise themselves getting the vaccine. That'd be a low cost way to give public more confidence in its safety.
0/0	The government will scam people. They don't care. The side effects are horrible and fatal. My neighbor who was a 85 year old woman died 15 days after covid vaccine. Its sad but this is the truth. It's all about trillions $$$ selling the vaccine not about our lives.
0/0	The governments are trying to get people to use themselves as guinea pigs for experimental vaccines for the collective good, at the expense of individual risk. It‚Äôs evil tyranny. My recommendation is run from it and don‚Äôt look back
0/0	The greatest lie ever told is that vaccines are gonna stop this pandamic
0/0	The greatest lie ever told is that vaccines are safe and effective
0	The greatest lie ever told is that vaccines are safe and effective.
0/1	The group of doctors in Houston that administered Ivermectin presented much data. And a drastic reduction in deaths. Since Ivermectin has been FDA approved for decades and have little to no side effects, why would it hurt to prescribe as a prophylactic? It won‚Äôt hurt. And may very well help.
1/1	The growing anti-vaccination rhetoric is putting us at risk from deadly diseases that should have been eradicated completely in this day and age. No one should have to suffer from a disease that vaccines could safely prevent. No one.
0/0/0	The guy said mRNA have not been relatively used before, actually mRNA vaccines have never been used before covid
1/0	The half-wit antivaccine trolls posting here must be second-string. They can't even manage to put together a coherent sentence, much less a cogent argument. The nincompoops try to pretend they understand the science, and in doing so make even bigger fools of themselves. Anyone who sees their moronic blather should ask them just what their objectives are. Clearly, they don't give a ripe fig about the health of children and are almost certainly ignorant adolescents themselves.
0/0	The harder they push the more I resist.
0	The harder you work at trying to change people's minds where this vaccine is concerned the more suspicious of it they are going to become. People's feelings should be respected and we should use plants for medicine not chemicals.
1/1	The harm caused by covid-19 far outweighs any risk from a trialed-vaccine imo
0/0	The hatred towards the unvaccinated is only growing. Now I understand how Germans could do cruelty against other minorities..
1/0	The health campaign was fine, the problem is too many people these days get sucked into sheep like behaviour without analysing the true situation.
0/0/0	The health department order is for you not to think too much about your personal self preservation against being injected with there poison for the greater good of EXPERTS
1/1	The healthcare system I work for has already vaccinated over 5,900+ employees, providers and vendors out of a roughly 8,000 person workforce. The remaining ones either don‚Äôt want it or are waiting to see how others fare with the vaccines first or they‚Äôre not permitted to get the vaccine due to them having just recovered from COVID. A few weeks ago we had almost 500 employees out with COVID or quarantining due to exposure and just a day ago that number was down to below 100. Our COVID patients went from over 400 at its worst to 285 as of yesterday and this includes patients who have recovered from COVID but are still too sick to get discharged. So yes, vaccines do really work in my opinion.
0/0	The history they feed us is lies, no vaccine is good for you. They are designed to be harmful.
1/1	The hospital I work for just went a full week with no new COVID cases among staff for the first time since Feb 2020. Very cool to see the vaccine in action
1/1/1/1	The hospital I work for just went a full week with no new COVID cases among staff for the first time since Feb 2020. Very cool to see the vaccine in action.
1/1	The hospital I work for just went a full week with no new COVID cases among staff for the first time since Feb 2020. Very cool to see the vaccine in action. Edit: This is with 75% of employees having received one dose and 65% having received both doses.
0/0	The hospital here is 80% vaccinated hospitalized from covid so‚Ä¶. Does it really work?
0/0	The human body provides complete immunization on it's own.
1/1	The hundreds of thousands of vaccinated folks who already caught Covid: No kidding, man. At least the vaccine kept it from killing us. For that we're grateful.
1/1	The idea of a link between vaccines and autism has been extensively investigated and conclusively shown to be false
0/1	The idea of a vaccine is not to prevent a virus
1/-1	The idea was to vaccinate 60-70% of adults by September, the target which will be reached, but then the vaccination became the competition, which will ultimately affect the poor countries the most. The target of 85% is unrealistic simply because of the anti-vax movement. You don't have that amount of people willing to take the vaccine, not to mention they won't let their children taking the one. It's all about making the argument against the EU, and the EU is affected by this, even though they should ignore this.
1/1	The idiot anti-vaxers are the creatures of the success of vaccines. I am a pre-vaccine boomer. So I remember fearing polio. My encyclopedia had a picture of a person in an iron lung and of a boy in underpants receiving water therapy because of polio, and I remember the coming of the polio vaccine. Anti-vaxers didn't have that experience because they always had polio vaccine. I had mumps, measles, and chickenpox with a risk of shingles because we didn't have vaccines for those. They and their children didn't have those diseases because they always had vaccines. So the experience of a vaccine coming in to end a dread disease is alien to them. So they fear vaccines without the experience of being saved by a vaccine.
1/1	The idiots who dont vacinate will never understand a graphic
1/1	The ignorant once again hurting the vulnerable, those who CAN'T get vaccinated for medical reasons
0/-1	The immune system is much smarter than all the scientists put together.
0/0/0	The immune system was created to handle things like this!
0/0	The immune system works! Vaccines are not safe or effective.
1	The importance of #vaccination can also be seen when looking at other indicators. One third of deaths among 0-19 year olds since March 2020 occurred in this month, a level well above other, better vaccinated age groups.
1/1	The important information missing here is that underlying conditions is a major contributing factor to Covid deaths. The vaccine would have helped.
1/1	The incredible rate of discovery and development is testament to what can be achieved through collaboration. It would be incredible post covid (getting ahead of myself) if the same vigorous approach could be applied to other prevalent diseases especially those affecting third world countries.
1/-1	The inferior AZ vaccine and no supply to be had from overseas should prompt Australia to establish its own manufacture of a mRNA vaccine post haste
1/1	The information in this video is from the CDC and from the data obtained by the large clinical trials based on both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. And yes, these vaccines were shown to cut viral transmission.
0/0	The ingredients in COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous.
1/1	The ingredients in vaccines are safe in the amounts used.
1/1	The initial two doses will prevent hospitalisation and death
1/1	The injection has no proven downsides so not taking it is definitely a lack of mental acuity.
0/0	The internet says that you can still catch and infect someone with Covid even if your vaccinated. Why get vaccinated if your gonna catch it anyways.
0/0	The interventions including mass vaccination fuels mutations. The 99% efficacy of the vax is creative math.
0/0	The investigation was done by the CDC and Pfizer or the pharmaceuticals is like asking the bank robbers to investigate if they committed the robbery
0	The ironic thing is for redditor s to be so anti-rich, the vaccine is literally the gold vein for the massive corporations behind these. They are getting richer than you can ever imagine.
0/0	The irony is that a lot of people are already living healthy normal lives & the Covid vaccines aren't healthy at all.
0/0	The irony is that by taking the ¬´vaccine¬ª you‚Äôre inviting them to do it again
1/1	The issue is the longer we allow covid to circulate among the unvaccinated the higher the chance it will mutate into a variant that the vaccines are no longer effective against.
0/0	The jab doesn't stop transmission or make you immune, so what is a point to take it.
1/1	The jab is safer than a paracetamol
0/0	The jab side effects kills 2 people for every one it saves from CV.
0/0	The jabbed are super spreader's.
0/0	The jabbed are the victims of big pharma..they will only suffer those consequences
0/0	The jabs are still under emergency use and still in their trial phase. How could they ever force untested medication on people?
0/0	The jabs are the cause of hospitalization and deaths !
0/0	The jabs definitely does Things just doesn't prevent infection or transmission. THATS HORRIFYIN
1/0	The jabs definitely does Things just doesn't prevent infection or transmission. THATS HORRIFYING
1/1	The key is full and early vaccination though and being outside
0/0	The kill shot
1/1	The known and potential benefits of a COVID-19 vaccine must outweigh the known and potential risks of the vaccine for use under what is known as an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
1/1	The lab rats are doing fine. The human subjects are doing fine. The tests are over and the results are in. It's safe it works and we squandered a good vaccine and a lot of money cause morons couldn't do the bare minimum.
1/1	The lack of empathy by the vax hesitant for the people who have suffered from the virus and the frontline workers who risked their lives to save people is so frustrating.
0/0	The larger point is you don‚Äôt vaccinate people for a virus that kills .002%. Has a 99.997% survival rate. Clearly something else is going on. Clearly the vaccine isn‚Äôt safe.
0/0	The largest medical experiment in the history of mankind. Millions of human lab rats. Truly scary.
0/0	The last myth about Pfizer's product collapses! It does not protect against severe cases! #Pfizer #Israel
0/0	The last time I had a flu vaccine I got really sick. I haven't had one since. Realize the vaccine is for other people so even if it kills you, it protects other people from YOU. I've never had a bad case of the flu until I had a vaccine. I'll wait at least 1 year before taking this one.
0/0	The last time I took a vaccine (against the Mexican Flu back in the day) I got very ill. Who says the same thing won't happen again when I take the vaccine against Covid(not that I don't need it)? As long there is no certainty that the vaccine works, I won't take it...
0/0	The last time I took a vaccine it caused a severe allergic reaction. I could have almost died. I'd rather bet my life on the 'flu' than an untested vaccine put out by large greedy corporations.
0/0	The last time there was a mass vaccination program in the US was the 1976 swine flu outbreak, where the vaccine program had to be stopped after 25% already were vaccinated because it was paralyzing and killing people. Gerald Ford even went on television to take the vaccine and encourage it. Since then, Congress has passed new laws that vaccine companies have no liability to be sued if they produce bad vaccines that kill people. Making the vaccine mandatory is irresponsible considering it‚Äôs already troubled history.
0	The law should change , Force them to take the Vaccine or stay in jail for 5 yrs lol
0/-1	The left has been saying that for years now. Trump rallies, motorcycle rallies, football games‚Ä¶ guess what people are not dropping dead from these like you want. Also you have greater than a 99% chance of surviving Covid without a vaccine..
0/0	The less news I watch, the stronger my immune system gets. :)
1/1	The lesser risk, by far, is to get a COVID vaccine as soon as possible ‚Äì any vaccine. COVID has already killed almost 600,000 Americans, and left millions more with long-lasting injuries. If enough people get vaccinated, the pandemic will end. If people do not get vaccinated, new viral variants will evolve, and the pandemic will continue, year after year, forever. This should not be a difficult decision.
0/0	The lesson is...not to take the vaccine..I got offered it recently and I said no thanks..I'd rather take my chances falling down the stairs
1/1	The level of ignorant, self-important reasons, delusional reasons why people are refusing to take the vaccine is truly appalling. On the other hand, good. Step aside. More vaccine available for the rest of us who look at evidence for decision making. As long those people do not interfere with my ability to get vaccinated hey, go ahead, get sick.
0/0	The lied about the masks, they lied about the lockdowns and they lied about the vaccines. None of it worked!
1/1	The light at the end of the tunnel is growing brighter!!
1/-1	The likelihood is less than 1%, looking at the numbers they posted. I'd be more worried I'd did in a car accident on my way to the grocery store.
0/0	The lines for natural immunity with and without vaccine are essentially the same. Natural immunity alone is super immunity.
0/0	The list gets longer and longer!!! Who do we sue if we have severe side effects or family and friends die???
1/1	The long term effects of contracting COVID are worse‚Ä¶perhaps death. I‚Äôll take my chances with the vaccine. There‚Äôs a reason I never contracted measles‚Ä¶
0/0	The long term is 2 to 3 years. I'll take my vaccine after 3 years
0/0	The long term risks from the shot are greater than covid.
0/-1	The long term side effects have never been done for mRNA vax have they? You mention that it's very rare to see significant side effects for other vaccines but they are not mRNA.
0	The long-term effects of the COVID-19 vaccines are unknown.
0/0	The longer I go without getting the Jab, the more confident I become that it was the correct decision.
0/0	The losers who got screwed with their multiple injections might switch to the term "pro-science" instead of "pro-vax". They've been in a permanent flight of fancy for the last two years. As soon as one of their arguments falls through, they use another.
1/-1	The mRNA COVID vaccines are safe, effective and cannot give you COVID.
0/0	The mRNA Vaccine is NOT a "Vaccine". It's a medical device. It will change your DNA forever!
0/0	The mRNA in the vaccine tells the cells to create a protein that stops the fertility of the virus that will effect your fertility also you wont get kids,
1/1	The mRNA ones are the ones being approved now. Looks like they hold by far the most promise
0/0	The mRNA technology is too new to be safe. Don't take the vaccine!
1/1	The mRNA vaccine technology being used here is decades old. We‚Äôve simply adapted it to a new virus. It has been studied enough, you just haven‚Äôt done the studying. The unknown here is the long term effect of getting Covid-19. Fear the disease, not the vaccine.
1/1	The mRNA vaccines cannot alter your DNA. The ingredients of the vaccine do not enter your cell's nucleus, which is where your DNA is stored. Instead, the vaccine simply offers instructions to your cells. Your cells read the instructions, and then they create antibodies against the spike protein found on the SARS-COV-2 virus. The instructions that were sent in the vaccine simply fall apart and disappear.
1/-1	The mRNA vaccines had 100% antibody response. When AstraZeneca was reporting actual numbers the antibody quantities were less and the T-cell response seemed unremarkable. Was not a good day for their stock. Their primate study was not encouraging (Oxford being where the vaccine comes from, I think even going back to SARS, MERS, whatever a similar attempt was let's call it mixed). I think people are being misled, not nefariously but context is lacking. We'll see what the phase 3 results are. I would be shocked if that vaccine is 90% effective and would wonder for how long it would hold up. Maybe it meets a threshold but I wouldn't compare it to the two mRNA vaccines and just expect the same result.
1/0/1	The madlads at Pfizer-BioNTech really are carrying the whole EU vaccination effort without breaking a sweat.
1/1	The magic of science. I‚Äôm hoping that we have finally turned the corner
0/0	The main concern about the COVID-19 vaccines has been among people with a severe allergic reaction to polyethylene glycol (PEG) or polysorbate
1/1	The main goal of vaccination is not to prevent you from getting infected, it‚Äôs to avoid you from hospitalization. And still as of today, people can‚Äôt comprehend that simple explanation.
1/1	The main issue with the pandemic is the anti-vaxxer
1/-1	The main problem lies in production, but not budget.
0/0/0/0	The main reason for not wanting to take it is suspicion that all the safety data is not available, and that the vaccine was rushed to production.
1/1	The main reason you should get vaccinated is to not get seriously ill.
0/0	The main thing that pisses me off is how they are basically forcing vaccines and say its the only option and never even mention normal health or mitigating other risks
0/0	The mainstream media's fear has no effect on me. I've developed natural immunity
1/1	The major drug makers that have developed effective vaccines have clearly saved lives and deserve due credit
1/1	The majority in higher education side with those who say vaccines are safe and effective and the benefits outweigh the risk. So does the evidence they're basing their claims on. The anti's don't have evidence on their side. They don't even have a cohesive argument they can all agree on. They certainly don't have the support of most peer-reviewed studies in credible journals. Most of them have never been published either so their views haven't been subject to criticism.
1/1	The majority of Canadians support VACCINATED WORKING TRUCKERS
1/1	The majority of mothers regarded vaccinations as an efficient method of children protection against infectious diseases.
0/0	The majority of people don‚Äôt even need the vaccine.
1/1	The majority of those getting covid are the unvaccinated, however you can still get covid if you're vaccinated but you are less likely to end up in hospital or die.
0/-1	The majority will know when they make the vaccine passports mandatory. But then it will be too late. This is all Bible prophecy and cannot be changed. We lose short term - but in the end those with Jesus win. In essence, I know we are fighting a battle we've already lost. Just don't take it no matter what. Even if you have to die. Put all your faith and trust in Jesus. Satan's time is short.
0/0	The makers of the vaccine and the government accept that a small percentage will either be grossly injured by the vaccine or die from it. That is business as usual for them, to lose a few for the "greater" good.
0/0	The mark of the beast
0/0	The mark of the beast. Load up be ready to fight. The supreme court is full of murders and podophiles.
0/0	The mask & vaccine mandates are doing far more harm than good.
0/0	The mask don‚Äôt work. The vaccine don‚Äôt work. Repeat
1/1	The measure protects not only the individual, but the entire population. After all, if you don't fall ill yourself, you can't infect anyone else.
0/0	The media and press have all officially become one huge vaccination commercial.
1/0	The media coverage misinformation, government bureaucracy, and peoples' unrealistic expectations and lack of patience based on the logistical difficulties. Please stop telling the general public they can get a covid vaccine at any local pharmacy; let us handle things when we actually secure said product and stop wasting everyones' time giving people false information about where/when people can get covid vaccinations.
1/1	The media in the United States keeps making headlines like "It's only 66% effective!" When in reality, it's 85% effective against severe coronavirus and 100% effective against death and it's been tested against all the new strains.
0/0	The media is so manipulative trying to make it seem like this is the best thing since sliced bread. i‚Äôm not getting this vaccine!
0/0	The media is swinging on J&J nuts. They"re spinning this so much in J&Js favor.
0/0	The media is the entity spreading falsehoods. Brave people like her stand for truth.
1/1	The methodology of how mRNA works is way better and bio-friendly than any other vaccine, regardless the success rates
0/-1	The mid to long term side-effects of this 'vaccine' are entirely unknown. This isn't an opinion. It's a FACT.
1/1	The mild illness caused by the attenuated vaccine is exactly what makes it so effective. This is the closest thing we had to ‚Äúnatural immunity‚Äù.

1/1	The misinformation and religiously fanatic fear of the vaccines and facts is a huge problem. People are being idiots and selfish and that is putting us all in greater danger. üôÑ These fools only use anectodal evidence which is not evidence at all. You CANNOT come to any conclusion without knowing ALL about ALL risk factors.
0/0	The moment I can sue for covid vaccine complications I'll get it but I've been fine since it started
1/0	The moment anti vaxx say vaccines cause autism that's when I plug my ears and compassion goes out the window
0/-1	The more covid is spread the more it will mutate and the more it mutates the less effective the vaccine becomes.
1/1	The more important reason is that I consider it a duty to my patients, most of whom are elderly. My temperature gets checked every day that I work, but I‚Äôm young, and there is a chance I could be asymptomatic even if affected. The last thing I would want is to unwittingly infect my patient. It‚Äôs my worst nightmare. Even the thought of it mortifies me.I will get vaccinated at my earliest opportunity.
0/0	The more it (vaccination) is supported by public authorities, the more will its dangers and disadvantages be concealed or denied
0/0	The more lockdown and the more we vaccinate, the more advantage is given to the more dangerous strains and the more this virus population's only chance of survival is to become more infectious and dangerous.
1/1	The more people get vaccinated, the fewer deaths and hospitalizations there will be from Covid and the less disruption we'll face in our daily lives.
1/1	The more people get vaccinated, the safer we'll ALL beThe more people get vaccinated, the safer we'll ALL be
0/-1	The more people that take this poison the faster we rid the worlds of the weak dumb ass sheeple
1/1	The more people vaccinated no matter what vaccine the faster we shutdown VARIANTS.
1/1	The more people who receive the coronavirus vaccines, the sooner vulnerable people can feel safe among others.
0/0	The more propaganda I see on the jabs, the more I am digging my heels in. No vax for me and that this rate even when trials finish in 2023 I still won't be having the damn thing. #NoVaccine
1/1	The more that gets vaccinated the better off we will be.
1/1	The more that refuse, the more chance my loved ones have at getting one
0/1	The more the merrier I say! This reads really good, cellular responses and antibody titers, robust results.
1	The more the virus spreads and the more people catch it, the more its new strains will come about. Through vaccination, we must prevent the virus from spreading before we have new vaccine-resistant coronavirus mutations. If this ever happens for the first time, we will be in an endless race to develop, test, produce, distribute and apply the vaccine before other dangerous strains appear. And we will always end up losing this inglorious race.
1/1	The more the viruses reproduce, the more mutation there will be. If people would just suck it up and tough it out, the viruses would die out quickly. Unfortunately, having someone's grandma die is less inconvenient than not going out to eat. If only mortality was tied to IQ!
0/0	The more they pressure me to take it the stronger I will say NO
1/0	The more they push the vaccine the less I want to get it. They can keep that. Someone else can have mine.
0/0	The more they push, the more I think 'what the hell is in this shit?' I'll pass on the clot shot.
0/0	The more you comply the more restrictions and mandates they keep adding
0/0	The more you try to convice me, the less trust I have.
0/-1	The more you try to force something on anyone the more they become suspicious of it. And the more suspicious they get, the more they reject it
1/1	The more you vaccinate the less people can get it and (probably) spread it. And if you are vaccinated and can show it you have much less to worry about.
0/-1	The morning after vaccine my dad was violently sick for nearly an hour with diorreah, all week he has felt weak, tired, looked grey, didn‚Äôt want food, just water, 1 week on he finally got out of bed and had food.
1/1	The mortality rate of the virus is immensely higher than the incidence of severe complications from the vaccine, and stopping the spread of the virus will prevent many more untimely deaths.
0/1	The most common reactions are headaches, arm pain, body aches, chills or fever lasting a few hours to a few days.
0/-1	The most common symptom of COVID is you feel just fine, and you have to be tested to even know you have it, coupled in with 99% survival rate.
0/0	The most disturbing aspect of all of this is that only yesterday, claiming that the Johnson and Johnson vaccine may not be entirely safe was a violation of YouTube‚Äôs ‚Äúcommunity guidelines‚Äù and could have resulted in an immediate removal.
1/1	The most frustrating part for me is that these anti-vaxxers die of covid and their families still don't believe that covid is real. My cousin died of covid and his parents still haven't been vaccinated. They both have covid now. Willful ignorance should be made fun of. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
1/-1	The most important part of this video is it showed what true vaccine freedom looks like. How raw and deadly this vaccine freedom is. This video stayed neutral but showed the reality of this "freedom". Keeping perspective when one is afraid is so crucial. Seeing the truth in its rawest form is crucial.
0/-1	The most important part of this video is near the end where it's stated that a vaccine usually takes 10-25 years to develop.
0	The most obvious news story of the day: #Quebec's decision to delay the rollout of #COVID19vaccine booster shots contributed to our astronomically high death toll (still ongoing) this wave. Who could've predicted this? ALL OF US.
0/0/0/0/0/0	The most rushed vaccine in human history? You're damn right I'm not getting it.
1/1	The most vulnerable Americans will get what the least vulnerable deserve.
1/-1	The mother truckers drove across Canada and showed why they need to be vaccinated. Their industry can transport COVID across North America.
0/0	The mrna product is not a vax. Does not meet the definition. Cannot be forced or coerced to take any experimental products against ones informed consent.
0/0	The mrna vaccines blocks your natural adaptive immunity which explains the skyrocketing cases in fully vaccinated nations
0/-1	The narcotics drug distributors would have done the better job than the states.
1/1	The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one. (Mr. Spock) This is not the Delta variant, it's the Darwin variant. But still the selfish and misinformed want the "freedom" to remain unvaccinated and not wear a mask to protect their fellow Americans. Freedom comes with responsibility.
0/0	The negative impact of this so what called "vaccine" is far way more than the positive ones!
1/1	The new bvaccines are new thats why I think they arer more secure and advanced
0/0	The new world order is upon us
1/1	The newest highlight of my day is seeing people post on social they got the vaccine. Brings a smile to my face, especially when it‚Äôs someone I greatly respect. Awesome for you and your family!
0/-1	The newly discovered COVID-19 vaccine may have side effects.
1/1	The news of the vaccine was a much needed morale boost for the UK, and so far it‚Äôs going to plan.
1/1	The news on children is mixed. On one hand (and fortunately), they are far less likely to get serious illness than adults (though that isn‚Äôt absolute - we do have deaths in children). On the other, vaccine development for children has been very slow and we still don‚Äôt have anything for the youngest age groups. I suspect that will change in the near future. For now, we don‚Äôt have any magic ways to protect them so I would take the same sorts of precautions that you do for yourself - masking in those old enough, avoiding crowds, particularly in indoor spaces and trying to limit contacts with those who are ill. It‚Äôs not perfect but it‚Äôs the best we can do.
0/-1	The news reports are forced to lie about a pandemic!
1/1	The next Nobel Prize in Medicine/Biology belongs to Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman. And to those who think the Covid vaccine was developed too fast: Try 1996 when they started developing the science that led to it. Is 25 years of research and development "too fast"?
1/1	The next big issue will be to convince people to take the vaccine
1/-1	The next moment the world has been waiting for! I am crying tears of #joy!!!!
0/0	The non-stop ads for the vaccine state that you need to take it get it so OTHERS will be safe. How is this true if the "vaccine" doesn't prevent your infection (or reinfection), AND icannot prevent the spread of the vaccine to others if you ARE infected??????
1/1	The notion that natural immunity is better than vaccines has been a dangerous lie for centuries. People need to know the facts instead of listening to the disinformation dozen and their hoax alternative health claims in an attempt to make money out of the ones who believe them
0/0	The now applied Covid vaccines are a quick shot, which, out of panic-like fear of Bergamo-like conditions, has circumvented all (well-founded!) legal hurdles (long-term studies, etc.) and is now to be forcefully brought among the people with enormous propaganda bluster for the benefit of the billion-dollar pharmaceutical industry. Without me!
1/1	The number 1 reason we are living longer is due to life extending medicines. These are manufactured by pharmaceutical companies, such as Pfizer. Good luck if you don't plan on taking anything as you age.
0/1	The number of anti-vaxxers is in direct proportion to people who thought the election was fixed....
1/1	The number of doses is not as relevant as when they are available. The Oxford vaccine may be ready in larger quantities before.

1/1	The odd of dying in a car crash are 1 in 103. Does that mean I don‚Äôt drive? I am more safe in an airplane than a car, yet people avoid planes not cars. I have a better chance of being struck by lightening (1 in 500,000) than I do of dying from any of the COVID #vaccines
0/-1	The omicron wave is hitting a population exhausted by a nearly two-year pandemic and its response, with massive tensions evident daily.

0/0	The only 'need' for an vaccine is to continue to propigate fear & profit by big pharma.
0/0	The only ability of the vaccines is that it helps spread the virus and does not limit it.
1/1	The only bad thing that vaccines have done is reduce certain diseases to mere distant memories, so people have forgotten how important vaccines are and how horrible those diseases were.
1/1	The only bad vaccine news is that no lab is producing them fast enough.
1/1	The only excuse you should have for not being vaccinated, is if you have a broken immune system or if you are allergic to the vaccine itself
0/0	The only folks who should get the booster are those at risk with co-morbidities. Millions of people (myself included) know dozens of people who regret the vaccine due to side effects and will not get boosted.

0/0	The only ones that are blind to vaccine dangers are the woke and financially invested.
0/-1	The only problem I have with the vacs. are that the pharma companies were given immunity from prosecution before the people were given immunity from the virus.
1/0	The only protection I need against Covid is a healthy diet, good workouts every day, the love of my family, a shot of mRNA in my arm to build spike proteins, eight hours of sleep, and a fulfilling career. But go ahead sheep, keep getting your microchip ‚Äúvaccines.‚Äù
0/0/0	The only reason I‚Äôm refusing the vaccine... I trust nothing or no one! Period!
0	The only reason im not getting the vaccine rn is because my grandma arm turned green and red like the whole arm for a week and im honestly scared of needles
1/1	The only reason why it got developed is so fast is because the time that it normally takes was long because of waiting for things to happen like waiting for approval and paperwork to go through, but in this circumstance they didn‚Äôt have to wait for things, because of the importance of the situation. The vaccine process is the same amount of time with any vaccine, just less waiting due to the importance of coronavirus.

1/1	The only way through this, to get out of the state of emergency and to stop wearing these things [masks] is to get everyone vaccinated
1/1	The only way to care of others in this pandemic is to take the vaccine as soon as you get the oppurtunity.
1/1	The only way to end this pandemic is to ensure equitable access to the vaccine for all people in all countries. The US must start sharing surplus COVID-19 vaccines with countries that need these lifesaving doses! We need #VaccineEquity now.
0/0	The only way to have true inner peace is to invite Jesus into your heart. His BLOOD is the one true vaccine and no matter how much chaos is going on around us, we can have peace when we know and trust HIM.
1/1	The only way to stem the surge is through vaccination.
1/1	The only way to stop from catching a virus is eradicating it entirely, with most viruses or diseases like COVID-19 Delta strain is most part impossible so the vaccine strengthens your immune system so you can live with the virus in a safe way.
0/0	The only way you're going to vaccinate me is if you kill me and then inject it into my corpse
0/0/0	The only way? Well, it clearly isn't or we'd all be dead by now. We are not. I conclude that a vaccine is not the only way.
0/0	The origin of aborted tainted vaccines will sicken you! Dont believe these numbers! Everythi ng is getting labeled covid! What happened to the flu and other disesases! Bill Gates funded these companies and the chinese! Why would you even consider getting anything from china they gave you the virus!! Did you see the warning from the nurse who now has bells pasley 3 days after gettiing vaccinated? Why are the censoring all doctors and nurses warning people? It take 4-10 yrs to test vaccines! Don't be a guinea pig! Take natural things to boost your immune system!!! Watch before this gets censored and share!
1/1	The other 10% probably live in PA. I'm grateful I've been vaccinated, but we're still hanging out in 1A/1B land.
0/1	The other vaccines being developed will contain weakened or inactive forms of ‚Äúcommon cold‚Äù viruses, and substances commonly found in many vaccines.
0/1	The outrage at covid was everyone losing it with- we need to protect our elderly because we're killing people with life threatening illnesses in nursing homes. While locking people up & letting family die alone. Now the vaccine is good, it only kills frail patients.
0	The overall vaccination numbers might look good on the surface, but there is a much darker side to this.
0/0	The pandemic and vaccines are fraud!
1/1	The pandemic has shown us how devastating a disease can be without vaccines to control it. As COVID-19 vaccinations gather pace, they are a powerful reminder of what vaccines can do. This World Immunization Week, find out how #VaccinesWork.
0/0	The pandemic is fake people. Stay woke.
1/1	The pandemic is not over yet. If you haven‚Äôt had your vaccines or booster yet, it‚Äôs not too late.
0/0	The pandemic isn‚Äôt going anywhere with the vaccine I caught Covid from vaccinated family members I felt fine just a sore throat and they where in bed for three days with all the symptoms so In my opinion NO THANKS
1/1	The pandemic isn‚Äôt over. Please #GetVaccinated and #MaskUp a bit longer!
0/0	The pandemic was never about health ...but allways about control..
1/1	The pandemic will drag on until we get kids and Republicans vaccinated, folks.
1/1	The pandemic will finally end.
1/-1	The pandemic won‚Äôt be over unless the people in developing countries are also inoculated. Delta was detected in 2020. Now a more contagious variant was detected, one year after delta.
1	The pandemic would go away if everyone would get vaccinated!
1/-1	The pandemic would go away if everyone would shut their TV‚Äôs off and not watch the news.
0/1	The parents who choose to infect their kids with spit, pus, etc, do not realise what a vaccine essentially is! Smh!
1/1	The patient on the respirator, Christopher, says his parents got vaccinated and they still got COVID-19. BUT THEY'RE STILL ALIVE. That's the fricken issue - not only are you far less likely to get Covid, you have much milder symptoms. Now his kid has to grow up without a dad.
1/-1	The patient who was fully vaccinated in Feb had no symptoms but tested positive in a routine swab test. All close contacts & 1500 other workers tested negative. This is the vaccine working.
0/0	The people I know that did test positive for Covid said that the normal flu is much worst in terms of symptoms. Don't take this vaccine!
1/-1	The people against the vaccine were definitely not the best selection or representation (though I appreciated Percy very much). I work in healthcare, and in my facility only 65% of staff accepted the Pfizer. Same with my husband, who works at about 5-6 different hospitals. All I‚Äôm saying is, more healthcare workers declined it than media has made it look like, and I would like to hear from those perspectives.
0/0	The people are like the guinea pigs who are being experimented on using clinical trial and error. A few months ago they stopped AZ on seniors. Then it appears they proceeded with a younger age group which now they discovered to be developing cerebral thrombosis due to their strong immune response. Now in this latest report, they want to try it again on ages 60 and above (how sure are you that all of them will have a weaker immune response? Or is it because they are economically expendable?).
1/1	The people in the comments show how uneducated humans really are, i mean comments like "i'd rather bet covid i don't trust the government!" and "No Vaccine for me id rather watch the simpsons they predicted it!". So fuxking stupid it's unreal
1/1	The people who are opposed to vaccines should drink disinfectant, like Trump told them to.
1/1	The people who complain about this just don‚Äôt wanna get the vaccine and don‚Äôt wanna be called out for it. i will take it for sure.
1/1	The people who don't have the vaccine will be part of the reason we will have another lock down for sure.
0/0	The people who got vaccinated there will be not alive or heaalth anymore
1/1	The people who think that these vaccines contain microchips are the same people who forget their phone passcode and blame the government for changing it.
1/1	The people who want the pandemic to end have done all they can to ensure that it will. Every sane person is vaxxed scheduling their booster by now. We need actual leadership. Mask mandates. Vaccine requirement for air travel. This shit is just as bad as it was under Trump!'
0/0	The perfect situation they wanted us all in begging for this vaccine!
0/0	The person who goes to stick me will draw back a stump ! End of story
0/0	The pharmaceutical companies don‚Äôt care. They‚Äôre liability free to do human experiments. Hellooo Mc.Fly!
0/0	The pharmaceutical industry is liability free. Hmmm!!
1/1	The picture of the protesters is what Covid hell looks like, unvaccinated and unmasked throngs bunched up and screaming at the government which is trying to save their lives. All the rest of us can do is mask up, get vaccinated and stay away from those who are not.
0/0	The pifzer showing severe anaphylaxis and deaths??
1/1	The platform is new but it has been tested in multiple studies on more than 100,000 people at this point. I was in the Moderna study and it had little side effect and have not had COVID despite having some direct exposure to someone who had it. I have heard reluctance on it from some people and am curious about some of the hesitancy around it.
0/0	The point isn‚Äôt to stop transmission, it‚Äôs to inject genetic modification into the system.
1/1	The point of the vaccine is to prevent severe illness and death. Your body builds the antibodies so that when you are exposed to the virus
1/1	The point of the vaccines is to keep people out of the hospitals. To lessen the load on the health care workers.
1/1	The point these doctors are making can't be stressed enough! We will not defeat (or be able to live with it) covid until the world is vaccinated. We need to help other nations.
0/-1	The polio vaccine provides lifelong immunity and is the only means of polio prevention. Can the same be said of the covid vaccine?
1/0	The politicians who claim that the AZ vaccine is unsafe are just politicking. The sad thing is that they are politicking with their people's lives! Shame on them.
1	The pool of vaccinated people is significntly higher than the pool of unvaccinated people, so of course you'll have more vaccinated people in ICU than unvaccinated
0/0	The poor will survive because they did not get the pure poison injected into their healthy veins.
1/1	The possibility of serious complications for anyone who gets the virus ‚Äî along with the public health consequences of the pandemic‚Äôs continuing its course ‚Äî are strong reasons in favor of getting vaccinated,
1/1	The power of vaccines is awesome always.
0/0	The pressure will be kept on countries plagued by corruption, the money generated by the #vaccinbusiness is huge and the kickbacks keep coming, it's just the biggest holdup of all time.
0/-1	The primary reason I hear is, ‚Äòit's too new; it's experimental
1/1	The prime objective is inoculating the population as fast as possible. Every vaccination benefits the population as a whole. Just get on with it. Don't waste time. If you're offered a vaccine it is your duty to take it. Period.
0/-1	The problem for me, is not so much which vaccine, but as I had the #Pizer first dose, will I be forced to have a different brand for the second dose, or go without, because the Pfizer #CovidVaccine is no longer available in UK?
1/1	The problem is suspicion isn‚Äôt scientific proof. There‚Äôs a reason we don‚Äôt have smallpox anymore.
1/1	The problem is the time lost, every day you wait around is hundreds more deaths and more billions lost to lockdowns.
0	The problem is we have millions of illiterate people in India who trust the govt. Gates has already run an HPV trial here 10 years back when hundreds of young girls died. The PM of India himself did not take the AstraZeneca vaccine. He took a local indian company vaccine which was a placebo!!!
1/-1	The problem isn‚Äôt the vaccine mandate; the problem is some anti-vaxx truckers who want to wreck the supply chain and bring about some kind of libertarian revolution in Ottawa.
1/-1	The problem nowadays(maybe always was like that idk) is that everyone is having an opinion but barely anyone did real research.
0/0	The problem with all these boosters is it just causes the virus to mutate. You can keep updating the vaccine, but the virus will only adapt to it.
0/0	The problem with being against straight up toxins n poisons being injected into children??
0/0	The problem with natural immunity is that nobody is making a ton of money from it, vaccine is only a money invention!!!
0/0	The problems the injectiins cause are intentional.
0/0	The proof of it's poison is already known
0/0/0/0	The proof of it's poison is already known .
0/0	The propaganda is incredible. Gotta give it to pharma for pulling this off. Creating lifelong customers.
0/0	The propaganda is so thick now, must be getting worried people will think for themselves about what they put in their own bodies
0/0	The protected need to be protected from the unprotected by forcing the unprotected to use the protection that didn't protect the protected
0/0	The protected need to be protected from the unprotected, by forcing the unprotected to use the protection that didn‚Äôt protect the protected.
1/1	The purpose of being vaccinated is to acquire an artificial immunity. You need immunity because you need to hold off an attack, not to prevent one
0/1	The purpose of being vaccinated is to protect one from being infected. That means those that are vaccinated are safe from those that are not, so those not vaccinated do NOT pose a threat. It's not anyone's right to dictate what a person should or shouldn't put into their body whether it be by way of safety, legislation, extortion, intimidation or humiliation period.
1/1	The purpose of getting a vaccine is not to protect yourself. It's to protect your community. If a vaccine comes out and is safe, I will take it. It's the least I can do to help my country out of this crisis.
1/-1	The purpose of the vaccine is to get cured people‚Ä¶
1/1	The purpose of vaccination is to protect us from different pathogens, either bacterial or viral. Covid vaccine protects us from this contagious virus, which is causing this pandemic, killing millions of people throughout the world. Hence this vaccination is imperative for everyone and it does not have any adverse effect except in persons with cardiac diseases taking blood thinners like Warfarin.
0/0	The question is why the CEO of Pfizer doesnt want to take the vaccine?üòÑ
0/0	The question no one is asking is, why should trust without question a vaccin made by the company that paid the biggest fine for lying about side effect and not finish clinical test? Putting on the market drugs that cause people to go depress, cause inflammation and promote cancer growth in some patient
1	The question should be ‚Äúwhen are you taking the covid vaccine?‚Äù instead of ‚Äúare you taking the covid vaccine?‚Äù
1/1	The quickest thing we need to do if we really want to help the American people, is get this economy turned back on ‚Äî get people back to work, get kids back in school, get ourselves some herd immunity, get the vaccine distributed as quick as we can and get the uptake rate up
1/1	The rapid development of the #COVID19 vaccine is nothing short of a modern medical miracle.
1/1	The reaction America is having is very much like zombie outbreak in movies. Ignorance at first, then panics, then serious infections, then government attention
1/1	The reaction won‚Äôt be death, which is many people‚Äôs reaction to catching covid!!!
1/1	The real good news in this update isn't the efficacy being a few percentage points higher than previously estimated but confirmation that it is working equally well in the elderly.
1/1/1	The real issue here is people don't understand statistics. Take the worst case scenario, it's like a 1 in 6 million chance you die from the covid vaccine. There's also around a 1 in 100 million chance you die per mile driven. This means the covid vaccine has about the same chance of killing you as driving 15 miles.
0/0	The real question here is WHO TF is offering up their kids for these trials? You couldn't pay me enough to risk my infants life on a pharmaceutical trial. That is absolutely insane.
0/-1	The real risk is reactogenicity, so it's going to hurt where they get the shot, and that's going to last a day or two,
1/-1	The real thing is painful. Still have it until the 5th. I did everything right, Type 1 diabetic never went outside. Still got it. It's rough
1/1	The reality is that if you are vaccinated Covid poses less risk to you than the flu if you are not in one of the high risk groups
0/0	The reality is the public has been given no data.
1/1	The really important thing here is that we now have evidence that vaccines can be effective (in this case highly effective) against Covid. This means that we can now look to see good results coming out of other trials, especially those that don‚Äôt require storage at such low temperatures.
1/1	The really important thing here is that we now have evidence that vaccines can be effective (in this case highly effective) against Covid.This means that we can now look to see good results coming out of other trials, especially those that don‚Äôt require storage at such low temperatures.
0/0	The reason a mouse trap is so effective is because the mouse does not realize why the cheese is free.....
1/1	The reason for this moment I think is the incredibly complex nature of the working of immune system. And people don't understand it cause there is no simple way to make people understand their working to reassure them unless they have medical degree. And people always fear what they don't understand. It's easy to get misguided and misinterpreted the story if you don't understand the whole picture. It's not anti-vaxxers fault it's failure of awareness by government, failure of education
0/-1	The reason that Germany might be having difficulty with the rolling out of both the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines might be due to storing it at a cold temperature especially the Pfizer which needs to be stored at -70 degrees Celsius.
1/1	The reason that we keep getting mutations is because people refuse to get vaccinated. If everybody got vaccinated, the virus would stop mutating.
0/0	The reason this is the first mRNA vaccine is because it had proven unsafe in all of their studies since it‚Äôs discovery. I wouldn't risk it.
1/-1	The reason vaccines are being ‚Äúpushed‚Äù has nothing to do with conspiracies, and everything to do with the fact that we are living through a public health crisis like we have not seen in our lifetimes.
0/0/0/0	The reason why I‚Äôm not getting vaccine is because I‚Äôve had family members get it and STILL get covid. Also it is literally a test to put on people. We are just experiment and I would rather not get something that I don‚Äôt know fully works which obviously it doesn‚Äôt.
0/0	The reason why they made covid-19 spread is because they want to try this mnar human trials
0/0	The reasons I was and still am against the vaccine(s) is because the Pharmaceutical companies wanted immunity from prosecution if things went wrong, and the Governments (worldwide) allowed it's distribution and use under emergency powers. From day one that rang major alarm bells.
0/0	The recovery rate is 99.9%, so why do we need a vaccine?
0/0	The report repeatedly states that the vaccines " reduce infections" (o.38/1.05/4.34 etc.). If that was the case we could assume that as the % of the population vaccinated exceeded 75% we would see a reduction in cases. Germany, UK and Israel have all exceeded 75% vaccination rates but are currently experiencing their worst wave yet - something isn't adding up.
0/1	The reporter actually said it perfectly: "This prevailing lack of trust in the government. This isn‚Äôt just a 2021 thing, or a coronavirus vaccine thing. This is a mounting, ever growing, distrust in the government at large.‚Äù
1/1	The research + work to get out this vaccine has been in progress for 17+ years. The goal now, today, is to at least, thru vaccination, minimize the amt. of cases that are bad enough to need hospitalization or lead to death. I am high risk. It'd kill me. Pls. vaccinate.
0/0	The results are scary. Say NO to vaccine
0/0	The risk I will get COVID-19 is too low.
1/0	The risk is as high as bedrock
1/1	The risk of COVID is a bigger concern to me than the risk from the unknown around the vaccine.
1/1	The risk of a bad reaction from the vaccine is low.
1/1	The risk of a live virus vaccine is that you catch covid, which is also the risk you face if you don't get the vaccine. There's no way the vaccine will be approved if the risk is higher for getting the vaccine than it is from contracting it from the community. I don't understand your logic
1/1	The risk of catching COVID through not getting vaccinated is, quite literally, orders of magnitude greater than the risk of developing blood clots from the vaccination. And the public not understanding relative risk and probability sure won‚Äôt help with vaccine hesitancy.
1/0	The risk of death crossing the street is much greater than it is from taking the vaccine. "Abundance of caution" my ass.
0/-1	The risk of death from covid-19 is also very low
0/0	The risk of death from covid-19 is also very low, so no need for the vaccine
1/1	The risk of getting a blood clot is from: 16.5% from COVID 0.18% from smoking 0.05% to 0.12% from birth control pill 0.0004% from AstraZeneca vaccine
1/1	The risk of myocarditis from COVID is 8 times greater than from the vaccines. Get vaccinated.
0/0	The risk of the vaccine outweighs the risk of covid imo. They admit risk. I have had the 2 jabs.I will not have the booster. I do not want to be yet another statistic or victim.
1/1	The risks associated with organ transplants are off the charts whereas the risk associated with the vaccine are minuscule. This is like someone who rides a motorcycle helmet-less every day refusing to fly on a commercial airline because it's too dangerous.
1/0	The risks of adverse effects from catching COVID are much more severe and certain.
0/0	The risks outweigh the benefits in the age group. The disparity is enormous, do not do this to your children.
1/1	The risks ov COVID-19, including death, are far more serious than the rare instances of blood clots occurring after vaccination.
0/0	The room, it's spinning real fast.... cuz of the gayness. Riddle me this flower boys. I'm not vaxd along with many of my peers and none of us have contracted covid, I have family and friends that are current on vax and have had covid multiple times along with negative affects from the shot. One lady i know somehow contracted a 1/100,000,000 blood disease three days after her second booster. Covid will end when we stop listening to the overlords.
0/0	The rush to test an experimental biological agent (mRNA vaccine) on our first responders and military should have you very concerned.
0/0	The rush to test an experimental biological agent (mRNA vaccine) on our first responders and military should have you very very concerned.
1/-1	The rushed vaccination will certainly be scrutinized; but once deemed safe, the 16% neutral will surely break.
0/0	The rushness of releasing these vaccines is what worries me.
1/1	The sad part is, they put their kids and other at risk, but these antivaxxer parents are from generations, who were all vaccinated as babies..
0/0	The safest way is to boost immune system through recognized/,proven natural foods and healthy lifestyles.Altering the natural body system definitely has side effects.
0/0	The safest way to protect from Covid is nutrition and lifestyle, not an experiment gene therapy Frankenstein jab.
0/0	The same Government who sells cigarettes is determining what's best for the health of all? Com' on man!
0/0	The same clowns telling us to get vaccines are the same clowns who told us we would be underwater by now because of climate change.
0/0	The same government people question are willingly taking a shot that government employees are exempted from lol
0/0	The same government that leaves schools open during a pandemic ? Yeah I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll pass
0/0	The same has happened to my partner and daughter, tried this on both of them, and this video is true. And it is sticks on different parts of the body, my family have their ones around the chest area. I am not getting vaccinated. My family is aware of this. Would like to know what the heck is this experiment doing to my loved ones? This is abnormal.
0/0/0	The same heavy metals that are in the vaccines they are now dumping on us by the ton from aircraft.
0/0	The same people bashing on me, or who they call ‚Äúanti-vaxxers‚Äù, are the same people saying ‚Äúmy body my choice.‚Äù Pathetic.
0/0/0/0	The same people bringing us these miracle vaccines have also long been advocating for a drastic reduction of the human population.
0/0	The same people encouraging vaccines are the same people that are trying to make all gmo food
1/1	The same people who don't want to wear a mask won't get a vaccine
1/1	The same people who don‚Äôt fear COVID bc of a ‚Äú98% survival rate‚Äù, now fear a vaccine that has a 0.00009% risk of causing blood clots. Make it make sense
0/0/0	The same people who have recalled on meds.. also are the ones that said it was safe.
1/1	The same way different people react differently to the same medication, different people react differently to the same vaccination. ‚Å£ Don't hesitate to take it at all!
0/0	The same way you blindly trust that all medications are safe; by 'experts‚Äô telling you so. The 'experts‚Äô in this case had much less time than the usual to form an informed opinion, so you can assume that their opinion is not very up to standard. Those are the facts. Make of them what you will. I've been down with Covid-19 already, so I see no need to get artificially vaccinated. Natural is always better. Of course, governments are probably going to want to force everyone to get artificially vaccinated through the introduction of vaccination passports, and these will likely have to be updated annually (with yearly shots) as new variants emerge. Personally, I'll take my chances with ‚Äònatural vaccination'; i.e. acquiring immunity by falling ill. The one time I had it, it felt only slightly more uncomfortable than a head cold and resolved in much less time; and after almost a year of good health, I seem to have become as immune to reinfection as if I had taken the vaccine; maybe more so.
0/0	The saying goes ‚Äú if ain‚Äôt broke don‚Äôt fix ‚Äú never had the flu jab either, nobody‚Äôs injecting me with something I know nothing about
0	The scariest vaccine on earth.
1/1	The science behind mRNA vaccines is not new. It‚Äôs decades old,
1/1/1/1/1	The science behind these new vaccines is so incredibly cool. What a time to be alive!
1/1	The science is absolutely incredible. But, how much in body testing is there? So cool that research has been in progress for so long to help stop the current pandemic. I will get it but I would rather be one of the later ones (I'm not at risk nor am I around anyone who is).
0/1	The science is great and vaccines are probably the greatest thing ever. The problem is instead of a multi year (5-10) clinical trial like normal vaccines go through, this brand new vaccine, using version 1 technology, was rushed through in 9 months. I'll wait. Thanks
1/1	The science of mRNA vaccines has been around for 20 years. They tweaked it for covid 19 but it is not new science. So, if you want things to go back to normal, wear a mask and get vaccinated.
1/-1	The science wasn't rushed. Vaccines derived from RNA technology has been around for decades.
1/1	The scientific basis for anti-Covid measures is solid:Vaccines have been proven to reduce transmission, substantially slash the likelihood of serious illness and decrease the burden on healthcare systems
1/1	The scientific community always impresses me at their hard work, even with the crazy high demand and the short amount of time.
0/0	The scientists have no cure for aids virus and flu virus and yet they came up with this vaccine in 6 months ?And after taking this vaccine if people still have to wear masks and there will still be shutdowns then whats the fkn point ?
1/1	The scientists were studying this new vaccines for 3 years thats why we got the vaccine so fast! Its amazin
1/1	The scientists woked hard in making a medicine to make this Corona virus go away. And I believe in them.
1/1/1/1	The second phase of the COVID-19 vaccination drive to cover the frontline Corona warriors will begin today in Gujarat.
1/1	The second shot was definitely worse but I'd rather deal with minor side-effects than dying on a respirator.
1/1	The self centered are doing GREAT harm to our children. Sadly, many will be saddled with life long problems because these stubbornly ignorants will not get the vaccines.
0/0	The shear fact that they are withholding the numbers of those suffering side effects tells it's own story surely! Why is this being allowed to continue?
0/-1	The sheep can't understand why..
0/-1	The sheep lining up like brainwashed idiots. A vaccine for a virus with over 99.9 % chance of survival. A virus so dangerous you have to get tested to know you have it. A vaccine so safe that soon it will be a requirement in order for you to work, travel, go to school, etc. What a joke.
0/0	The sheep will still take it to please the government and MSM.
1/0	The sheeple will believe any rubbish without any evidence, the bigger the lie the more ppl believe it " Adolf Hitler " https://youtu.be/56tA0YlWkXg
0/0	The short term side effect of the shot? No thanks. The long term side effects, especially for people like me with autoimmune issues? We dont know!
0/0	The shot doesn‚Äôt stop getting or spreading covid so it‚Äôs not about public health.
1/1	The shot itself doesn‚Äôt hurt and much evidence suggests the ‚Äúeffects‚Äù are induced psychologically.
0/0	The shot must don't work if she had it the vaccine why does she need to wear a mask üò∑
0/-1	The shot will not prevent you from getting COVID, my daughter's friend caught covid after receiving both injections, she never had covid before
0/1	The shots are safe. Tell that to all the athletes who were in top physical condition and died on the soccer fields in Europe. Guess they didn't get the placebo like American athletes get.
0/0/0/0	The shots are the rear problem not the solution. Way to many side effects
1/0	The side affects may include being amune to covid 19
1/1	The side affects of vaccines are living longer
1/1	The side effects are being healthy
0	The side effects are not documented
1/-1	The side effects are rare, severe and treatable BUT the wrong treatment could also make it worse! Therefore I don't think it's crazy for a short pause to better inform doctors and patients what to do, as long as the pause does not go very long.
1/1	The side effects are temporary and minor. Ill take it
0/0	The side effects are to large
0/0	The side effects are very big
1/1	The side effects are very serious and common, such as an increased lifespan, protection from incredibly painful or awful diseases.
0/0	The side effects are way worse than COVID if you're healthy so

0/0	The side effects can kill you
0/0	The side effects is are minimal‚Äù Ok... yeah. Uhh... the vaccines have only been in people‚Äôs bodies for a few months... not years. So stop generalizing. Cause we‚Äôre not factoring LONG TERM side effects
0/0	The side effects of the vaccine are the same symptoms you get with covid, a bit strange if you ask me
1/1	The side effects of the vaccine is gonna damage less people than Covid itself
1/1	The side effects of the vaccine were nothing compared to my covid experience
1	The side effects of vaccines are minimal if any.
0/0	The side effects won't be able to be realized for years, and by then billions will have the purposeful sterilization side effects
1/1	The six cases were out of a total of nearly 7 million doses given since March, meaning the CDC and FDA assumed the chances of the blood clot were around 1 in 1 million. This is a joke. The risk is soo small as to be nonexistent. The CDC are idiots.
1/-1	The snobbish lipstick relatively present because income subsequently scold regarding a screeching sort. squeamish, delicious square
0/0/0/0/0/0/0	The so called virus is just being used as a vector for the all important toxic vaccine.

1/1	The sooner everyone is vaccinated, the sooner everyone gets back to drinking and business as usual.
1	The speed at which they've got these vaccines ready is nothing short of incredible
0/-1	The speed of which these vaccines were manufactured is astonishing. HIV have been there for a longer time yet no vaccines for it.

0/0	The spread of Guillan Barre' syndrome will be rampant , with the advent of this vaccine.
1/0	The spread of covid doesn‚Äôt stop because one is vaccinated. So the only life you will save is potentially is your own. So let‚Äôs stop lying about how the vaccine stops the spread and saves lives. On that note I do recommend getting vaccinated, but support the right to make your own choice on the issue.
1/1	The staff which is unvaccinated mistakenly believes they know enough to refuse it.
0/0	The studies were done (scientific ones, I‚Äôm sure, peer reviewed, obviously). The study conclusion: anti-vaxxers kill. I know of thousands of parents who vaccinated but wish they hadn‚Äôt. I know zero parents who didn‚Äôt vaccinate & wish they had. But if science says so, must be true
0/0	The study is a single page with no data tables or definitions. Same people lied about IVM and HCQ.
0/0	The study on it's safety won't be completed until May 2023. But yet it's fully "FDA approved"
1/1	The sudden advance and efficacy/safety of RNA vaccines is going to be a huge boon.
1/-1	The suffering and death that COVID-19 brings makes it imperative that we do everything we can to protect each other. This is all about being responsible, whatever it takes.
0/1	The suppression of the anti-vaccine movement is not in line with how a free society should be operating.
0/0	The survival rate for people infected with Covid is around 99.5%. The efficacy of this new fast-track vaccine is said to be 90%. Err... I'll trust my own natural immune system, thank you very much!
0/0	The system is: create a problem and sell them the solution.
0/0	The talk of covid vaccines still not died down yet? I got bored of this a while ago.
1/1	The technology used for AZ vaccine is not new. The mRNA technology used for Pfizer vaccine has been in development for 5 years and we were just lucky it was at a stage where it was ready when covid came along. Yiu know it's being looked at a potential cancer vaccine I'm sure.
0/0	The television fools you. Vaccines are death.
1/0	The term "vaccine skeptic" is such a wash ugh I also hate the "it is not one size fits all" absolute gold fish brain
0/-1	The terror is comming everywhere !
0/0	The thing I am going to tell you is weird but a cure. it is my 20 years experience over pneumonia üåà A healthy man doesn't need to be vaccinated of any covid 19 vaccine because this immunity doesn't work for long and second thing covid 19 is not harmful for everyone and the vaccine is not a solution because covid 19 mutilated itself with time third thing, can a vaccine treat body inflammation or pneumonia? answer is no! and the other thing is. If covid 19 is so fatal it would have killed every affected patient. And next thing why the death ratio is different through out the world .actually it is patient body's overwhelming action on corona that makes the situation worst and because of this patient's body get inflamed and later he faces septicemia and it is a cause of death. In some cases the patient faces some heart and kidney related problems. and the thing is responsible for this, it is inflammation because inflammation damages patient's respiratory system and it is the reason for whole crisis. Because in lack of oxygen the patient's body system get destroyed and septicemia make the situation dreadful . because of it patient's body lose it's capability to kill the virus. I make you sure that The patient's body has capability to fight against covid 19 no matter what type of virus is that. but it needs time and the patient has to avoid inflammation . and it is the way the patient can avoid inflammation. Believe or not we can resist our body inflammation by controlling our eating habits it is possible. I am a patient of pneumonia myself and I was fed up of allopathic treatment but I followed some aurvedic instructions and some research was done by myself , today I am hundred percent healthy. I don't face pneumonia since last two years. There is no possible vaccine for corona and only Ayurveda can save from this mysterious virus. If someone gets affected with covid 19 he should eat only the following things. if a corona patient eats the following things his body would not produce mucus and he is safe - the things are - wheat, gram(chana) , white sugar, milk ( milk from animals) and all products made from milk , salt, red chili, mutton, chicken, fish, mustered oil, tea, masoor dal(peagion food ) ,green leaves but not Cobbage, remember all this products mustn't be contaminated and they must be pure. if the patient eat these things and don't eat enything else and follows these instructions strictly. Covid 19 can not harm him at any how . it takes 15 to 18 days because the patient would have eaten something already that his body would take 15 days to stop producing mucus. If someone get affected with covid 19 he must consume the said foods because this thing takes 15 to 16 days and if someone delays to apply this thing. The situation would be out of control so apply this thing immediately and the patient must wash his nose with hot water. I mean warm water and inhale hot water thrice a day by his nose and he shouldn't mix the cold water into the hot water to get the temperature down because if he does so. I don't know why but the result will be zero. so to get the temperature down either the patient can pour the water or he should wait for some time. I think Patient nose is a heaven for the virus because neither body's action nor medicine works there the patient must wash his nose. how, it is on himself because virus enter into the lungs from here and the patient get affected again and again. it is my personal experience and please have a trust on it.the patient mustn't eat the fruits neither a single bite and others vegetables besides green leaf because fruits and vegetables are the main source or cause to makes our body producing mucus. It means if the patient follows the said instructions his body never get inflammation and a healthy person doesn't need to follow this formula. It is for those who are under threat and either they have a history of pneumonia or they are in their old ages and patients of diabetes or at high risk. besides them no need to worry it is only common cold for a healthy person nothing more. I am a patient of pneumonia and I have been researching on pneumonia for last 18 years. if the patient trusts this thing. and applying this thing. he never need a vantilater and he never going to face any worst or a death. do you know why the death ratio is less in poor countries. it is the reason. the poor people don't eat fruits and vegetables as much compare to the richer and mostly the rich people have been dying with corona. a six month old child never faces pneumonia because he fed only its mother's milk. a wild animal never face pneumonia because he never eats another feed besides green leaves, a man never faces pneumonia if he eats the said things. and if you get over with it once you needn't to worry at all( if you are not a patient of pneumonia). friends pneumonia made my body too sensitive. so I discovered this thing. it took me 18 to 20 years to sort out these things. I have most sensitive body because if I eat an orange I get a body pain immediately and if I eat rice continously for four and five days I get cold that turns itself into pneumonia after one or two days I have faced corona and it took me 16 days To get rid of it and it was like a some different kind of cold for me i lost my appetite, smell and test. I became weak my nose was running continuesly for four five days but I didn't face any mucus problem I have seen it. It was very dreadful but I saved my life because I am on the said diet already but if I won't have known this thing I would be a dead man yet for sure with this therapy you can cure septicemia or such wounds that not have been getting cured for long time. It takes fifteen to eighteen days to get the results starting. (A healthy person must avoid fruits and vegetables during the infection. and an under threat person must eat the said foods during the infection) Note: vitamin c daily value is different for different people. a patient of pneumonia needs very little amount of vitamin c and green leaves like spinach and lettuce can full fill this need perfectly.
1/1	The thinking of those refusing to be vaccinated, if present 50-100 years ago, would mean we‚Äôd still be battling small pox, typhus, and polio myelitis. They don‚Äôt want to recognize that most of those vaccines also had their version of emergency approval.
1/0	The third dose increases immunity, so after the fourth dose you are protected. Once 90% of the population has received the fifth dose, the restriction can be relaxed as the sixth dose stops the virus from spreading. I am calm and believe that the seventh dose will solve our problems and we have no reason to fear the eight dose. The clinical phase of the ninth dose confirms that the antibodies remain stable after the tenth dose. The eleventh dose guarantees that no new mutations will develop, so there is no longer any reason to criticize the idea of twelfth dose.
1/1	The third shot should do it.
0/0	The thought of knowingly infecting yourself with a disease is so frightening to me,
0/0	The thought of polio coming back auctually scares me
1/1	The thousands of trial volunteers have demonstrated its safety.
0/0	The thrust from gaits and the powerful elite is reason enough to NOT get poked.
0	The time to prevent the damage was in the beginning. Pushing experimental vaccines and immune-system-weakening lockdown policies, if anything, increased the amount of damage inflicted. Whether it was incompetence or malice, this situation cannot be forgotten.
1/1	The tinfoil hat brigade should be made to watch this. (only kidding, you'll not change their dangerous opinions). Still, I'm very impressed by how this explanation is both easy-to-understand, and without hyperbole. Thank you.
1	The tinfoil hat brigade should be made to watch this. (only kidding, you'll not change their dangerous opinions). Still, I'm very impressed by how this explanation is both easy-to-understand, and without hyperbole. Thank you. üëç
1/-1	The tinfoil on the internet. What a joke.
1/0	The top scientists had a lot to prove before actually being taken seriously such as: efficacy and effectiveness of mRNA vaccine and expedient approval process for such vaccine that otherwise could take several several years.
0/0	The toxic synthetic nanobot containing vaccine.
1/1	The tragedy in all this is that a good 30% of the population won‚Äôt want it because they saw some shitty anti-vaccine meme on Facebook. This pandemic has exposed the best of us and the worst of us.
1/1	The tragic thing is, by failing to get the vaccine, the pandemic deniers don‚Äôt just harm themselves: they harm responsible people, too.
0/0	The treatment is worse than the disease üòë
1/1	The treatments have to be proven to work to be meaningful
1/1	The trials are done, what are you talking about? Phase 3 of the testing was done since July until December. There were more than 40,000 participants, half got the vaccine, the other half a placebo. There were no deaths. There was a 95% reduction of transmission in the vaccinated group (169 sick in the placebo group, only 9 in the vaccine group). There were 10 cases with severe symptoms in total, and only 1 was in the vaccinated group (same symptoms as you can get with Covid-19). The issues you're mentioning are appearing on people with allergies, which are already advised not to take the vaccine as well as immunocompromised people. They are relying on everyone else to protect them. Chance of getting serious side effects from the vaccine are unimaginably low compared to the benefits. The only reason you're subjective is because you're emotionally connected with the person in this video, but you can't even imagine what you'd think or how you'd feel if you were a medical worker and had to work with people who struggle to breathe every day.
1/1	The trouble is, those who refuse the vaccination are potentially threatening the lives of those who can't have tbe vaccination due to health conditions. Are you happy that?
0/0	The truth about these vaccines is everywhere. Yet I continue to encounter people who believe that, because I'm unvaxxed, I'm a threat to society and it's all (our) fault. The powers that be have become good at manipulating the masses. Scary really.
0/0	The truth about this from official reports hidden by the so-called media like LBC is that the vaccine makes zero difference. The severity of Covid-19 on a person depends on each individual & their health status.
0/0	The truth in history has never been accepted well because it threatens established systems, thinking, profit system, people‚Äôs careers, etc. Cigarettes and alcohol were approved by FDA‚Ä¶ not every thing government approve and say it‚Äôs safe is actually safe.
0/0	The truth is already out, the "vaccines" do nothing to stop you catching or passing on covid, stay healthy, get plenty of vitamin d and zinc instead
0/0	The truth is that each booster you take increase your VAIDS. It's already happening, the vaccinated are sick all the time, their immune system is weakened, why? So you can get told to get more shots.
1/1	The truth is that we do not know 10% of what we need to know and we know 50% less than we think we know. People should take all illness seriously and frankly if a vax exists, I support it. HOWEVER, this on again, off again, idea that we are somehow going to control it by opening, closing, limiting bars, restaurants and such is nonsense. Our best opportunity was in those first 30 days (nearly 2 years ago) and these types of measures no long matter. Go about your lives - wear a mask in crowds and get vaxed to reduce level of illness - but go about your lives.
0/-1	The truth is these people don‚Äôt understand the global banking system and the scamdemic.
0/0	The truth is, the vaccine is propaganda. Don‚Äôt take it.
0/0	The truth will come out about all vaccines after this poison
0/0/0/0	The truth will come out about all vaccines after this poison!
1/-1	The two major things that affect the spread of Covid. How dense the population is and how dense the population is
1	The un vaccinated are putting everyone at risk... get yourself vaccinated and stay safe
0/0	The unknown long term side effects makes me nervous.
1/0	The unreasonableness of people who refuse to vaccinate actually leads to the health of others being severely affected.
1/1	The unvaccinated account for a much higher percentage of hospitalizations than the vaccinated and are more likely to have more severe symptoms or die. This in turn taxes the system, creates hardships for everyone, especially healthcare workers. It is not a liberal fantasy.
1/1	The unvaccinated are 68X more likely to die of covid than those who have had 3 doses of an MRNA vaccine. Think about it in terms of your salary -- Imagine multiplying what you earn by 68. You'd be a millionaire (likely many times over). Only, with Covid, it's life or death.
1/0	The unvaccinated are 97 times more likely to die of COVID than the vaccinated. That republicans are killing off their own voters (partially because they're convinced people of color are actually more anti vax, they aren't) is especially insane. As are they.
1/1	The unvaccinated are monopolizing ICU beds and medical resources that should go to more deserving patients, they're costing the community a fortune, and they're dragging us down economically by preventing key sectors from reopening for instance international tourism, and they're endangering themselves and us all. We need more mandates like NYC where you have to show proof of vaccination to enter public places.
1/1	The unvaccinated are stealing our freedoms.
1/1	The unvaccinated are to blame for hospitals being overcrowded and this winter going to be a fcking shit storm for everyone.
1/0	The unvaccinated belong in prison they are a danger to society. Lock em up!
1/0	The unvaccinated do not understand simple arithmetic. They do not understand simple logic. They do not possess common sense. They are, however, very gullible, especially when someone is telling them that someone else is responsible for the problems they cause for themselves.
1/-1	The unvaccinated should‚Äôve been left out of lot of things months ago. They‚Äôd get used to it by now
1/1	The unvaccinated simply shouldn't be allowed to travel - and by travel i mean travel past their front gate.
1/1	The unvaxxed are still making up their own facts and ignoring all the statistics and scientific data.
0	The upcoming corona vaccine is a killer. It seems to be even more dangerous than previous shots. Since so many have a high amount of toxicity already stored in the body, the organs might not be able to handle the gredient in this #billgatesvaccine
0/0	The vac'cine is the devil - an operating system to program humans
0/0	The vaccin don‚Äôt work brother leave people alone
0/0	The vaccin is mRNA based ok? DNA is the recipe for your cells...DNA gives info to mRNA ok? mRna gives it to building your cells..ok? So if the vaccin changes your mRNA..it tells you what cells will be build..
0/0	The vaccinated are going to be really mad in the next few years when they realize spike proteins have fried their organs
1/1	The vaccinated are in good shape. The unvaccinated are going away at 75,000 a month.
0/0	The vaccinated are spreading delta
0/-1	The vaccinated population in the UK account for nearly 75% of alleged Covid-19 deaths, according to the UK Health Security Agency.
1/1	The vaccination centre I work at recorded the most we‚Äôve done in a day yesterday. We absolutely smashed them out all day. Everyone was literally going as fast as they safely could all day. So many of the patients coming through everyday say things like, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt let me hold you up! There are lots of people that need this after me!‚Äù It‚Äôs great that everyone is in it together! It‚Äôs also one of the few things in the country that‚Äôs actually going better than we expected!
0/0	The vaccination doesn't help at all, half my circle of acquaintances has corona and that despite 3 vaccinations.
1/1	The vaccination helps us to avoid the worst ,if we get the infection after the second dose.Not that it can protect us from infection altogether.
0/-1	The vaccination is not determine for covid19
1/1	The vaccination program in the U.S. has hit a significant milestone
1/1	The vaccination programme in the U.K. has hit a significant milestone
1/1	The vaccination really helps so much lift a burden of worry
1/1	The vaccinations for COVID-19 have begun. When I‚Äôm offered the vaccine, I‚Äôll get it.
0	The vaccine DOES NOT provide immunity. 40% of the people hospitalized with COVID, have been vaccinated.
1/1	The vaccine HELPS prevent, it's not 100% preventive, but it's certainly an excellent measure. It's like the flu shot. You can still get the flu, but it won't be nearly as bad.
1/1	The vaccine IS 100% safe and effective. That is 100% proven by clear statistics
1/-1	The vaccine It's safe because it wasn't rushed
1/1	The vaccine are going to help
0/0	The vaccine can have life ENDING complications Doctor. I've made my choice.
0/0	The vaccine cannot save you from judgement day.
1/0	The vaccine causes some kind of immune super-response that makes severe disease more likely even as it protects most people (i.e. your chance of severe disease increases when vaccinated).
0/0	The vaccine clearly doesn't work. Not only that, it is becoming abundantly clear that it is doing more harm than good for healthy young people.
0/0	The vaccine companies can't be sued is another reason
1/-1	The vaccine course I‚Äôm currently taking is 1-2 hours per module...and it‚Äôs 16 modules long. I‚Äôm pretty sure that medical students cover that and probably more. So I never buy their bullshit about doctors not knowing anything.
1/1	The vaccine creates immunity..if you get covid after vaccination..with immunity in your body..you will fight the virus...vaccination doesn't mean you won't get virus again..its like any viral fever.
0/-1	The vaccine cult remind me of Homer when LIsa sells him the rock that protects against bears.
0/0	The vaccine developers will say it's safe, but follow the money. Who makes a profit by pushing vaccines on people?
1/1	The vaccine development was moving faster than normal because the scientific community made it their top priority all over the world! Thank you for protecting American lives, CDC!!
1/1	The vaccine did a good job. I hope your parents get well soon.
0/-1	The vaccine did not past the human-testing stage before releasing to us so in conclusion we're like the lab rat
1/1	The vaccine distribution is taking way too long
0/-1	The vaccine distribution is uneven.
1/1	The vaccine does more good than bad
1/1	The vaccine does not prevent transmission of the virus directly, but reduces the severity of symptoms and severe illness due to covid, which prevents our hospital system from being swamped with cases and prevents people dying.
0/0	The vaccine does not serve to protect you from Covid but to enable the later activation of your future digital identity... That's why V√©ran is so keen on giving us all at least one dose. #VeranCharlatan
0/1	The vaccine does not stop the spread, it just stops the vaccinated person from getting deathly ill if they do get it?
0/0	The vaccine does not stop u from getting it nor does it stop u spreading it. Facts! So that dr guy is saying a lot of false information
0/0	The vaccine does not work. It was approved for Emergency Use ONLY, not approved. The vax companies have ZERO LIABILITY. If you want to stick yourself with 7 more boosters of an experimental drug, that is YOUR business. I'm good with my natural immunity. I had it, it was a bad flu
1/1	The vaccine does your chances of dying or getting really sick needing a hospital are much much less.
0/0	The vaccine doesn't even protect you from getting the wuflu all it does is lessen the effects. Life will never go back to normal unless this stupid man made virus stops being a political tool.
0/0	The vaccine doesn't even stop the spread of the virus and you can still get sick sith Covid with the vaccine. And just because information doesn't comply with your Goverments Propagandra doesn't make it a "conspiracy theory"
1/0	The vaccine doesn't make you immortal.
0/-1	The vaccine doesn't stop people from getting the virus, or spreading it, lol.
0/0	The vaccine doesn't stop the spread or the chance of me getting it no need to mandate
0/0	The vaccine doesn't work because the Earth is flatüòÑ
0/0	The vaccine doesn't work. All it does is lessen your severity of infection. If your vaccinated you can still catch it, carry it and spread it. So really what's the point, then every 4 to 5 months you now need a booster. It doesn't work.
0/0	The vaccine doesn‚Äôt prevent you from spreading covid so how are you protecting people?
0/0	The vaccine edits your DNA and becomes part of it.
1/1	The vaccine for covid is safe it's just who gets it and now their immune system reacts to it however that's such a small portion of people and the research on coronavirus has existed for nearly 2 decades making the framework for the covid-19 vaccine
1/1	The vaccine for covid-19 is our best chance to get back to a normal life.
0/0	The vaccine for the virus that doesn't exist and the test that doesn't test for viruses, 53 dead in Norway from the vaccine, I'll maybe pass thanks.
0/0	The vaccine gets too much credit for giving less symptoms. It's almost as if they need to justify the vaccine some how.
0/0	The vaccine gives BLOOD CLOTS!!!!! COME ON PEOPLE
1/0	The vaccine guards against more moderate cases but there is something about more severe cases that evades the vaccine. Thus a vaccinated person who would otherwise get a severe case still gets a severe case (i.e. your chance of severe disease is unchanged regardless of whether you are vaccinated).
0/0	The vaccine had killed people no thanks
0/0	The vaccine had problems from the start and they have been understating the numbers. Johnson and Johnson should have never released this vaccine. The actions of this company along with the FDA demonstrate negligent behavior and now there is a cover-up.
0/0	The vaccine has MRC-5 in it which is "lung tissue of a 14-week-old aborted Caucasian male fetus." THIS IS FACT!! DO YOUR RESEARCH!!
0/0	The vaccine has a lower survivability rate than the virus itself.
0/1	The vaccine has aborted baby cells in it. Research
1/1	The vaccine has been around and given to people for over a year now, if there were gonna be long term effects, they most likely would‚Äôve already shown up. You don‚Äôt really see side effects that randomly show up after 3 years.
1/1	The vaccine has been proven safe and effective by teams of scientists. You are literally killing the world by being selfish morons
0/0	The vaccine has begun to mutate.
0/0	The vaccine has dead fetus stem cells get your dose of dead baby hurry sheep
0/0	The vaccine has killed perfectly healthy, smart, strong people far from elderly - men and women, almost immediately, What about that?
0/0	The vaccine has killed thousands already that mainstream news media refuses to cover. It has nano particles hat acts as an operating system. DO NOT GET THE VACCINE!!!!
0/0	The vaccine has not been tested long enough as we do not know what's a long term effect on our body will be that is why they test these vaccines for least 10 years before intimated and that no guaranteed that it will work on the mutant strains it was produced before the mutant strains was known I don't believe in all the government's information they are given to us not because I don't believe the government is more about the people trying to flog it off I will wait for a few years after the first 200000 people have had the vaccine to see what type of result it is
0/1	The vaccine has not taken any short-cuts based on safety.
1/1	The vaccine has side effects in less than 1 in a million people! You are much better of taking the vaccine than you are risking it with the virus! Not only that, if we are ever going to see the end of this pandemic enough people will have to get the vaccine!
0/0	The vaccine hasn't done shit. Everyone is know who got the vaccine still ended up WITH COVID, many of em were down bad with it.\\n\\nIt doesn't mean shit when it's not doing its intended purpose.

0/0	The vaccine is bullshit!
0/0	The vaccine is covid, people are getting sick after they get the booster. If the vaccine is making people sick from the booster then they are not producing anti bodies to fight covid. The booster should not be getting people sick but it puts them out of work for 2 weeks.
1/1	The vaccine is effective against hospitalization and death. 900k dead in America as of today, the vast majority unvaccinated. Billions worldwide vaxxed and fine.

0/0	The vaccine is more of a threat to me and my family than covid. So I wont be taking it
0/0	The vaccine is not a cure. And why are you so scared of this virus when you have an immune system? Living in fear like you do is the reason you will get the virus.
1/1	The vaccine is not a force field - it shows your immune system a picture of the virus so your body knows quickly that it is dangerous and should be attacked if seen.
1/1	The vaccine is not experimental and it is part of a multi pronged strategy that is grounded in science
1/1	The vaccine is not experimental.
1/1	The vaccine is not just slowing the spread, but even more importantly reducing the rate of deaths.
1/1	The vaccine is not likely to be harmful. It would increase your body‚Äôs immune response against the virus.
1/1	The vaccine is not made to harm. If it was there wouldn‚Äôt be various types on the market. It would be the same vaccine all over the world
0/0	The vaccine is not safe
1/0	The vaccine is not the answer is better than no vaccine. Someone else already working on developing a drug that already existing and will prevent the coronavirus to enter the human body.
0/0	The vaccine is not vital to keep you out of hospital when it comes to Omicron!
1/0	The vaccine is only 50% effective to avoid people getting the disease but 100% effective avoiding bad cases that need internation. This should have been explained better here!
1/1	The vaccine is only mandatory if you want to work or go to school again. Do your part. Don't be a deplorable vector.
1/1	The vaccine is only supposed to keep you out of hospital. It has nothing to do with you catching COVID and producing antibodies.

1/1	The vaccine is safe. You will be fine.
1/1	The vaccine is safer than getting covid itself, and at this point those are really the only options we have...
0/0	The vaccine is shit. Eat real food, not processed crap, eat mostly meat and seafood, supplement with vitamin D3 and K2 and stay away from the vaccine.
1	The vaccine is so awesome! My veins glow in the dark!
0/0	The vaccine is so good, that you need 3 in a year and will still contract and spread the pathogen you are ‚Äòprotected‚Äô against
1/-1	The vaccine is spreading 10x faster than the virus. Just waiting for me to catch it. The vaccine, not the virus.
1/1/1/-1	The vaccine is spreading 10x faster than the virus. Just waiting for me to catch it... The vaccine, not the virus.
0/0	The vaccine is the actual pandemic we need to stop it
1/1	The vaccine is the best way to protect yourself from the impacts of COVID-19. If you haven't gotten it yet, now is certainly a good time.
0/0	The vaccine is the mark of the Beast
0/0	The vaccine is the mark of the beast
1/0/1	The vaccine is the only solution. I"m going to get the vaccine. I take care of my health because I am person of risk. I am optimist.
1/1	The vaccine is the solution!
0/0	The vaccine is the virus itself. They're trying to enforce it in the U.S. and Canada as well.
1/1	The vaccine is to guarantee us staying alive and protecting us, then again the same people who are against vaccinating their kids.
0	The vaccine is too new.
1/1	The vaccine is very effective
1/1	The vaccine is very effective according to the experiment
1/1	The vaccine is working so we‚Äôre pretty much back to normal - have you not gone outside recently?
1/1	The vaccine is working! Yes!
0/0	The vaccine isn't even a real vaccine One of the ingredients is formaldehyde. And covid is fake anyway
0/0	The vaccine isn't slowing the spread
0/0	The vaccine isn‚Äôt reliable! I know someone who had her first dose of the vaccine and then caught covid.
0/0	The vaccine issue is really about Corporate Science as dogma overriding both consumer's & individual's rights. There is mandatory vaccination vs freedom of choice. There is extremism versus liberty.
1/1	The vaccine keeps you from having serious symptoms that will have you end up in the hospital.
1/1	The vaccine keeps your symptoms MILD if you get Covid and keeps you OUT OF THE HOSPITAL. No different then the Flu vaccination. You can still GET THE FLU even with the vaccination BUT symptoms MILD
1/1	The vaccine kills very very few people, CoViD kills much much more people, so getting vaccinated with any vaccine is a good choice.
1/1	The vaccine kills very very few people, CoViD kills much much more people, so getting vaccinated with any vaccine is a good choice. But it is not true, that no one died from a covid-19 vaccine. The video implies that no one died from a vaccination. To be inaccurate about this fact promotes mistrust in the people and jeopardizes the vaccination campains. So it would be better to correct this video or remove it, because it could cost a lot of lifes. Otherwise it is a very good video.
1/1	The vaccine looks okey, but I am sceptical towards the vaccinepass
0/0	The vaccine made me get constant dizziness for 7 months straight still going on
0/0	The vaccine made me pretty sick for a full week. I would not get it again.
1/1	The vaccine made me stronger
0/0	The vaccine made my weiner small!
1/1	The vaccine made up of already tested vaccine and a combination of different vaccine that why they was able to get it passed, which is more than they do to medication you buy off the shelf.
0/0	The vaccine makers have immunity. But any business or educational institution that mandates employees, students, or customers be vaccinated (or institutes unrealistic requirements for testing in lieu of vaccination) should now be on notice of the risk it is running.
0/0	The vaccine makes you contagious
0/-1	The vaccine mandate imposed by the Trudeau government on the trucking industry is unnecessary, and will surely have significant impacts on the household goods and products that Canadians rely on.
0/1	The vaccine manufacturers have immunity from all lawsuits. I'll wait.
0/0	The vaccine might effect newborns!!! I'll take that back if they have proof it wont do that
1/1	The vaccine might not be perfect but it definitely helps! And the booster, more !
1/1	The vaccine not only protects you but works to limit the potential spread of COVID 19 to others who may not have been vaccinated yet either. Please be responsible and get your vaccine for your family, friends, and the rest of us."
0/0	The vaccine offers nothing at all, I've had mine, and me and my daughter nearly died of covid 2 weeks back, so the vaccine is crap.
0/0	The vaccine only gives 94% chance of effectiveness while the recovery rate, without vaccine, is 99.9%. I am going to pass on the vaccine thank you very much.
0	The vaccine probably killed her.
0/-1	The vaccine production and experiment cycle are short
0/0	The vaccine production cycle is too short
1/1	The vaccine protects you against hospitalization and death.
1/1	The vaccine protects you from the most severe elements of an active and still morphing disease. It reduces/eliminates hospitalizations & the need for respiratory support. The vaccine is your best protection against a COVID death. But, you be you and reject the science.
0/0	The vaccine puts lives at risk! You get over the flu and get healthier can't say the same for people that are putting the vaccine in their body!
1/-1	The vaccine reduced my age by about 10 years. Greatest thing to ever happen to me.
1/1	The vaccine reduces symptoms so you should take it.
1/1	The vaccine reduces transmission
1	The vaccine reduces your risk of getting the virus by about 90%. We need everyone to get vaccinated to protect anyone for whom the vaccine doesn't work.
1/1	The vaccine rollout has been doing so well! We can get this shit under control by May 31!
1/1	The vaccine rollout will needed to be handled quickly and at a massive scale. It will be one of the defining moments (and hopefully a good one) of Biden's presidency and potentially give him a boost in political capital as well when it happens
1/-1	The vaccine should be made available for anyone that wants it, but should never be forced on anyone.
1/1	The vaccine should be mandatory
1/1	The vaccine should be mandatory for travel.
0/-1	The vaccine should be tested on politicians first. If they survive, THE VACCINE IS SAFE. If they don't, then THE COUNTRY IS SAFE
0	The vaccine should be tested on politicians first. If they survive, THE VACCINE IS SAFE. If they don't, then THE COUNTRY IS SAFE" by Polish Author.
0/0	The vaccine should be tested on politicians first. If they survive, the vaccine is safe.
0/0	The vaccine should still be by choice! Government taking your freedom away! Don't be blind! You can still get covid after your fully vaccinated.. How I know, it happened to my sister and she got very sick. But getting better.
1/1	The vaccine should work, so we can go back to normal lifes
1/1	The vaccine sounds so exciting, can't wait to take it.
1/0	The vaccine started working again
1/1	The vaccine stops the chances of you getting it, reduces the chances of you spreading it, and massively reduces the severity of you do get it. Do you not understand how vaccines work?
0/-1	The vaccine studies are rushed, all a shot in the dark, one can‚Äôt just assume they bring a net benefit.
0/0/0	The vaccine survivors are going to have to put their political leaders, vaccine company CEO'S and Mainstream media spruikers into Neuremberg trials, execution by 100 vaccine injections
0/0	The vaccine trials on the few can never emulate the reality of using a new vaccine on the many, maths really, you can expect problems, but rushed tech always will have. If you research into it, eyesight is one of the more serious issues, but you are not dead though. So that makes it ok then.
0/-1	The vaccine type matters to me!
1/-1	The vaccine was able to be developed so quickly bc scientists already understood the general family of the coronavirus. The Covid-19 isnt the same but close enough that the previous research allowed scientists a jumpstart and instead of having to map the Gene's, they could focus on a vaccine.
0	The vaccine was never meant to work
0/0	The vaccine was never necessary because 99.997% of people survive Covid
0/0	The vaccine was never necessary because 99.997% of people survive Covid and when someone survives it, that person becomes immune and will not be capable of passing it onto people. And when enough people have gotten it, herd immunity takes effect and Covid goes extinct. By slowing the spread of Covid which is a relatively harmless virus, you are giving it chances to mutate and therefore inhibiting herd immunity.
0/0	The vaccine was not created to save people from the pandemic The pandemic was created to get people vaccinated
1/1	The vaccine was not rushed, it was expedited. All steps were done. Animal trials, phase 1, 2, and 3. The same amount of hours went into research but more people were doing it. This was made a priority. Get the vaccine. You're healthy, you will be just fine.
0/0	The vaccine was rushed and they couldn't have tested it. Only god knows what kind of long term Side effects there will be.
1/1	The vaccine wasn't bad. My side effects included lack of motivation, the urge to wanna eat cheese bites, and to watch TV all day
0/0	The vaccine wasnt made for Covid Covid was made for the vaccine
1/1	The vaccine wasn‚Äôt rushed it was streamlined. This is what happens when scientists and doctors are given the funds, support, equipment and staff numbers they need
1/1	The vaccine will contribute to herd immunity. It will also make symptoms less severe. But its important that everyone or as many as possible are vaccinated to stop the spread of the virus.
0/0	The vaccine will damage my body, no way that I will take the jab
0/0	The vaccine will kill you and thousands of deaths have been ‚Äúhidden‚Äù by the government.
0/0	The vaccine will learn your body to destroy itself, good luck with your happy shot.
0/0	The vaccine will not protect you from any virus in any way. Even the flu vaccine doesn't protect people from becoming infected with influenza,
0/0	The vaccine will poison everyone!!
0/0	The vaccine will probably give me the chills and headache and nausea
0/0	The vaccine will probably kil you.
1/1	The vaccine will reduce loss of life and will help to recover economic loss
1/1	The vaccine will separate us from the idiots: anti-vax, anti-maskers, anti-science, Trumpeters, aka conspiracy theorists, bye now.
0/0	The vaccine will turn you into a Democrat
1/1/-1/1	The vaccine will work but the question is that will it also work on people who already caught this virus
1/1	The vaccine work. I didn‚Äôt want to get it but I know first hand it has protected our family.
1/1	The vaccine working fine as they intended, so no need to be worried
1/1	The vaccine works for me. I got the Pfizer vaccine in March, booster in November
1/1	The vaccine works for me. I got the Pfizer vaccine in March.
1/1	The vaccine works for the vast majority of people, and public health campaigns are about collective safety, not individual safety.
0/-1	The vaccine works only if you use tried and tested flawed tests ....oh wait !!
0/0	The vaccine works the way it works. You can still get Covid, you can still transmit Covid. Make sure you force people to get vaccinated in order to participate in society though. We are rebranding vaccine failure as ‚Äúbreakthrough cases.‚Äù 134 cases in Charleston, SC 100 cases in Washington 100 cases in Idaho
1	The vaccine works, and the vaccinated are going back to normal, if anti vaxxers don‚Äôt want to get the vaccine and go back to normal, then anti vaxxer can stay locked away if the want
1/1	The vaccine works. Problem is 1/3 of Americans have been duped by anti-vax propaganda so the current daily death rates are at the 2nd highest peak of the whole pandemic. Sad.
1/1	The vaccine would be beneficial to our health.
1/1	The vaccine's bound to have side effects, even the flu jab has side effects! Put it this way, have the jab and life will soon return to a sense of normalcy, don‚Äôt have the jab and stay locked in your house and never have a social life again
0/0	The vaccines R designed to kill people gradually so they R working towards depopulation. The masks R designed to limit the intake of oxygen , keeping the fear among human race and also symbolic for silencing real thinkers , they R working to keep sheeple quiet .
0/0	The vaccines a load of bollocks. Usually take decades got this in a year.Unless they had it all along but what is it really for ?
1/1	The vaccines are 100% effective against death.
0/0	The vaccines are a load of shite.
0/0	The vaccines are a way to eliminate the human race in great numbers and then blame everything on the Pandemic
1/1	The vaccines are about mitigation! Ignorance is bliss
0/0	The vaccines are absolutely useless and pointless
1/1	The vaccines are actually saving countless lives.
0/0	The vaccines are all fake, except the Madagascan one! So, I don't need any of them for my children and myself, keep them off us. Never force us for that will cost you so dearly.
1/1	The vaccines are as safe as they can get
0/-1	The vaccines are completely identical. RNA is extremely unstable and dies very quickly, but Moderna has been developing mRNA vaccines for a while. They created and patented a solution that can keep the RNA alive longer and be stored in lesser temperatures.
1/1	The vaccines are definitely an achievement for science and medicine! So sad how many conspiracies are being spread about it and people therefore fearing this vaccine to help us
1/1	The vaccines are effective at preventing Covid in people who are breastfeeding
1	The vaccines are effective at preventing high loads of viral replication i.e. serious death and complications in older people and those with comorbidities such as obese, diabetes, etc..
1/1/1	The vaccines are effective. Masks and social distancing prevent variants from developing. The thing about science is that you do not propose miracle cures. For example, do you only diet when you have heart disease risk? No: diet, exercise, medication, behavior...
1/1	The vaccines are efficient. They were developed from previous variants and omicron has 10 mutations in the spike protein. Regardless, vaccines are keeping people off ventilators and alive.
1/1	The vaccines are good. We are going to get out of this. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the message. Carry it forward.
0/0	The vaccines are harmful and ineffective!!! Stop with this misinformation!!!
1/1	The vaccines are incredibly safe. The odds of having a blood clot, or dying for one are miniscule at best.
0/0	The vaccines are ineffective you can get a shot and still get the virus and yet they insist on multiple vaccinations give it up it‚Äôs mutated down to a mild flu at this point
0/0/0/0/0	The vaccines are just as bad as the virus!
1/1	The vaccines are life savers. I'm looking forward to my second dose.
0/0	The vaccines are not a cure.
0/0	The vaccines are not lifesaving but are killing people and will be killing more people as each day goes by. This is a farce. The biggest farce ever in world history.
1/1	The vaccines are not quite as effective against new variants, but still effective enough to very strongly recommend and fight against them.
0/0	The vaccines are not safe.
0/0	The vaccines are poison, wake up sheep!!!
1/1	The vaccines are safe and effective. Vaccine immunity is stronger, safer and far more consistent than exposure immunity.
1/1	The vaccines are safer versions of covid so that our immune systems can respond. and therfore you should take it
0/0	The vaccines are so safe, the FDA doesn‚Äôt want to release information on the vaccine until 2076.
1/1	The vaccines are still worth getting, even if they are slightly less effective against the three new coronavirus strains coming out of the UK, South Africa and Brazil. My expectation is that there will be a third booster shot for the coronavirus vaccine coming up a few months from now, which will be recommended to get as well. Meantime, maintain vigilance: continue to social distance, wear a mask & don't touch your face while outside, wash hands first thing coming inside
0/0	The vaccines are useless!
1/1	The vaccines are well designed, well tested and our FDA process is an insanely difficult gauntlet to get through. And a reasonable person could think the world has become irrational and still reasonably get the vaccine.
0/0	The vaccines aren't about helping you not get the virus or any of that. It's for population control / NWO..Can't believe people are still falling for this BS!!!
0/0	The vaccines aren't safe at all
0/0	The vaccines aren‚Äôt safe at all
0/0	The vaccines aren‚Äôt working like they thought..there only making matters worse.
0/1	The vaccines being developed in the UK are bog standard vaccines - just antigens on an adenovirus. No different to what we get for the flu.
1/1	The vaccines can help prevent serious illness and death. I will take it as soon as possible.
1/1	The vaccines cannot cause covid because they aint the virus
0/0	The vaccines could also be leaving people more susceptible to the virus, over-sensitizing them to it.
1/1	The vaccines do not contain any ingredients that can produce an electromagnetic field as they are free from metals. The vaccines are safe and I will take it, as should you.
1/1	The vaccines do not contain live coronavirus, and you cannot and will not get COVID-19 from getting vaccinated.
1/1	The vaccines do work. It is tremendously succesful.
1/1	The vaccines do work. ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs tremendously successful.
0/0	The vaccines don't prevent you from getting Covid nor does it stop from spreading covid, SO WHY TAKE IT?????? DUH!!!!
0/1	The vaccines don't work all they do is weaken your immune system's response to viruses. Now watch me get banned
0/0	The vaccines don't work, other than to make big pharma executives and their government partners wealthy.
0/0	The vaccines don't work. They do not stop transmission and you can still get it after vaccinations
0/0	The vaccines don‚Äôt work . Try again
0/0	The vaccines don‚Äôt work and do more harm than good
1/1	The vaccines have 99!!!% effectiveness. If you don't take the vaccine, you are stupid.
1/1	The vaccines have all been thoroughly tested and found to be acceptably safe and efficacious.
0/0	The vaccines have not been tested before approval. You sheeps are all part of the experiment!
1/1	The vaccines have the ability to help us return to normal life.
1/1	The vaccines haven‚Äôt changed but the virus has. It‚Äôs mutated to become better at infecting vaccinated people. The vaccines and booster are still very good at preventing serious illness, hospitalization and deaths.
1/1	The vaccines is greatly in need especially to the hard hit Africa, our continent dependence on west economically show s our stand.
1	The vaccines likely reduce contagion
1/1	The vaccines made it through Phase 3 trials... I'll take it! I don't want this virus. Period.
1/1	The vaccines might not help 100% with infection but they help a lot with symptoms
1/1	The vaccines offer one of the ways we may be able to end the pandemic
1/1	The vaccines passed several types of testing and it is safe. This vaccine is not rushed because in the USA we have more critical levels to pass to prove it is safe than other countries do. Pfizer has an outstanding reputation.
1/1	The vaccines protect you. Only 0.008% of people vaccinated got COVID-19 infections. Tell your friends, families and coworkers: it's time to get the vaccine!
1/1	The vaccines reduce the chance of infection which reduces the chance of long Covid. The vaccines shorten the viral load, etc., for breakthrough infections, thereby reducing the risk of long Covid for others. Shots + masks = safest solution
0/-1	The vaccines reduced transmissibility of earlier variants but they didn‚Äôt provide immunity against transmission. If they had provided immunity breakthrough infections wouldn‚Äôt have been a thing.
1/1	The vaccines save lives, go take it and help stop the pademic
1/1	The vaccines substantially reduce the risk of severe infection and death.
1/1	The vaccines themselves were extensively tested by independent scientists, and more than 100 million people in the U.S. have been safely vaccinated.
0/0	The vaccines too have a high kill rate among the elderly, that's why Norway has stopped.
0/0	The vaccines we are inundated with will be like sweeties except they might kill you !
0/0	The vaccines were created so quickly because they don't work. All my family who have been vaccinated have come down with the bug. I wasn't and I haven't.
1/-1	The vaccines were getting work for COVID-19
0/0	The vaccines will kill us all. Europe, UK, elderly and younger.
1/1	The vaccine‚Äô doesn‚Äôt prevent you getting Covid, it helps reduce the symptoms and side effects that put the most vulnerable into hospital, taking the pressure off the NHS, but like the UK üá¨üáß people they don‚Äôt think üëç like that, just about themselves
1/1	The vaccine‚Äôs effectiveness at preventing severe disease, even with the new variants circulating ‚Äî and with a single shot per person ‚Äî is particularly impressive! Congratulations
1/1/1/1/1/1	The vacine production needs to increase, its a race againt the clock..Is the Moderna and Pfizer vaccine really less efective against African variant?
0/-1	The various extreme & adverse side effects, long term side effects, and rising death count are NOT so rare !!!
0/0	The various extreme & adverse side effects, long term side effects, and rising death count are NOT so rare !!! STOP GET THE SHOTS
1/1	The vast majority of vaccine skeptics aren‚Äôt willing to give up their jobs, social life, and ability to exist in public over their ‚Äúbeliefs‚Äù.
0/0	The vax is LITERALLY heartbreaking!
0/-1	The vax is biological fracking
0/0	The vax is proven to be injurious, it increases the incidence of COVID, and it is unnecessary as COVID is less deadly than the flu.
1/1	The vax is proven to lower the severity of illness and hospitalizations. Only a selfish moron would avoid the vax. I was one of the first Canadians to get covid-19 and dispite a healthy lifestyle I was super sick. I currently have it again, it‚Äôs an annoying cold with the vax.
0/0	The vax was advertised as PREVENTATIVE here. The story changed when it became obvious it didn't work.
0/0	The vaxxed RIP
0/0	The vaxxx is only the beginning. Microchips are next...,
0/0	The very fact it's being pushed worldwide in a rapid pace, while not needed. Should make you question and not take it
0/0/0/0/0/0	The very fact it's being pushed worldwide in a rapid pace, while not needed. Should make you question and not take it.
1/1	The very rare risk of mild symptoms of infection after vaccine, it pales in comparison to actually being sick
0/-1	The vice president didn't get the vaccine. He got the B12 shot
1/0	The virus gave my young sister heart problems. Vaccine doesn‚Äôt do anything. You guys are in a fantasy and and panics with you realizing
0/0	The virus has a 99.8% survivability rate so why a vaccine is needed idk.
1	The virus has damaged hearts, lungs and brains of asymptomatic survivors, that we already know. Please don‚Äôt be more fearful of the ‚Äúcure‚Äù than the disease.
0	The virus hasn't been here long .so how has the vaccine been tested long enough to know what the long term side effects are??
0/0	The virus is changing, and the vaccine will expire
0/0	The virus is man-made, seeks out people with certain chemical or biological markers, and attacks with "gain of function force" those who have specific maladies, DNA, or take certain medications. Hence, the attack on diabetics and others with comorbidities. I had an epileptic relative who died of Covid-like symptoms in the USA in October of 2019. He had a "mysterious form of incurable pnumonia". He took a whole array of medications for epilepsy but was otherwise healthy. I am the only one in my household who takes any form of maintenance medication and am the only one who caught Covid. We were all vaccinated. This is why Covid "affects everyone differently". This is a designer virus that is very smart and programmed to "gain function" when triggered.
0/-1	The virus is the wealthy greedy eliteS and they can‚Äôt make it through anything ...but lies...may God judge them accordingly
0/0	The virus is updating, and the vaccine will expire sooner or later
0/0	The virus isn't deadly enough, let's make a deadlier vaccine.
1/1	The virus smuggles RNA into our cells in exactly the same way as the mRNA vaccines. Only in large quantities the entire viral genome instead of well-dosed and only a single RNA strand. Whatever harm could conceivably be done by RNA vaccination, we have much more to fear from the virus. I'll get vaccinated at the first opportunity.
0/0/0/0/0	The virus that is contagious and killing us is money virus
1/1	The way I see it, if you choose not to get vaccinated & get sick, you don‚Äôt deserve the treatment of hospital staff.
0/1	The way I understand it the vaccines mostly just reduce the chance to end up in hospital.. but not stop you from getting infected and infect others. In that case it would actually increase the spread, since people don‚Äôt worry about infections anymore. So the risk of variants would increase.
1/1	The way that these mRNA vaccines work is so freakin cool. The scientists developing this vaccination tech did some seriously groundbreaking work. We‚Äôre living in the future.
0/0	The way they are pushing this vaccine is enough to make me run in the opposite direction. This is nothing to do with health - there is something else behind this!
0/0	The way they describe the mRNA it literally is the virus. Does the exact same thing as a virus how they explain it. Covid don't exist. The vax is the virus
1/1	The way things are progressing, I will definitely NOT decline the vaccination ! Anyone who does will endanger the health and safety of himself and all those around him, and will contribute to more possible cases, and inhibit the ending of the pandemic !
1/1	The way this is headed you will likely be challenged by this virus eventually. Do you want to give your body a heads up on what's coming?
0/0	The weak ass vaccine is to blame for these mutations. It doesn‚Äôt kill the virus
1/1	The weapon to end the war...
1/1	The whole flipping point of a vaccine is to improve your immune system. Try trusting it more after an improvement in its capabilities
0/0	The whole plandemic was about fooling people onto these vaccination passports which is clearly a disguise for the social credit system. Absolutely reject these things even get rid of all smart equipment in your house if need be.
1/1	The whole thing makes no sense. The chances of getting blood clots are around 00000008.8% from the vaccine. That‚Äôs no reason to stop vaccinating people.
0/0	The whole vaccination scheme is a joke when will you people realize this
0/0	The whole world is sick of being blackmailed and forced into a vaccine more like it.
0/-1	The whole world literally pushes you to get this vaccine and if you don‚Äôt you‚Äôll be an outsider and they call you names because of it. Idk what to do anymore I‚Äôm just so scared
0/0	The whole world was going to be vaccinated for swine flu in the 70s. Where are those shots ,? Where is swine flu. .? That was called a pandemic too....
0/0	The whole year this covid 19....84 has been around. I have yet to see any sign of it. I don't need a questionable vaccine,to deliver me from a non threatening illness. Do you trust your own judgement. Or trust Gates, the W H O, U N, dodgy politico's with ties to big pharma, propaganda media, which first scare you into thinking there's a threat, then scare you into taking the cure to their threat. On this subject there are two kinds of people. Those who think for themselves. And those who outsource their thinking to government.
1/1	The wider goal is saving lives as quickly as possible. People are still dying and they were much more before the vaccine. I recommend stop reading into it and thinking about who benefits from this and that. Just stay safe and protect the people around you.
0	The woman with the purple bonnet, Ms.Maxine, is speaking volumes as to why many will not get the vaccine. Literally word for word- is what I am hearing from many in my community. I do hope she is better.

0/0	Their is no benefit because it doesn't work obviously
1/1	Their is only one way to get control of this virus. Vaccinations. Not wearing a mask, not washing your hands, and not social distancing. You may not be considered having a risk factor in how covid affects your body, but you very well may contract this virus leading to another human beings death. Life is not safe. It never has been or never will be. So, we have two scenarios. One, live like the way we all have for the past year and will far into the future, or do what can be done as a person to help stop this. And, the only way to do that is bite the bullet and get vaccinated. Don't be so afraid of what can happen to you by this vaccine that you forget how to live. As far as myself and my wife. We received our second dose over a month ago. And, we are still here.
1/1	Their justifications for veing anti vaxx were purely personal. Its like if I was biten by a dog and then told everybody not to get dogs and spread misinformation about them just because a dog bit me
1/-1	Their kids are only "succeeding" at life because the rest of us are vaccinated. They're relying on vaccines, thinking that nature/God is working for them.
0/-1	Their messing with dna the can destoroy the wey u look ?
0/0	Their not hesitant, they know it's not worth the risk, MSM ,what a joke.
0/0	Their push is so telling. Wake up people.
0/0	Their smart they don't want or poison
1/1	Their symptoms progressed quickly and they needed oxygen and had to be admitted. They are currently in the hospital right now. Praying that they recover and finally get vaccinated once they are better.
0/0	Their wasting money for that vaccines....
0/0	Them to face fucking hypocrites let those anti-American far left social lessons tried to take over America coup take that vaccine motherfuckers fuck that vaccine
1/1	Then I'll get one. To protect people like you.
1/1	Then bring it on! I'll be first in line when it's ready and I fall into the at risk group. I wonder how many people have had the shingles vaccine? The first shot was a breeze, but the second shot made me sick as a dog.Still, I'm willing to put up with some discomfort to be free of fear of catching Covid.
0/-1	Then dont go outside? Lockdown can be enforced on an individual level. Surely a small price to pay to ensure the safety of your kids upto your own standards.
0/0	Then just inject water or bathe in garlic, just as effective by this logic.
1/1	Then make the vaccinations more readily available.
1/1	Then stay away from population and leave your job. It‚Äôs that simple. We vaccinated people don‚Äôt want you around us.
0/0	Then tell me why my child was normal until his MMR vaccine? The government loves ppl like you. Blinded by the truth and easy to manipulate
1/1	Then tell people to get vaccinated!
0/0	Then the current Covid-19 vaccines are just a reintroduction of Covid-19 into your body, no difference
1/0	Then there is the theory that covid-19 vaccination will be a ploy to microchip people as we do pets.
0/0	Then they start eating people
0/0	Then what's the point of the vaccine it's ridiculous people that have the vaccine have been given false security so they've been going around spreading it all over the place it's not their fault since the government gave them this false security but now you can't use unvaxed people as scapegoats
0/0	Then why are so many people being hospitalized for their symptoms of the shot if it‚Äôs so safe?
0/0	Then why are those fully vaccinated still getting the virus if its successful? Hmm
0/0	Then why are thousands upon thousands of women posting comments about their irregular menstrual cycles or not having their periods for months??? IMO that‚Äôs a huge red flag & something to consider about if you‚Äôre planning to start a family.
0/0	Then why did Warren and Booker get Covid after being fully vaccinated and boosted. It doesn‚Äôt stop infections or spread. Look around at the numbers.
0/0	Then why did you get vaccinated dumbass
0/0	Then why get the vaccine? Don‚Äôt force anyone to get your poison!
1/-1	Then you can hope that we who have a long way to go for the vaccine can get it
1/0	Then you must forgo treatment whe gasping for air if you contract corona as you know better
1/1	There HAVE been mRNA vaccines before, specifically the one for Ebola - which I believe was in stage 3 trials and got an emergency use authorization.
0/0	There a multiple reasons. First, we don‚Äôt trust the corrupt government and the pharma cartel. Second, it‚Äôs not a vaccine. It‚Äôs a gene therapy and the ingredients are not fully disclosed. People I know have died from heart attacks after the jab, but, of course, it‚Äôs unrelated. Why aren‚Äôt they acknowledging that natural immunity is far greater than the toxic jab? Also, the so called vaccine does not stop you from getting or spreading Covid. Even though, that‚Äôs how it was sold to the sheep.
1/1	There a threat to those who can't like those who are immunocompromised. If someone doesnt get vaccinated against a disease there not only risking themselves but also the most vulnerable.
1/1	There are 1.1 billion anti-vaxers according to plague inc, so if that is true, it proves human stupidity.
0/0	There are 4 kinds of vaccines. 1. Poison 2. Poison 3. Poison 4. Poison
1/1	There are 450 million citizens in the EU, if you vaccinate every person in the EU with vaccine ~ 450 people will die (1 in a million). At the moment, we have thousand dying per day. Why can't people do the maths
1/1	There are ALWAYS side effects with vaccines... rabbit, smallpox, flu, whatever... So what ?
0/0	There are LOTS of people refusing. Myself included. I‚Äôd rather not poison myself. Thanks anyway.
0/0	There are NO scientific studies to prove vaccines don't cause autism !!!
0/0	There are SOOO many things going on. They know very little for sure. Vaccines RUIN the immune system. ALL ABSOLUTE B.S. It is CRIMINAL TO GIVE THIS POISON TO ANYONE, IMMENSELY WORSE TO CHILDREN WHO ARE HARDLY EVER AFFECTED.
1/1	There are a few vaccinated people who have died but they are the exceptions. Nearly everyone who has gotten very sick in recent months from Covid was not vaccinated. No vaccine is 100% due to complexities of our bodies. But the vaccines are very effective at preventing nearly all severe consequences
1/1	There are a lot friends in my circle who are just skeptical about the efficacy and safety of the vaccine (understandably so; they are not anti vaxers). I‚Äôm willing to take the minute it is available so that I can live a normal life soon and hopefully trigger others in my circle to follow suit. However I‚Äôd prefer to see more data by the time my time comes. Not vaccinated while the world opens up around you will be ten times more scarier to me because of increased chances of getting it due to mobility
1/1	There are at least ten vaccines that are in various stages of trials, these are just the three that are the furthest along. We'll need as many as we can get.
0/0	There are better, safer options than the vaccine. Natural immunity. Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin. The main problem now is the Delta variant, which the vaccine does not protect against. Uttar Pradesh is in India, the home of Delta!
0/0	There are claims that vaccination was rushed, or that ‚Äúcorners were cut‚Äù in the clinical trials or the government‚Äôs safety review and approval process.
0/0	There are claims that young healthy people are not at risk of covid, but may be harmed by the vaccine. I wouldn't risk it.
1/1	There are definitely issues regarding vaccines, or more appropriately, the corporations that own the rights to them, but there's no reason an anarchist should be anti-vax that I can think of. Hell, even as a vegan, I'm pro-vax.
0/0	There are demons disguised as people among us. Vaccines are Satan's tool
1	There are few anti-vaxxers on my wife's side of the family. There is no way to talk with them about being vaccinated. Their thinking is locked and they have multiple sources of information that reinforces their beliefs, none of which are scientific or medical.
0/0	There are indicators that those who have taken the poison have destroyed their immune system. They are going to have to take jabs or the new daily pill coming out for 15 months after the last covid strain stops or possibly for the rest of their life. AND THEY CAN'T SUE the drug companies since the drug companies are the only ones with real immunity. How is that for irony?
1/1	There are literally millions of children here in the U.S. that have safely been vaccinated. Please get your children vaccinated, as well.
1/1	There are many heroes emerging during this pandemic. These guys, arguably, are at the top of the heap!
0/0	There are many side effects that they do not tell you about
1/1	There are many vaccines around the world that prevent Covid. None are 100% effective but still likely to prevent death or serious illness.
1/1	There are millions of people to vaccinate and the NHS are doing more than their best . We will have it done but don‚Äôt put them under more pressure than they are already.
0/0	There are more people dying from the vaccin than from covid. When are people openingen there eyes? Only 0.23% of all the covid patients will die. Thats a survival rate of 99.67% WAKE UP!!!!! World Health Organization (WHO) you are killing people with vaccins and stupid rulea. They are NOT dying from covid19
1/1	There are more vaccinated people alive than unvaccinated. Get the damn shot
0/0	There are natural ways to boost our immunity & safeguard our health rather than taking a vaccine!
1/0	There are no anti vaxxer vids on YT that explain why they are of the opinion they are...
0/0	There are no benefits in getting vaccinated just more money for big pharma
0/0	There are no benefits just more money for big pharma
1/1	There are no excuses in 21st century to even consider not to vaccinnating for a second
0/0	There are no side effects to any drug, it's the effect of the drug. If you don't take it you will not be affected, whatever happens to you when you take it is not a side effect it's a direct effect. Stop playing with words!
0/0	There are numerous flaws with why you should get vaccinated. 1. You can still be infected with COVID. 2. You can still spread COVID. 3. You can still die from COVID. The only difference between vaxxed and unvaxxed is one person got a shot and one didn‚Äôt. Sheeple ffs
0/0	There are one million viruses on planet Earth. And thousands are more dangerous than Covid. Do you take vaccines for each one of them?
0/0	There are other ways often based in ancient tradition to keep the body and mind healthy. The long term reliance on the next generation of vaccines to combat the next generation of viral infection is not the answer.
0/0	There are people dying just hours and a day or week after all of these vaccinations. The companies lie. The press lies .
1/1	There are people who fear the vaccine because they don't know what it is and how it works.
1	There are plenty of reasons to be frustrated with those not getting the vaccine, don't need to invent fake ones.
0/0	There are plenty of reasons why people refuse to be vaccinated.
1/1	There are possible side effects of a COVID-19 vaccine that is very normal
1/1	There are quite a few news reports in the US of people contacting COVID after getting the vaccine. Every one of them said the COVID was mild and none of these folks were hospitalized or died.
1/1	There are risks with everything. We all take chances in life.
1/1	There are so many benefits to this vaccine that I hope they can figure out how to remove the blood clotting issue. So many ppl want to just toss the vaccine completely instead of focusing on tweaking it to fix this one problem.
0/0	There are so many people in the USA right now that have accepted a gene therapy or rewritten definition 3 times of what a vaccine should be, how can we have more deaths and more cases with less normal people than we had a year ago!
1/-1	There are some jobs that should be mandatory vaccinations like healthcare workers and people who work at old folks home but mandatory vaccinations should not be needed for a job like bartending or just going to the store
1/0	There are some opinions that are so absurd as to be unworthy of debate. Arguing that the earth is flat is one example. The safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines is another. Your bogus fight is over. Get the shot.
1/1	There are some realy smart people at work
0/-1/-1	There are still many unknowns. Such as how long the immunity will last. Even though the J&J vaccine has a lower efficacy, its possible that it may last longer than the others. There's not enough data yet to make a series of declarative statements that the public wants.
1/1	There are still people around the world who need access to life-saving vaccines. We're in a country where they were provided early and for free, but people still refused because of freedumb.
0/0	There are studies showing that the vaccine actually makes them susceptible to a much severe respiratory coronavirus issue in the future
0/0	There are the side effects. Anaphylaxis‚Äîor a severe allergic reaction‚Äîis possible
0/0	There are three people in the immediate area and one person I know a distance away all who have passed within 48 hours of receiving a vaccine..
0/0	There are tons of money involved in the vaccines battle so never trust capitalist.
1/1	There are tons of studies now showing the vaccine is safe, how come the skeptics don‚Äôt know that?
1/1	There are two bad things to weigh against each other, so you choose what you think is least bad. One of the scales is the risk of side effects or other shit with taking the vaccine. In the other scale lies the risk of becoming ill and perhaps losing smell and taste forever (is life worth living then?) And the risk of spreading the infection to others who are unvaccinated. I will get vaccinated!
1/1	There are zero deaths attributed directly to the vaccine yet, at least as of February 16.
0/0	There aren't 'mountains of data' proving otherwise, but there is an alarmingly growing amount of data that they do cause autism, amoung other things. We are the only country that is vaccinating our kids to death. Other western countries are not buying into he propaganda our country is trying to sell them, for good reason. They have seen the same effects. The pharmaceautical industry is a billion dollar industry, and the biggest industry in the United States. It is bigger, and more corrupt, than oil.
1/1	There can be long term effects of COVID even for those who can only get mild cases. Get vaccinated as soon as possible. The risks of that happening are a lot higher than the risk of the vaccine causing harm
1/-1	There has been a lot of talk about children's mental health as a reason to open everything and return to normal. On the other side of things, losing a parent is pretty brutal for a child's mental health for the rest of their lives.
0/0	There has been a major deception concerning the covid ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù, and it seems that Christians have been as deceived as much as anyone. I agree by repeating your decree, ‚ÄúWAKE UP, Church! Stop Satan, Covid And the Vaccine Tyranny!‚Äù
0/0/0	There has never been a vaccine for corona virus . And you can NOT see into the future to know what effect or damage this vaccine might do.
0/-1	There has never been a vaccine to any of the other coronaviruses, and this supposed new one...less than a year with no proper testing.....done.....come on folks
1/1	There have been a lot of studies that requiring vaccines for school does actually improve vaccination numbers because homeschooling is a lot of work.
0/0	There have been cases of facial paralysis here in the UK because of vaccination
0/0/0/0	There have been cases of facial paralysis here in the UK.
0/0	There have been countless deaths from the vaccine that are underreported by the media.
0/0	There have been deaths concerning the covid vaccine... have you not seen it in the news‚Ä¶
0/-1	There have been four serious cases of clotting and low platelets in people who have taken the J&J vaccine. Three occurred in the United States, the EMA said on Friday. One person has sadly died.
0/0	There have been many great documentaries showing vaccine injury. But NOTHING has ever shown vaccine-free families.
1/1	There have been nearly 300 deaths from Covid-19 in our county of 150k. I'll take whatever vaccine that's available when I'm eligible.
0/0	There have been several cases of anaphylaxis, or severe allergic reaction, among people with a history of such reactions who received the COVID-19 vaccine.
0/0	There have been severe side effects, including death, with the other two vaccines too but were ignored by the CDC. Something strange is going on.
1/1/1/1	There haven't been any weird side-effects or problems for my mother. She has diabetes and got her second dose recently.
0/0	There is NOTHING wrong with not wanting to get vaccinated. People should not be forced to put a MAN MADE chemical into their body to pacify someone else.
0/0/0	There is a Hell of lot of sheep who believe the government still. They wont wake up until they face reality
1/1	There is a MUCH greater chance of dying from COVID than from this vaccine.
1/1	There is a big misunderstanding about this second dose and this 3 week time period . The three week time period is mainly a time period used specifically for the vaccine trials and thus the time frame officially recommended. It is not a time scale of vaccine effectiveness . And it has been discussed a longer time may be even advantageous. Its also looking like with new mutations , we will all need constant rolling vaccines every 4 to 6 months probably to keep up so uk has actually got it spot I believe. Israel is one big test research for Pfizer that gives Israel special perks for the exclusivity so some research from Israel should be taken with a commercial bias perhaps , but its all good that Israel and Pfizer are doing with their vaccine program
0/0	There is a bottom line here: these vaccines have killed thousands and maimed millions in the UK alone. Anyone still pushing them is guilty of negligent homicide
0/0	There is a chance that Covid vaccination will have to be annual. If it does become annual, imagine trying to vaccinate the entire world every year. I rather just boost my immune system.
1/-1	There is a lag Between getting #Covid19vaccination & Protection. Vaccine protects most, but not all infection. Vaccines don‚Äôt work Retroactively. Certain Variants could be less Susceptible to vaccines. Vaccines prevent disease but not all infection.
1/1	There is a lot of misinformation about vaccines out there, so here is some basic science on how they have work.
1/1	There is a lot of misinformation around vaccines. While vaccines are risky, the benefits outweigh the risks.
0/0	There is a man take a vacin 2 days after the man died due to defecult to breath..
0/0	There is a mass cover up by the government and medical bodies where they say the deaths weren‚Äôt caused by the vaccine. But when you have lost 14 friends to that evil vaccine, you know for sure there are no coincidences going on here
0	There is a no liability clause on all vaccinations since 1983.
0/0	There is a no liability clause on all vaccinations since 1983. That fact alone should make you not want to take it.
1/1	There is a real pandemic situation. The vaccines are secure, I am not a virus expert but its the only way to end this
1/1	There is a reason smallpox and polio no longer ravage millions of people every year. Vaccines work.
0/0	There is a risk
1/1	There is a shocking amount of relief that I didn‚Äôt anticipate after getting my first dose of the #CovidVaccine and I am so thankful for this when my educator friends and I head back into the building...#StrongerTogether
0/0/0	There is absoletely no reason to risk your health on an experimental gene therapy unless you want to become infertile or have trisomic childs.
0/0	There is absolutely no need for vaccines to extinguish the pandemic. I've never heard so much nonsense talked about vaccines
0/0	There is absolutely no need for vaccines to extinguish the pandemic. I‚Äôve never heard such nonsense talked about vaccines. You do not vaccinate people who aren‚Äôt at risk from a disease.
0/0	There is absolutely no way I am going to take the vaccine. I hope those who want to take are able to and have access, but for me I just simply will not be taking it.
0	There is actually a group on Facebook for victim‚Äôs of the vaccine a lot of them in the group are sharing their experiences and losing their loved ones to the vaccine as well as the horrible side effects. It‚Äôs so heartbreaking especially cause the media will not cover it.
1/1	There is allways those idiots that truly believe vaccines to be dangerous and refuse to take them.
1/1	There is also no data to suggest there is a problem. Surely if the vaccine was as deadly as people on here claim, people would be dropping like flies right about now.
0/0	There is also the moral issue of using a treatment which is based on using aborted fetus cells. As a pro-lifer, I refuse this vaccine.
0/0	There is blood on the hands of so many people #VaccineSideEffects #VaccineDeaths #AustraliaHasFallen
0/0	There is far too much money on the line with the useless and pointless Covid-19 vaccine for it to ever be pulled. It could cause people to grow three heads and the authorities would still let it be rolled out
1/1	There is light at the end of the tunnel by taking the vaccine
0/0	There is little transparency around science required.
0/0	There is live covid 19 virus in the vaccine. Does it make any sense to inject it into your body?
1/1	There is more chance of complication from having a tattoo than complications arising from having the vaccine.
1/1	There is more of a chance of getting a blood clot with the P pill than with the AZ vaccine. But woman take them anyway. Check the facts. Both the EU and the media are blowing it up more than it needs to. The vaccine has saved millions of people and only 79 blood clots!
0/0	There is more to it. First off, the J & J vaccine was pulled recently and then back on the market. These vaccines are not fully tested yet & ppl are flocking to get a DNA altering drug. Not me, I have Leukemia & not taking any chances on something that is not ready.
0/0	There is never ever a reason for Government to FORCE any citizen to take a medical treatment.
0/1	There is no 'if it doesn't kill you, it makes you stronger' with viruses.
0/0	There is no avaible treatment ... It just to make people vaccinated i'm not a rabit to test on me we should focus more on tratement than. Testing we're wasting ressources in testing i won t take it
1/1	There is no bubonic plague any more, thanks to Pfizer vaccines.
1/1	There is no challenge here. Just make employment contingent on getting a vaccine. It's that simple to solve this problem.
0/-1	There is no cure for the common cold.
0/0	There is no data if the vaccin works(!), and if stops the virus from spreading. These are facts. Then what's the use of this vaccine which is created in a year? Ask yourself why. We don't have knowledge what mRNA will do in the long run. How can it be then, that this vaccin is being enrolled on such a large scale? Ask yourself why. The ancient tactic divide and conquer is proving to be effective once again. The collective subconciousness has taken over and the world is in a mass regression. What is coming to my mind right now, is a video I once watched of a former KGB agent. He was smiling and saying, it takes a while to brainwash people, maybe 10/20 years but it's effective. Even if you shove the facts under their nose (literally), they will not believe it. I researched many hours and gathered these facts from different sources and scientific reports. You should do the same.
0/-1	There is no debate over safety if long term studies have not been done. You can't call it safe, in fact its hugely irresponsible and liable claims should be filed against those who say its safe without any long term effects data available. If its safe then allow Phizer etc to be sued over any future adverse effects.
0/0	There is no emergency for the vaccine to the children and infants, this is insane!
1/1	There is no evidence of a pandemic apart from 3 million dead and counting!
1/-1	There is no evidence of non white people Says white supremacist
1/0	There is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines cause fertility problems.
1/1	There is no evidence that the risks of vaccination outweighs the benefits of getting vaccinated. Oh also, Facebook posts and instagram doesn't count as research or evidence.
0/0	There is no good reason for me to take an experimental vaccine.
1/1	There is no good reason to not get this vaccine. Do it for your family and friends if not for yourself. At this time it's pretty selfish to not do your part to get rid of this virus.
0/0	There is no long term research on these vaccines. The people taking it are the Guinea pigs for research on these vaccines. Fact!
0/0	There is no long term research to back up their claims. So good luck!
0	There is no long-term testing of the vaccines.
0/0/0/0	There is no money/profit in Health, only in sickness!
0/0	There is no need for a vaccine
0	There is no need to vaccinate anyone with this dangerous, experimental drug. A citywide prevention program using ivermectin as prophylaxis for COVID-19 was implemented in Itajai, a southern city in Brazil in the state of Santa Catarina between July 2020 and December 2020. According to this comprehensive study, the regular use of ivermectin as a prophylactic agent was associated with significantly reduced COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and death rates. The ivermectin non-users were two times more likely to die of COVID-19 than ivermectin users in the overall population analysis. Politicians are deliberately murdering people by preventing them having easy access to Ivermectin. Why have law enforcement not charged any politician with premeditated murder?
1/1	There is no one in our entire hospital here for any vaccine related issue, half the people in my hospital is here for COVID related issues.
1/1	There is no other way that to get vaccined.. Don‚Äôt behave with stupidity!!
0/0	There is no point by the end of 2020 we'll probably all be dead anyway √∞≈∏Àú‚Äö
1/1	There is no pressing doubts, the only cases where people caught it again were extreme outliers.
0/0	There is no proof that ordering from your favorite restaurant tonight while watching your favorite show is an effective COVID vaccine but there is also no proof that it is NOT an effective vaccine. So I say let it rip, friends.
0/-1	There is no proof the vaccine will stop you from getting the virus or from spreading it. It just minimizes the symptoms.
1/-1	There is no reliable test to determine if somone has been vaccinated but , a serum anti-SARS CoV2 antibody test will be positive in the overwhelming majority of people who have been either vaccinated or who have been infected with the virus, but there is no way to distinguish between these.
1/1	There is no science here. Anti vaxxers are idiots. Plain and simple.
0/-1	There is no such thing as "no side effects" because for every cause, there must be an effect. This is known as the spiritual law of karma.
1/1	There is no such thing as safe. Taking the vaccine means accepting a risk. Not taking the vaccine means accepting a risk. Personally I feel the risk of not taking the vaccine is far higher than the risk of taking the vaccine so when it‚Äôs my turn I‚Äôll gladly take my vaccine, but I‚Äôm not waiting patiently. I‚Äôm constantly checking the news and occasionally (politely) checking with my local GP to find out how far down the list of priorities they are so that I can get an idea of when my turn will come.
0/0	There is no such thing as ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äù Covid cases anymore! When people who have already had Covid and have had three shots are still getting Covid, pretty sure we‚Äôre past that term. It was a breakthrough case when the shot was 95% affected. It isn‚Äôt anymore. Move past it.
0/0/0	There is no sufficient evidence on the safety of the vaccine because it hasn't been sufficiently tested. The vaccine can't be mandatory until enough data on mortality and permanent conditions induced by it will be available. They make us sign a paper that states that nobody is responsible for any adverse reaction that one might get after taking it, if it was safe this wouldn't be necessary. If I get severly compromised, who is going to pay?
1/1	There is no threat. We are not taking part in a trial or experimentation. The vaccines have been approved through use by experts, parts of the vaccine (non-specific to covid) have been in development and testing for years. You can refuse the vaccine. I suggest you read up.
0/0	There is no vaccine for COVID-19 as of right now no matter much they claim there is.
0/0	There is no vaccine for this virus. You will see nothing but blood after the vaccine! DO NOT TAKE IT!!
0	There is no virus..coronavirus is the common cold..the vaccine will change your DNA forever.
0/0	There is no way I'm taking this
0/0	There is no way Im getting these vaccines.
0/0/0/0/0	There is no way I‚Äôm taking a vaccine right away. I‚Äôm waiting at least a year to see what happens to y‚Äôall.
0/-1	There is no way im taking the shot.
0/-1	There is no way of knowing at this point how these vaccines will affect each person. It takes a long time to develop a vaccine. This warp speed vaccine was not tested long enough. They don't know the actual short, or long term side effects. Or, if it will potentially cause permanent damage, or death because there's no way of knowing at this time.
0/-1	There is no way of proving an individual will get less sick from COVID with a vaccination.
0/0	There is noooo pandemic only plandemic.
0/0	There is not nearly enough research for me to feel comfortable to get the vaccine. I‚Äôm only 13 and I don‚Äôt want to go blind, have fertility issues, get really sick, etc.
0/0	There is nothing god cant protect you from , a million vaccines cant even compare
1/1	There is nothing to worry about. Get the shots. You may feel slickly sick fro a day but almost everyone I know had no symptoms or really mild symptoms like chills or feeling tired. The only two with more sick-like symptoms both had covid previously and felt sick for a day.
1/1/1/1	There is nothing wrong with the J&J vaccine. You don't have to alter your DNA when you take that one and it provides the best long term immunity.
0/0	There is nothing you can say, or do to convince me to be injected with that poison.
1/1	There is overwhelming scientific evidence that the vaccines being offered in the United States (moderna, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson) are completely safe
1/1	There is overwhelming scientific evidence that vaccination is the best defence against serious infections.
1/1	There is overwhelming scientific support for the fact that vaccines work and that the benefits of the vaccine far outweighs the risk.
1/1	There is plenty of evidence of the effectiveness of the vaccine.
1/1	There is so much misinformation being spread about the disease and the vaccine, and you have made it very simple for people to understand. I hope this helps to dispel some of the fear people have of this vaccine.
1/1	There is some good news: The first doses of the #PfizerBioNTech vaccine arrived in California last night.
0/0	There is something in that shot that they want us all to have inside our bodies
1/0	There is such an absurd amount of misinformation in this content section. Just goes to show you that it's only "trust the scientists" when they back up your preconceived arguments.
1/-1	There is the right and duty of a citizen. It is important to take into account all perspectives. Someone gave me this sentence. Also sub question - what does the word freedom mean!
0/0/0/-1	There isn't any knowledge or data of the side affects because it hasn't been tested. She is contradicting herself.
1/0	There isn't any knowledge or data of the side affects because it hasn't been tested. Vaccination is fine.
0/-1	There isn't enough data or studies
0/1	There must be a vaccine for pre natal babies too
1/-1	There must be some ways to get the vaccines to the people much quicker. For example in the old days during the 1776 the guns were very slow and ineffective. They involved a lot steps before they can fire the shots. But later during the 1863 the new faster guns were invented called the Gatling guns. I was just wondering if we all can come up with the better ways to get people vaccinated faster and faster as we continue to find better faster ways like people did in the past.
1/-1	There needs to be hundreds of more videos like this to educate the extremely ignorant public
1/1	There needs to be hundreds of more videos like this to educate the extremely ignorant public.
0/-1	There needs to be open debate and disemination of information. The broken trust is what needs to be addressed.
1/1	There not telling us what it's made of wtf when i got vaccinated i got a whole ass information packet with the brand of the vaccine, the type of vaccine, a full list of the vaccine's ingredients, list of side effects, at home aftercare, and warnings for ppl at risk of bein hurt by the vaccine.
1/-1	There really shouldn't be many more hospitalisations or deaths, almost everyone who was vulnerable has been vaccinated. Over 95% of the over 70 population have received at least one dose of a vaccine, over 90% of the 50 to 70 age group and over 95% of care home residents. The current daily average for Covid deaths is in the low to mid thirties. If it goes up very much from that I will be very surprised and more than a bit disappointed. New infections will undoubtedly rise, but the theory is that what has been a very successful vaccination programme should have broken the link between the number of new infections and the number of hospitalisations and deaths. We shall see. This is the first proper test of a vaccination programme in a populous country, and a populous country with an estimated base of some quarter of a million plus Covid infected people in that population.
1/1	There should be a bigger HC Award, for not just regular people. Like, when an anti-vax celebrity goes down. Someone who has done maximum damage by spreading their anti-vax BS to a large audience. The radio guys would be good ones, Ben is another one. Sherri Tenpenny, Del Bigtree, RFK Jr., and Bob Sears, Not-Doctor-but-MISTER Andrew Wakefield‚Ä¶
1/1	There should be a country formed somewhere out in the ocean for all those who do not take the vaccine to protect those waiting to get it.
0/0	There should be world wide protest about what‚Äôs happening in Austria. It‚Äôs only a matter of time that we start locking down the unvaccinated. This is a major human rights violation.
1/1	There should've been mandatory vaccination from day 1, and we wouldn't be facing any form of containment measures at all anymore
0/0	There sure is a lot of "govern me harder daddy" going on in this section. Lucky they're not speaking out their mouths, it's choc full of government cock.
0/0/0	There was never a pandemic
0/0	There was never a pandemic only a seasonal flu famously renamed
0/0	There was never anything to vaccinate against
0/0	There were 350,000 cases a year of the flu in Australia up until 2020 when the flu disappered, there were on average 1,500 deaths a year in Australia from the flu up until 2020, there was on average over 4,000 people in hospital from the flu up until 2020, the flu and covid both have a 99.7 % survival rate for most, yet with the flu, no lockdowns, no forced vaccine mandates which by the way is against The Australian Constitutional Law section 51:23a, The Nuremberg Code, Human Rights etc...
1/1	There were genuinely more people at some of my high school cheerleading competitions than were gathered around the reflecting pool yesterday. These people are fringe weirdos, and don't deserve the ink you give them. This whole story could have been a sentence: "Small crowd of deranged extremists gather in nation's capital to vociferously reject science."
1/1	There were only 6 out of 6, 000, 000 so a 1 in a million chance
0/0	There were zero deaths from Covid. Fake virus. Fake vaccine.
0/0	There will NEVER be a cure..
0/0	There will NEVER be a cure...
1/-1	There will always be people who do not understand the realities of public health and do not feel a responsibility to their fellow-citizens to do things they don't like for the common good. This is an "educational moment" for us all.
1/1	There will always be someone who have a deadly reaction against the vaccine. No drug is ever 100 percent safe.
0/0	There will be an enormous cover up over these reactions to this dangerous vaccine
1/1	There will be no dumb people when the anti vaxxers die right?
0/0	There will never be a cure because they don't want to make a cure. They won't end the cash cow.
0/0	There would not be "Swarms of Anti Vaxxers" if it was "safe and effective" which it's obviously not. Good luck with perpetual boosters
0/0	There wouldnt be a need for mandates IF IT ACTUALLY WORKED... Isnt the entire world unvaccinated right now since we still Jab against the wuhan version? IT would explain a lot
1/1	There you have it! A fully authorized life saving vaccine! Use it for fuck‚Äôs sake!
1/1	There's 70 million adults are more scared of the scientist lab produced vaccine than a wild virus that probably mutated in a bat cave with nearly 600,000 deaths. At some point you need to pass them by and move on to people who aren't in neat categories and aren't scared of a vaccine.
1/0	There's a difference between strong immune system and healthy immune system. Strong will kill you healthy will not
0/0	There's a huge difference. I know many people who are unvax'd, got covid, and had less severe symptoms than those who were vax'd and got covid.
1/1	There's a lot of great news lately, despite the variants - all vaccines seem to protect against severe disease from all current variants. It seems like post-vaccination life will be very close to normal, and Covid will actually be like a mild flu then
0/0	There's a new deadly variant been discovered. Its called VACCINE
0/0	There's a reason why a thousands and thousands of doctors and nurses refuse to take that crap
1/-1	There's always been some controversy surrounding vaccines, but in the past that was usually overridden by fear of the disease itself. The point is that when people are terrified of a disease, they are far more willing to take risks
1/-1	There's an art to explaining complex issues (Vaccines) in an easy-to-understand manner.
1/-1	There's an art to explaining complex issues in an easy-to-understand manner.
0/0	There's billions of all types of viruses. When you go the route of creating artificial immunity via medical intervention as the only viable means, it will never end. You'll need billions of vaccines. Truth is that the immune system gets stronger by being around people and that is exactly what those in "control" want to prevent
0/0	There's certainly a search for a safe effective vaccine but worries that companies or governments might push through something that isn't ready or properly tested is certainly a fair one to have, especially once you consider that Reddit is a global website and not every country and culture has a good history with being able to trust their doctors.
0/0	There's going to be more viruses and lockdowns. People will continue to get vaccines for every virus that emerges. It's sickening!
0/0	There's many reasons NOT to take any vaccine ESPECIALLY this one
0/0	There's most likely something horrible in these shots if they're trying to compel everyone to take it.
0/1/1/0	There's never anything to worry about when it comes to this liquid. It is perfection. I always laugh when I see the headline "FDA begins trials to determine safety in people under 30" "under 20" "under 10" "under 5" "under 2" "newborns" "pregnant women" "women who WANT to get pregnant" "men's reproductive abilities" "people with heart issues" --- the answer is always SAFE SAFE SAFE SAFE APPROVED APPROVED APPROVED
1/1/1/-1	There's no "Pro-vaccine" There's just "Anti-vaccine" and normal people
0/0	There's no conspiracy theory here. Distrust is very very real.
0/0	There's no cure for that vaccine. Once you get it may God bless you
0/0	There's no enough data to prove that 4th booster is actually needed.
1/0	There's no evidence the COVID-19 vaccine is unsafe if you're pregnant.
0/0	There's no long term tests.. YOU taking the shots are the TEST.
0/0	There's no pandemic
0/0	There's no social responsibility/liability for vaccines harms so I'd suggest those enforcing the vaccines are selfish.
0/0	There's no such thing as a coincidence. Keep my vaccines.
0/-1	There's no such thing as coronavirus, prove me wrong. I can prove my side
0/0	There's no way I take the coronavirus vaccine as things are. I'm not anti vac at all, I've had everything. The testing on this vaccine is next to non existent and several people have became extremely ill from them at testing.
1/1	There's no way people can be this dumb. They really think the vaccine isn't safe? I've just been reading some of the comments... it's bewildering
0/0	There's no way to prove it doesn't affect fertility. The data is not available yet. Not going to risk my children's future fertility for a cold/flu virus with over a 99% survival rate.
0/0	There's nobody they wouldn't tell it was safe to take vaccine. My trust in the media is far gone. There is no level they will not stoop to
0/-1	There's reason why no one is spreading polio/small pox you fucking retard, yet Covid is tearing through everyone including the vaccinated.
1/0	There's side effect if you don't get it you won't be around
1/1	There's so many of us here in the Philippines who want to be vaccinated but the vaccine supply is very limited. Please produce more vaccines & provide them to poor countries like ours.
1	There's so many scaredy cat people who don't want to get the vaccine. It's a piece of cake. Plus you won't be a spreader and get sick. Man up and do it
0/0	There's surely a conspiracy behind but....I'll never find out.
0/0	There's the all seeing eye. Medicines agency. Regular booster shots will be fatal.
1/1	There's undue attention being paid to the effectiveness of each vaccine candidate. Seasonal flu vaccines are often less than 50% effective and are still considered a worthy use of NHS funds. Fact: any level of effectiveness will help to reduce the R number. Got that? Now, let's stop fussing about a few percentage points, and the horrible prospect of idiots demanding different types of vaccines.
1	There's yet to be any scientifically sound evidence to prove otherwise (that vaccines aren't safe and effective)
0/0	Theres a 98.5% chance of surviving covid and a 100% chance i wont get your bs shot.
0/0	Theres a lot of excitement around the new record vaccines???? Is there really? Maybe for the stupidly brainwashed
1/1	Theres a research paper out today and there's an article about it in the Telegraph it seems the Oxford vaccine is very effective.
0/0	Theres more side affects covid shot than marijuana..
0/0/0	Theres too much false information i don't trust the vaccine i'm waiting
0/0	There‚Äôs a difference between being against a Gene editing rna ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù and being against taking regular vaccines that have been around for a long time
0/0	There‚Äôs a lot bots commenting on this video how they got the Moderna vaccine and the Pfizer vaccine.Don‚Äôt fall for the trap!
1/1	There‚Äôs a lot of vaccine preference conversations happening right now. Can we take a step back and just appreciate a >90% effective vaccine from multiple producers that have had only a handful of complications out of tens of millions? All of this was implemented in less than a year to wrangle a virus that is/was dominating the world. It‚Äôs an incredible light at the end of the tunnel and I‚Äôm so grateful that everyone in my family and I were able to get jabbed.
0/0	There‚Äôs a plethora of bad side effects caused by this vaccine that are worse than the virus it was created to protect people from.
0/0	There‚Äôs almost no benefit in getting the vaccine if you are under 50 because the odds of dying from COVID-19 are around 0.03% ‚Äî about the same odds of being struck by lightening
1/1	There‚Äôs enough very fit people that have been made very very ill from Covid. Being super fit doesn‚Äôt let you off the hook - cytokine storm is very nasty
1/1	There‚Äôs no causal evidence for any bad side effects. This vaccine is safer than any other in history as it does not involve injecting any virus into the body.
0/0	There‚Äôs no guarantee that the vaccines are safe. There has not been enough time to evaluate long-term effects. There may not be any problems long-term, but it‚Äôs impossible to know that yet.
0/0	There‚Äôs no reason for me to get the vaccine
0/0/0/0/0	There‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm taking this shit
1/1	There‚Äôs no win win only loose loose till we can get enough vaccine into arms
1/0	There‚Äôs not enough vaccines right now, if there projection of when there will be- it‚Äôs to late.
1/1	There‚Äôs so much wrong with your view. Firstly, a virus is contagious believe it or not. Secondly, vaccines protect others as it weakens the virus when it infects you and spreads onto others.
0/0	There‚Äôs something bigger going on people. Something much bigger in play, and for those who have been fully vaccinated, you‚Äôll find out soon enough‚Ä¶
0/0	There‚Äôs something fishy going on it seems, so many of these posts coming up recently.
0/0	There‚Äôs therapeutics that CAN HELP WHY are they so against these meds? Could the big PUSH OF VACCINES be for $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ and or population control???
0	These #Covid_19 vaccines are a huge failure for industrial research Covid-19: 52% of the world's population vaccinated. The death curve has the same slope. Polio: eradicated with 88% of the world's population vaccinated. At 52% coverage, the decline was very clear.
0/-1	These 2 don't even know they re being used
0/0	These Doctors won‚Äôt even take it!!!
0/0/0/0	These Doctors won‚Äôt even take it!!! They just going to wait it out until the people that got vaccinated lost their mind
1/1	These anti vac people are honestly the most selfish part of humanity
1/1	These anti vaxxers people are living in an ‚Äúallegory of the cave‚Äù type of life.
1/1	These anti-vaxxers are the same as mentally insane murderers - they are responsible for the deaths of others due to their strange beliefs. Murderers are usually victims of abuse. Should we feel bad when they die?
1/1	These antivaxxers could be guilty of culpable homicide. Governments should pass emergency legislation to prevent these radicals from having a platform to spread their dangerous views
0/-1	These are 6 cases in over 6 million J&J vaccines administered, so a much lower frequency.
1/1	These are all coincidences. Vaccines don't cause death I think you're getting mixed up, it's anti Vax people that cause death. If someone can't get the vax for some reason, and then 6 other ppl in their class CHOOSE not too then it's not only putting your child at risk, it's also putting all the children who physically CAN'T have the vax in danger. You put your siblings, friends and everyone who can't have it done in danger. It keeps getting passed on and turns into an epidemic.
0/0	These are gene modification tools, nothing to do whatsoever with keeping the population safe.
0/0	These are leaky vaccines and at best may reduce the threat of hospitalization, but at what cost? As we continue to see more information come in from countries across the world of which are some of the most vaccinated populations globally, and are now seeing an immense amount of break through cases, shouldn‚Äôt we proceed with far greater caution ?
0/-1	These are not journalists. They are ACTORS.
0/-1	These are the endocrine disrupters in your child's Vaccines. But hey! Don't believe me! Do the research below!
0/0	These aren‚Äôt vaccines they are mRNA treatments and other vaccines were fda approved

0/0	These comments give me hope.. \nLove all of you! Stay safe! \nR.E.S.I.S.T!!!
1/1	These comments give me no hope for humanity. You don‚Äôt believe the experts, you don‚Äôt believe the people actually IN THE HOSPITALS TAKING CARE OF ALL THESE UNVACCINATED PEOPLE, the ones who see it for themselves‚Ä¶ the confirmation bias everyone has is absolutely overwhelming. Common sense and the ability to look beyond ourselves and only what directly affects us is completely gone.
0/0	These companies aren‚Äôt liable if your injured in the process. Stop and think about that!
0/0	These companies have no interest in your health. There is no money in well people....
0/0	These covid 19 vaccines are the way to control your mind
0/0	These covid vaccines are funded by Bill Gates, he has admitted to his desire to depopulize the earth, thru vaccines, abortion ect. He believes the world is overpopulated, its a lie, the earth can sustain a whole lot more humans, its only big cities like NY, Tokyo, LA. The world has space, its not over populated. I don't trust a vaccine, but I trust my immune system and taking care of my health, and have vitamins, I trust in God. This is a Plandemic, not a pandemic. The news is propaganda to instill fear into you.
0/0	These days, the data I trust is what I see in my personal life. I personally know 23 people who have tested positive in the last 3 weeks, 11 triple vaccinated, 7 unvaccinated, 5 doubled vaccinated.
0/-1	These doctors are eugenicists. Psycopaths.
0/0	These doctors are the opposite of selfish. They are demonstrating courage, integrity and discernment that has been notably absent from regulators and media. I applaud them and support them 100%. The decision to end the mandate is a victory for the public and for the nation.
0/1	These doctors should be applauded for standing up for the people!!!! The title should be "doctors for early treatment ".
1/1	These geniuses saved my life. I cannot say thank you enough. Thank you, science!!!
0	These guys were strong and manly before they had their experimental mRNA shots.
0/0	These include the claim that the genetic material in the vaccine will find its way into your DNA permanently.
0/0	These jabs are not needed not safe not ethical, prove otherwise and kindly stop referring too PCR results as infections, cases or a clinical diagnosis
1/1	These magats on twitter are saying they‚Äôll never sleep with someone who gets the vaccine and I‚Äôm just over here being incredibly thankful for the amazing surprise side effect!
1/0	These may cure cancer. I am grateful to all the people who are taking this experimental drug. Your helping the future. Awesome üëç
0/0	These mrna vaccines are more useless as ice cubes in drinks in the north pole‚Ä¶
1/1	These new types of medicines, they are the future. mRNA / siRNA / DNA medicines will help us one day develop medicines to kill cancer cells safely and kill bacteria that is resistant to antibiotics. The COVID19 virus was a blessing in disguise in that it triggered governments to get off their butts and remove a bunch of red tape and bs out of the way. It allowed researchers around the world to go into hyper drive essentially and develop this as quickly and safely as possible

We will probably save several years of research time on these types of medicines after all is said and done. I honestly think that ethics boards should go fly a kite. If someone wants to volunteer their life to the betterment of society and is of sound mind, then let them. It's our bodies. Tired of people constantly feeling like they get to dictate how everyone else should live because they "feel" a certain way.
1/1	These new vaccines are the stepping stones to some great advances in medicine coming our way. This is an exciting time in biotechnology.
0/0	These nurses are heros. A lot of anti vaccers can now get vacs cards.
0/0	These of course represent about 1% of side affects, according to the CDC, so imagine what real data would look like. Also, we are seeing only short term affects, what might the long term affects be? I say, screw these biologics, we have Ivermectin.
0/0	These people are eerily too excited about this. My family and I will pass.
1/1	These people are freaking out over a 1 in 1000000000 chance of getting a bad reaction to a vaccine but completely overlook the harmful effects of their lifestyle
1/1	These people are just just bringing up one in maybe a million case and saying that we shouldn‚Äôt get vaccinated for that!
1/1	These people have too much time on their hands. These people seem like they aren‚Äôt even educated in health or science. Just basing their judgement on emotions or what they believe, not what‚Äôs been proven.

1/1	These scientists should receive a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their tireless work. So impressive and selfless!! Ain't "magic"...SCIENCE RULES!!!!!!!
0/0/1/1/-1	These scientists who developed the vaccine are speedrunners
0/0	These shots are Trojan horses it basically contains the glyco protein 120 from the original hiv fragment.
1/1	These shots should already be going into people's arms.
0/0	These side effects are a lot more common than advertised. I know several people in my personal circle suffering from heart conditions, blood conditions and even deteriorating eye sight. I‚Äôm not sure who is suffering from genuine side effects and who is just getting old, but some of them won‚Äôt even consider looking into their conditions being an injury whilst the other half is furious.
1/-1	These side effects are known and are a sign that your immune system is working.
1/0	These side effects may affect your child‚Äôs ability to do daily activities, but they should go away in a few days.
0/0	These two guys are idiots or obviously paid by big pharma or are too scared to say the truth in case they get censored and banned. Anyway there is the answer about the vaccines safety. NOT SAFE VERY DANGEROUS!!!!!!!!!!
0/0	These two men, I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t believe not one word they tell us. These two men are way to scripted, way to excited and way to happy about the vaccines.
0/0	These vaccinations need to be stopped right now.
0/0	These vaccine companies have ZERO liability for damage caused by their PRODUCTS. Let that sink in.
0/0	These vaccine will damage your natural immunity in the long run just use your common sense
0/0	These vaccine's usually have bad reactions even when done patiently. This is rushed and I'm not a guinea pig.

0/1	These vaccines are experimental & should only be taken after consulting with your personal physician. Promoting the vaccine to the healthy 16+ population is irresponsible, at best! GET A 2ND PROFESSIONAL OPINION!
0/0	These vaccines are going to damage your RNA, turn your body in a GMO and may result in eventual organ failure!!
0/0	These vaccines are going to do so much damage to individuals and cause many deaths people need to do research in to what is really going on here.BIG PICTURE
0/0	These vaccines are in a testing phase, we are the subjects. This was "operation warp speed" -- So they rushed the vaccine years in advance, did no long-term testing as is standard with vaccines. We are test subjects, that's literally what is happening.
1/0	These vaccines are just for business and supremacy, stop playing with people's life!
0/0	These vaccines are not proven to be ‚Äòsafe and effective‚Äô. There is no way of knowing long-term side effects, though having looked into it, I would think these would include some sort of immunodeficiency disorder as well as infertility. Not surprising, since the main orchestrators wish to drastically reduce the world‚Äôs population.
0/0	These vaccines are not safe !!! To develop a safe vaccine, it takes many years .... not a year. Another thing is even Those companies like Pfizer not taking any responsibility for any side effects as they even can‚Äôt say what they are especially long-term side effects !!! In Europe is already many deaths and side effects after that of course it‚Äôs not after the vaccine they reckon !!!!! Stop this propaganda
1/0	These vaccines are not safe for anyone young or old.

0/1	These vaccines are way to rushed to be safe
0/-1	These vaccines certainly do make you wonder..
0/0	These vaccines do not have an excellent track record. They are new so there is no data. Further they are a type of vaccine that has never been used before
0/0	These vaccines have already proven to be ineffective! They are used to introduce digital passports and digital wallets! Globalists and oligarchs want total public control!
0/0	These vaccines have always been about making money.
0/0	These vaccines have been out less than a year. We still have NO fucking clue on the long-term effects. How's that for misinformation?
1/0	These vaccines have been rushed to the public too quickly
0/0	These vaccines have never been tested long enough to determine if they'll cause ADE or not
0/1	These vaccines have never stopped or or significantly reduced transmission, as they never intended to be. Even if it was the case covid is just like regular cold or flu, no big deal.
0/0	These vaccines kill.
0/0	These vaccines may be modifying the genetic make up of the virus into new strains , instead of creating an actual immunity
0/0	These vaccines protect you about as much as a tennis racket used as an umbrella.
0/0	These vaccines should NEVER be mandatory. I am afraid of this vaccine.
0/0	These vaccines were rushed.
0/0	These vaccines will do far more harm than good.
0/0	These vaccines will sterilize the person who receives it. That means you can't have any children. This is how the New World Order will meet the United Nations 2030 agenda to reduce the population. If this is what you want...then get the so called vaccine.
0/-1	These videos on the various vaccines aren't critical enough. And the conclusions are based on studies in the short term small sample sizes.
1/1	These were my exact side effects after second dose of Moderna! Mine didn‚Äôt really kick in as fast as yours, but took 24 hours of aches and pains to feel normal again. You‚Äôre absolutely right about enduring these effects any day over COVID. Definitely worth it and hopefully people aren‚Äôt scared off by a day of pain to avoid a potentially life altering (or ending) disease.
0/0	Theses nurses have been saying there has been a lot of cases in the hospital of still born babies and some of them believe it to have relation to these mothers getting the vaccine.
0	They DO NOT WORK! PFIZER does NOT work. period
0/0	They Have NOT CURED The COMMON COLD VIRUS, NOR CURED The AIDS VIRUS, Why Should We Be DECEIVED TO Believe They Can Cure The COVID-19 Virus???
0/0	They all work the same, an ambulance comes for you in the end
1/1	They already took it, so did healthcare workers.
0/0	They also cause bloods clots, permanent disability and death.
0/0	They always point to the one in a million case to prove the case for the vaccine ( I.e. 30 year olds), how about the cases of people who died shortly after getting the vaccine you never hear about those as a reason not to get it.
1/-1	They always talk about debates but refuses to read medical studies‚Ä¶.
1/1	They are RIGHT! Healthcare workers over the WHOLE WORLD should have top priority.
0/0	They are all under trial for 2 years yet so I‚Äôll wait thanks. They have absolutely no clue how the vaccines work with so many conditions and other medications. They still don‚Äôt even have enough data to declare they are 100% safe re human fertility! Covid is no threat to most
1/1	They are all very effective, so timing becomes the way to measure what is best. Sooner = better.
1/-1	They are and they have been for some time. A coronavirus vaccine will be part of the annual ‚Äòflu jab‚Äô from now on.
0/0/0	They are basically seeing who is stupid enough to take it, those are the ones that can be controlled.
1/1	They are clearly trying to skew data to emphasize their points. If the US has rolled out more vaccines than any other country than what does percent vaccinated to population matter?! Israel‚Äôs population is 1/36th our population, of course they‚Äôd have a higher percent vaccinated. Why have more white Americans received the vaccine? Because the first wave was directed towards healthcare workers, teachers, and law enforcement. The majority of people in those career fields are white, which explains why they would have higher vaccination numbers at this point in time. This is propaganda, plain and simple
0/-1	They are concern.only with their profit!!
0/0	They are covering up side effects
0/0	They are damaging and killing the Children. Is this not your line In the sand? If not what Is??? #VaccineSideEffects #VaccinesWork #vaccineinjuries #vaccineinjured #myocarditis #VaccineDeaths #VaccineDeath #Genocide

0/0	They are effective at messing up your genetics and health permanently.
1/1	They are effective.
0/0	They are experimental vaccines, and people don‚Äôt want to be guinea pigs to companies with a poor record of integrity.
0/0	They are forcing people to get this vaccination, whether directly or indirectly by not allowing intl travel without the vaccine is still force. Can you say mark of the beast?!
0/0/0	They are funding their own studies...all bs.
0/0	They are going to enforce vaccines the same way the made masks mandatory, thats why we as the people should LEAVE AMERICA, start our own society with our own laws. They are experimenting on us like we‚Äôre their lab rats.. and all for what in exchange? Continuous grunt work to pay off this unpayable debt the U.S government put us in? All on top of that more debt like college and taxes being created and placed to be payed first before that 50 trillion dollar debt, therefore making this debt damn near impossible to pay off. this is all a political game these psychopaths in power play and have been playing for over 200 years, it‚Äôs time we actually wake up and we do something because peaceful protests don‚Äôt work.
0/0	They are going to have separate states for vaccinated and non-vaccinated. I will be in non-vaccinated state.
0/-1	They are heroes for forging vax cards. I support their actions.
1/1	They are ignorant and selfish if they don't get the shot.
1/1	They are incredibly safe, so there's on absolute safety in anything in life.
0/0	They are just baffled we caught on to the fact that the vaccines don't work, and in fact do more damage than we ever dreamed of.
0/0	They are literally gonna kill off half the population and shrug it off with this corona virus vaccine
1/0	They are lying ...and after. Trump and dr fauci i dont trust them none of these fools
0/0	They are lying us
0	They are making a new formula directed at Omicron because *news flash* they already knew the shots weren't effective against omicron, - whether it's your first shot .... or your 4th.
0/1	They are making up something special for us...all the darker people. It's their plan to give it to us first.... the vaccine.
0/0	They are making us to think its fool proof or a " Magic Potion" . and its NOT
0/0/0/0/0	They are not FDA approved!!! Not getting anything that is not FDA APPROVED!!!
0	They are not a vaccines, they are experimental gene therapy.
0/-1	They are not anti vaxxers..They are strong free willed people with immune systems. Love to them all Ô∏è Sydney Australia
0/-1	They are not responsible if something goes wrong with this experiment. Hell no. Give it to the elites. Don't hire someone and with technology make it appear as if they're taking it. No lawsuit no monkey suit
0/0	They are not safe and my friends wife is proof. After her second shot. Her kidneys were shutting down. She had a bad reaction to the shot and was in the icu because of it. Be careful people. Main stream media isn't telling the whole story.
0/0	They are not safe for anyone. These are experimental mRNA vaccines that have already killed or maimed large numbers of people around the world. If you take these vaccines, you are serving as a laboratory rat for pharmaceutical companies that are making $$$Billions and face absolutely no liability for adverse reactions, including death.Furthermore, these vaccines are not necessary, since there are old (off-patent and therefore cheap), safe and effective medications like Hydroxychloroquine+zinc+azithromycin or Ivermectin.Do your research before you get these dangerous experimental vaccines, which, among other things, may cause infertility.
0/0	They are not safe for everyone and they do not provide any protection against the virus. This thing is a waste of time. Eat right, exercise, wash your hands, stay hydrated.
0/0	They are not telling us the truth (vaccines are not secure, probably on purpose) and people are just lining up for this....
0/-1	They are not the only ones profiting from this pandemic I met a lab worker who bought 5 covid testing vans in only one year.
0/0	They are only called boosters because they BOOST big pharma profit
0/0	They are only in for it for the money

0/0	They are safe for everyone that received them‚Äù is experimental ... you still testing them in humans... you are waiting now for data... you have no clue of reactions until it happens and is reported‚Ä¶
0/0	They are safe for no one.
1/0	They are self righteous morons !! Who have never seen a child suffer from measles induced encephalitis!!! !!! Xx
0/0	They are starting to have articles published to prepare people for the sickness the vaccine will cause to most people. I have no intention of getting a vaccine that hasn't had years of studies.
0/-1	They are still lying if they say it's due to high vaccinations.
0/0	They are synthetic EXPERIMENTAL INJECTIONS. Wake the hell up people.
0/-1	They are trying blame brith control and not the vaccine. Brith control has always come with a risk of blood clots. But the problems with J&J are different in scoop. It‚Äôs not the brith control. They know this but wait you to look else where.
0/0	They are trying to kill us, don't take the vaccine!
0/0	They are trying to take your freedom
0/0	They are tryna kill us wit the vaccine
0/0	They are using "anti-Vaxxer" as a tool to divide humanity. Those who do not have the ability to think will slander those who have worked it out. Why is the Guardian protecting Big Pharma "serial-Killers"? How much have they been paid to attack those who are not prepared to be slaughtered over something that has not been proven? The Guardian has not provided evidence that sar.s co.vid 2 exists.
0/0	They are using human for experiment instead of rabit.
1/1	They are usually safer than the disease statistically. The risk/reward is in favor of getting vaccinated. There are some that can have severe adverse effects.
0/0	They are volunteering for vaccines for getting off loans... We know where we failed
1/1	They aren't a danger to me. They are a danger to my kids, who cannot get vaccinated yet.
0/0	They aren't safe yet for anyone. Criminally negligent at best you lot.
0/0/0/0/0/0	They aren't telling you about all the deaths caused by this vacs
0/0	They ate also using nursing home residents for medication and vaccine trials. My mother was one of those elderly people with dementia that did not understand what was going on. The POA allowed it. :(
0/0	They came out with 4 types of vaccines like they dropped a new clothing line or something. Lol
1/1	They can cut your risk profoundly from severe disease, hospitalization, and death.
0/0	They can find a cure for covid within a year but can‚Äôt find a cure for cancer(s) .. I think I‚Äôll pass.
0/0	They can go to hell with their vaccine and I will NEVER EVER take it.
0/0/0/0	They can go to hell with their wicked vaccines.
0/0/0	They can have mine, I won‚Äôt take that.

0	They can keep that poison
0/0	They can keep their manmade concoctions... I‚Äôd rather stick to my God-given immune system.
0/0	They can keep their vaccine
0/0	They can never make it mandatory it‚Äôs against your human rights. It‚Äôs just a case of holding your nerve. Bravo to those with the balls to say no
0/0	They can now see into the future and know the long term effects. Amazing!
0/0	They can only demand it if it's safe and effective AND ITS NOT
0/0	They can program that mRNA vaccine to do all kind of shit in our bodies beside killing the covid virus.
1/1	They can protect us from illness.
0/0/0	They can stick the vaccine up their fucking arse... I AIN'T FUCKING HAVING IT MATE!
0/0	They can stick their experimental vaccines in their own arms.
0/0	They can stick their needle where the sun doesn‚Äôt shine. I am not taking the VACCINE

0/0/0/0/0/0/0	They can take that vaccine n put it up their?? I refuse, I will not take it..
0/0	They can try to tell me that the didn't cut any corners making these vaccines all that they want. I didn't belive them and here we are.
1/1	They can't blame vaccines on their kid's autism. It's a genetic disorder. A vaccine is literally a weakened form of the virus suspended in liquid to create memory cells in your immune system. The sickness in your kid is the body's natural response. If you could please your last two brain cells, and see actual Doctor, and maybe educate yourselves. Because now we got measles coming back, and I guarantee you guys aren't helping AT ALL
0/0	They cannot force you to have anything because that is against your human rights, they can highly advise you to have it or try & black mail you into having it but they cannot force it upon you
0/0	They can‚Äôt make a cure to AIDS or herpes ext. yet they create a COVID vaccine less then a year!! Yea Righhhtt.
0/0	They can‚Äôt possibly know the long term side effects are there hasn‚Äôt been enough time or study on the vaccine or the possible reactions to other meds or diseases .
0/0	They care so much that they are willing to kill us all in order to save our lives! :p
1/1	They caught it before the vaccine took effect. You need the booster shot 3 weeks later before it works. You can‚Äôt catch corona virus from the vaccine. Vaccine only has mRNA, not the virus.
0/0	They chose to interview a woman who doesn‚Äôt know what to even answer, to make antivaxer look ignorant. Try and talk to someone who can actually give you not only a correct answer but past and current evidences.
1/1	They complain about wearing masks, their rights are being taken away, however they will not do the right thing to get back to normalcy! Hopefully the majority of us do the right thing and get the vaccine! We have to in order to get back to normalcy!
1/1	They could create ads informing people to get vaccinated.
0/0	They could if they wanted to, they have a license to kill with this vaccine.
1/1	They could inject me with dog piss right now if it would protect me from Covid. I have a feeling I‚Äôm going to be vaccinated very soon and I won‚Äôt care what brand is in the syringe. I just want the #vaccine. I don‚Äôt have any concerns about clots or vaccine brands
0/0	They couldn‚Äôt kill us with the GMO food so now they‚Äôre going to try this !
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	They couldn‚Äôt pay me to take this poison.
0/0	They created the virus, gave it time to enter the human psyche and arouse fear, they created the demand, and now they provide the supply of the vaccine everyone wants and will pay trillions.
1/1	They develop a new flu vaccine yearly. This isn't developing a vaccine from the ground up, we know how to do it now. It's like saying you wouldn't fly on a new jet because it took the Write brothers 6 years to figure out flight.
1/1	They did the president now took it hes ok so did obama
0/0	They didn‚Äôt get a vaccine for a virus , they got a sterilization shot
1/1	They do not want to be vaccinated, but on the other hand they accept to be treated
1/1	They do work it is igh time parents and also the community embraces the importance of ensuring their children are vaccinated so as to prevent them from future unnecessary illnesses
0/1	They don't chase these ppl down to give them food or water. Only vaccines.
1/1	They don't vaccinate to make you sick they vaccinate to keep you from getting sick
0/0	They don't want it, because it doesn't prevent infection, and it doesn't prevent spread. It also doesn't last if it ever works at all. The risks outweigh the benefit.
0/0	They don't work. Merck (one of the vaccine manufacturers) has said it's better to get the virus and recover from it than to take the vaccine.
0/0	They don‚Äôt know the affect of it down the line. Not for me.
0/0	They don‚Äôt like how populated we are. They want to force vaccines so our unborn children won‚Äôt have functioning reproductive organs.
0/0	They don‚Äôt need vaccines. They need healthy immune systems.
0/0	They don‚Äôt protect you. They kill you. End of discussion.
1/1	They don‚Äôt talk about the huge distribution problem of mRNA vaccine. That vaccine needs -70C freezer for storage. On the other hand, astrazeneca only needs 4C and is way more cheeper to produce.
0/0	They don‚Äôt work. That‚Äôs why you need 20 booster shots. It‚Äôs just about money and power now. Let‚Äôs go Brandon! FJB!!!
0/0	They don‚Äôt work... I don‚Äôt believe in any vaccine
0/0	They even say on the FDA fact sheet for the Moderna vaccine that they don‚Äôt know the duration of the protection. How can you even evaluate whether it‚Äôs worth it if you don‚Äôt know how long it will be useful for? If you just read the information they are publishing about these vaccines as a rational person, it is hard to understand the justification for taking them.
0/0	They expect us to trust them and follow like lost sheep. Not happening! Not getting vaccinated!
1/-1	They forgot about the broken healthcare system that‚Äôs in worse shape now.
0/0	They forgot the 30% of healthcare workers, the first responders...and how many tens of thousands in all branches of the military. We won‚Äôt be bullied or forced into believing a rushed injection is somehow better then the immune system the Good Lord gave us.
0/1/0	They forgot to tell you that the reasons why vaccines were developed during long period of time it was because they needed to be sure about the probability of side effects that can be only evaluated after some considerable time passing.
0/1	They go for this vaccine because they think its safe and because they're made to think that they need it! I know ppl that want it even after i explain what's in it and the side effects! I've been called selfish because i wont have it and I'm putting others at risk!
1/1	They got infected from someone not the vaccine. The first vaccine only introduces the virus to the body and allows the body to fight it off. That‚Äôs when the body attacks the virus. 21 days after, you get the second vaccine and that will decrease the chance of contracting the virus by 95%.
0/0/0	They got the vaccine huh? Man that sucks for them
0/0	They have NO IDEA of the long term side effects of these mRNA vaccines as they freely admit.
0/0	They have been trying for years to get a decent vaccine for flu and the common cold, nothing works so far. Why a vaccine for an illness that can be prevented by a decent level of vitamin D and zinc.
0/0/0/0	They have been working on coronavirus vaccines for years. They have never been successful. Suddenly successful?
0/0/0/0/0	They have blood clots in their brain?! It‚Äôs a NO for me.
0/-1	They have compromised themselves when they hid the truth of this pandemic from us.
0/-1	They have doubts as to whether the vaccines are actually safe, given the rapid pace of development, and whether possible side effects have been adequately studied.
1/1	They have gone through ALL of the safety testing and analyses as any other drug or vaccine brought to market previously.
1/1	They have literally been proven safe. MRNA vaccines have been tested on humans for decades and its astonishing to me that so many normal, un-qualified people with no education in virology or vaccine science act like they know more than actual scientists who get paid to study this stuff.
0/0	They have nano bots in them
0/0	They have no idea what the long term effects are. I choose to increase my immune system naturally
0/0	They have not followed the same testing guidelines as a FDA approved vaccine. As a matter a fact animal studies were skipped in many of these ‚Äútrials‚Äù.
0/0	They have not had enough time for trials. Count me out
1/1	They have tested the vaccine, and yes some people who have been vaccinated do get Covid but it‚Äôs usually not as bad as for people unvaccinated, unless they have a preexisting condition
0/0	They have to catch me first !!
0/0/0/0	They haven't been tested on animals human beings are the Guinea pigs. This is all lies no one trust who anymore.
0/0	They inject you future mutations..let us see where that leads to the ones that took it
0/0	They is some hidden agenda on this demonic virus, why explain the way they make these vaccines, it's about time we run to Jesus and repent our si a brothers and sisters
0/0	They just DONT know how safe and effective it is long term. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs most concerning to me. Long. Term. Effects.
0/-1	They just getting flu shots
0/0	They just had a person died this week from that vaccines. It was just on the news this week
0/0	They just want to kill kids with this vaccine they don't know what it does for these kids in the long term and it's money too
0/0	They just want to pretend good reason to include kids for the injections; which we‚Äôve all predicted they would do once they realized a huge percent of adults didn‚Äôt want the injections and that they would lose billions over it. They‚Äôre trying to stretch these as far as they can.
0/-1	They just want to put chips in you
0/0	They keep saying every person in America ummmmm not me bc I just don‚Äôt know how I feel about it I don‚Äôt even like getting the flu shot
0/0	They keep you from getting Covid then why the mask and distance after. Ill help you. You really have no fking idea if it does or not. Rolling the dice. With our lives.
0/0	They lie about this that it's safe .Not FDA approved. No way in hell will I have this
0/0	They like to make us think we dont have a choice. We do.
0/-1	They like to tell us the reason for something is one thing when it really exists for a totally different reason. Like they say abortion gives women a choice but it‚Äôs really depopulation
0/0	They love the "Anti Vaxxer" tag. If someone doesn't want to take vaccines based on knowledge they have required then what's the problem? Surely it's about being pro safe, and the fact is this vaccine has not been proven to be safe. I've had many vaccines but I will not be having this one.
0/0	They lying dont take it
0/0	They made it to fast im no goofy i new this would happen take that vaccines turn it side ways and stick it up you candy the rock finish it off for me
0/0	They made this chaos to give them something to save us from
0/-1	They make it seem like everybody wants it. By the looks of the 10k plus comments in every video I've seen nobody wants it. Goverment will save alot of money
0/0	They managed to survive Covid, but not the vaccine. R.I.P.
0/0	They market this stuff in a sneaky way to make you want it. I can‚Äôt be tho only person that can see through this trickery??
0/0	They might as well just line people up and literally pull the trigger. This is flat out murder without the bullets but yet instead in a liquid form.
1/0	They need to develope trust and explain how it works to get people to take it.... No. NO MEANS NO, no further words needed
1/0	They need to make it mandatory to get a vaccine
0/0	They need to pass a bill stating tht if the vaccine hurt you in any way your family should be able to sueüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØ
0/-1	They need to ship out money before they ship out a vaccine
0/0	They need to stop using all of them, until they have been completely & totally approved in accordance to the approved requirements for all previous drugs.
1/0	They need to widely promote and show the results of all tests and studies of the vaccine. Like spend hours on tv and social media showing it. If it‚Äôs positive people may change their minds
0	They never had a vaccine for any other corona virus. Dont seem them succeeding now. Even if their is one, Ill pass. And Ill pass on the flu shot, like I do every year.
0/0	They never isolated the alleged first strain. Why should we believe there is a new strain? Viruses don't exist. The "vaccine" is a bioweapon in disguise. Wake up!
0/0	They new all along this was nothing more than to shock and shame people in to getting the jab
0/0	They offered it to me when I was pregnant with my son last spring of 2021. Absolutly NOT! Dumb founded they would even suggest it. Made me loose trust in my midwife and provider.
0/0	They only make the vaccines for money, they don't even work
1/1	They provide high level of protection against severe illness and death, lower protection against infection
1/1	They r freaking out for no reason whatsoever. Birth control has 1 in 1000 chance to develop clots whereas the vaccine 1 in 1000000. Yet we use birth control. THE RISKS OUTWEIGH THE BENEFITS!
1/0	They re worried that an experimental treatment that skipped animal trials, was produced under Emergency exemptions to normal FDA safety tests, who s producers are all immune from lawsuits related to adverse affects as a result of taking the vaccine is being shoved down our throats by all the institutions who ve proven themselves through their deceitful conduct since the advent of COVID to not be trustworthy.
0/0	They really think they‚Äôre businesses are more important than peoples lives??? Boycott all businesses requiring mandatory vax and they will see you has the power
0/0	They really want to get rid of people don't they.
1/-1	They recently announced that they're looking at using the same technology to treat MS with a vaccine. What a time to be alive.
0/0	They say it out weighs the risks but I'm not willing to take those risks. Until those side effects are taking care of I'm not going to even consider taking the vaccine. I'm used to vaccines making you sick at most not killing you at worst.
1/1/1	They say that the definition of luck is when preparation meets opportunity. By that definition, we certainly were "lucky". Kudos to generations of scientists! And this video is magnificently written.
0/0/0/0	They say the benefits outweigh the risks.....yeah, tell that to the 19 people who survived a whole year of the covid outbreak but died from getting the vaccine
0/0	They say the corona virus will kill you if you are old and have underlying conditions. That you are to stay inside and wear a mask when you do go out. Then they develop a vaccine in record time which basically gives you the corona virus to stimulate anti bodies. In conclusion they are killing you with a vaccine.
0/1	They say there is no science to back that it may cause infertility. What they don‚Äôt tell you is there is no science to back it up that it won‚Äôt cause infertility since they skipped/rush the development and production.
0/0	They say vaccine is 5G things üç≠
0/1	They seem like they're not really into anything what science say mostly leave in all the rumors from the web on vaccines and their are teens standing up against their own parents that are anti-vaxxers to get vaccinated.
0/0	They should be hesitant. Everyone should be
1/1	They should define a point at which enough people are vaxxed and all restrictions are ending. Bc you are wright, otherwise ppl will stop to take the vacc. What for? If everything stays, they will not comply...
0/0	They should do a documentary on severely injured patients from the vaccine and the percentage then
0/0	They should have a cartoon of the daughter of that young mother who died after the vax...putting flowers on her mother's grave.
1/1	They should have as many factories as possible make the vaccine
0/0	They should have been tried long ago. From the illegal curfews to now the killer vaccines. Kenyans are timid to let these crooks get away to murder
1/1	They should have darted them with vaccine from drones and helicopters.
1/1	They should have mandated vaccine period.
1/1	They should not be called anti vaxxers They are pro-disease
1/-1	They should pay people for each vaccination.
0/0	They should take this off the market. I‚Äôm not taking this one nor is my family.
1/1	They should use vaccine such as Moderna or Aztra/zeneca with 100% effectiveness and accuracy, not the others with 95%.
1/1	They should've made one of the doctors say "I've had 4 years of medical school while you have had 1 hour searching stuff up on google"
0/1	They started rolling this out at our hospital in January... The 2nd shot made a lot of people sick. I have chosen not to get it.
0/0	They still won't know how "safe and effective" it for several years. Something's not right about this. If it seems too good to be true...
0	They sure are, but we still don't want it, no matter how much they want us to worry that it's in short supply! If it wasn't crimes against humanity and criminal, it would be laughable just how low they are stooping to try to trick us.
0/0	They testing the vaccine on the sick and elderly, if they die it‚Äôll be considered just another covid death
1/1	They think the Public health experts are exaggerating (even in details). These people want to learn the hard way through experiencing yet another surge.
1/1	They think the vaccine is bad for often vague reasons and then point to things like "magnetism" or "shedding" as post hoc justifications for their thinking. That's also why they're so quick to pick up new theories.
0/0	They think their only solution is a vaccine and they get paranoid if they don‚Äôt have a vaccine for every virus and infectious desease.
0/0	They told us lead paint , tephlon frying pans, thalidomide, mercury fillings and a million other things were safe too.
1/0	They told us, you can still get it, it just won't be as severe. But people always hear what they want to hear
0/0	They treat people like children to control. They told you to be scared to keep their control.
0	They trippin! My kid ain‚Äôt getting one. I‚Äôll easily pull him out of Public school. That simple.
0/0	They used taxpayers money to buy the vaccine and they also use the taxpayers money to dispose the waste...
0/-1	They uses the old technology‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.the ones we use for the flu vaccines every year.
0/0	They want a CASHLESS SOCIETY and DIGITAL ID's for everyone, vaccine passports will transition to digital id's. I said this months ago and you all cried the "tin foil hat" line. Next they will want to vaccinate your children to get them "in the system" early. That's what it's all been about.
0/0	They want depopulation to start as soon as possible.
0/0	They want everyone vaccinated thats bullshit. My unvaccinated gang is here to support me.
0/0	They want gps tracking, injection, censorship, entry denial & general bullying powers. Anything that doesn‚Äôt support that ‚Äúisn‚Äôt real.‚Äù
1/1	They want medical science to save them if hospitalized, yet won‚Äôt save themselves with a vaccine created with the same scientific process.
0/0	They want to Gene edit the human race. Mark my words
0/0	They want to be richer, they don't care about the people.
0/0	They want to force something that has not been proven to be anymore effective at stopping transmission than wearing a mask and social distancing, which all of a sudden are not "safe" enough now.
0/0	They want to force something that has not been proven to be anymore effective at stopping transmission than wearing a mask and social distancing, which all of a sudden are not "safe" enough now...

1/0	They will come up with another one anyday to control the masses!!
1/1	They will distribute the high risk people vaccines first. Get the vaccine if you can.
0/0	They will never admit it was their vaccine. They have millions of doses they want to inject into us. Besides, the underlying reason for this vaccine is not for the bogus COVID, but for population control.
1/-1	They will refuse because it‚Äôs something to refuse and be against.. nothing more
1	They will survive it I had mine no side effects at alk
0/0	They won't tell you how many have died or had bad side effects from the vax will they?
1/1	They work

0/0	They're even warning people about the side effects, people still think it's safe to take and forcing others to be sheep's with them pfft.
1/1	They're exactly the people clogging up the hospitals because they're unvaccinated and wait until the 11th hour to seek professional treatment. What do you mean?
0/0	They're hearing the COVID-19 vaccine was rushed, that it's still under Emergency Use Authorization so it's not fully licensed under the FDA
0/0	They're never jabbing that stuff in my arm ... it isn't a cure anyway
0/0	They're not vaccines they're gene therapies.

0/0	Theyll shove us full of illegal, "covid positive" immigrants until they get their fear so deep everyone gets their vaccines... if covid is sooooo bad where are the homeless deaths... why are we trucking in 1000s of illegals a day and releasing them after they test positive lol
0/0	Theyre doing it on tv so the sheep will say i saw mr. so and so do it live on tv! They couldnt fake it! Its safe! We wouldnt fake injecting the real poison into our bodies. Shame on all of them. Both sides of the bird. What a let down these self appointed leaders are. Just cuz you enter a ballot doesnt mean it gets counted fairly.

0/0	Theyre keeping sheep.
0/0	They‚Äòre not coming near me with that vaccine! We should have a choice.
0/0	They‚Äôll probably be reluctant to take a vaccine which has been created in a year when it normally takes decades to make sure they are safe and if you aren‚Äôt worried about the safety of it then that‚Äôs odd
0/0	They‚Äôll probably eventually suggest to vaccinate once a month for everyone to be really safe
1/1	They‚Äôre all 100% effective at keeping you out of the hospital.
0/0	They‚Äôre all psychopaths working for #BillGates the biggest psychopath of them all. Don‚Äôt say vaccine to save lives, say vaccine for profits & control. Speak the truth!

0/0	They‚Äôre welcome to their vaccine induced immunity deficiency syndrome.

0/0	Think about it, a company created 10 years ago...has never had anything approved ever is pushing a vaccine for a pandemic. If that doesn‚Äôt set off the fire alarm I don‚Äôt know what else could

0/0	Think their pockets are full now...so they can stop making this crap now
0/-1	Third additional shot of the COVID-19 vaccine is said to reactivate the body to fight against the coronavirus, training our body to recognize and better defend itself against the coronavirus should we be exposed.

0/0	This ""vaccine"" is nothing short of a big ugly joke
0/0	This "Dr" has been a huge CV19 shill since the beginning! I watched him at first and believed he is here to help, very soon realized he is a pharma sellout!
1/-1	This "situation" is destroying people mentally, you are bond to see this happen more and more. And also some people have lost everything and one should be carefull of someone who has nothing to lose.
1/1/1/1	This Astra Zeneca vaccine have more benefits than its side effects the most discussed is clotting in some patients and 7 deaths related it. The people with certain age groups and existing comorbidities might be candidates of clotting but not always everyone life threatening. Vaccine should be continued to be taken accordingly. It is responsibility of the people to take care of their other health issues too so alongside vaccine strictly followed SOPs will minimize the the danger. Let‚Äôs hope for the better
0/0	This COVAIDS plandemic will go down as the biggest medical fraud in eugenics driven democide and genocide in recorded history.
1/1	This COVID Vaccine works
1/1	This COVID-19 is no joke. Please take maximum possible precautions which include wearing masks, personal hygiene, physical distancing, keeping indoors as much as possible, and taking the available vaccine when possible.
0/-1	This Covid is fucked up ain‚Äôt it had all 3 jabs and still test positive
0/0	This Covid vaccine has only been given since December, so the long-term health effects are still unknown. It‚Äôs not FDA-approved, and it‚Äôs still being studied in clinical trials. There is a Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System where you can go look up how many people have been killed or paralyzed by the shot. Want to guess the number? Meanwhile, pharmaceutical companies have been granted immunity from liability by the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act. If you're not in the 0.02% of elderly and people with comorbidities who die from Covid, then the only reason to take the shot is because of Covid-phobia: irrational fear of Covid.
0/0	This RNA technology is new. "Hydrogel technology" means nanotechnology. So if you got the vaccine remember that you are taking part in a experimental and new treatment .
0/0	This Vaccine is made to turn people into sideboards And I believe I got on somebody‚Äôs nerves already for stating the truth
0/0	This Vaccine is trash, people who took it are obviously more susceptible to catching Omicron then people who didn't take the Vaccine, just look at Israels case rates, ~98% vaccinated and more cases per capita then any other country in the world! The numbers don't lie, this Vaccine is hands down the worst Vaccine to ever come to market.
0/-1	This Vaccine matter has been more a Commercial/Political activity than subject matter medical research !
0/0	This Witch is lying look at the swollen tongue Guy that had the vaccine
0/1	This all seems quite logical and follows what you'd expect based on established science. Any policy that doesn't consider natural immunity is effectively anti-scientific. Based on available data, I also don't see an argument for giving people with natural immunity any vaccine at all, as it would not offer statistically relevant protection. What we now need are studies on the longevity of natural immunity. Thanks Dr. John.
1/1	This all seems very promising and hopefully we really can be back to normal by Spring.
0/0	This alone makes me never want to get it
1/-1	This amazing kid wanted to get her first #CovidVaccine with her amazing brother and sister on her birthday, and to share that birthday, and her cupcakes, with us. And this is why pediatrics is the best specialty ever. (with permission)
0/0	This anchor is completely clueless üôÑ..Bravo Dr.....Kay u can have his share n mine share of the vaccine. all urs n ur family
1	This annoys me. I got meningococcal septicaemia when I was younger because a vaccination wasn't available. I had all 4 limbs amputated and if a vaccination had been available at the time I wouldn't have had to go through that.
1/1	This anti-vaxxer at work told me I would no longer be able to have babies anymore after getting the covid vaccine and I looked her in the eyes and said ‚Äúso it‚Äôs a 2 for 1?‚Äù
0/0/0	This are still early stages for side effects, give it five years
0/-1	This article is so full of half truths and misinformation it‚Äôs too lengthy to write. All the truth about the animal studies which resulted in most of them dying, known adverse reactions, and lack of long term human trials is easily found in the internet. This technology was abandoned in 2012 for these reasons. Irrefutable. Historical fact. VAERS has recorded nearly 14k deaths in the US post vaccinations. These injections are NOT finished science and are NOT safe.
0/-1	This article was brought to you by.....Pfizer!
1/-1	This bridge is 99.997% safe, best not use it in case it fails
1/1	This bridge is only 99% safe so we should just swim in the shark infested water
0/0	This butcher now introducing vaccins. Not to heal you both to make you slave from medicine. Weakening your immunity and final kill you.
1/1	This by definition means that the vaccine is protective against myocarditis. Yeah I said it
1/1	This cannot be understated - these #CovidVaccines prevent severe disease, hospitalizations, and ICU admissions, reducing #COVID19 to a manageable illness while preserving healthcare capacity and function.
1/-1	This certainly puts vaccine issues into perspective. Thank you for the clarity
0/0	This chemical vaccination TAKES lives as well as 'saving' them. Very long odds, you say, but the axe has to fall somewhere, perhaps it'll be you. Not me though, I want to stay alive and healthy, so somebody else can have my chemicals.
0/0	This citizen of rural area DOES NOT want the experimental drug

0/0	This country is not to be trusted when rolling out anything in such a short time.
0/-1	This covid thing is so overrated by now ,it's ridiculous if you ask me at this point. So over it.i dont even look at the covid news. Sick and tired how the media hypes this up
0/1	This covid will never end. My arm still hurt from the Pfizer vaccine
0/0/0	This days the government cannot be trusted because if you have fever or flue they will just say you have covid...
1/-1	This definitely makes me feel better about my side effects after getting the vaccine. Cause wow I've been tired.
0/0	This doctor actually said here that he wasn't concerned about elderly dying after vaccination because they die anyways... Wow!
1/1/1/1	This doctor gives me hope. I had the first Moderna shot, and am so scared to get the second, because of what I hear. After watching people with Covid-19 online......the shot is worth it.
1/-1	This doctor knows what he's talking about.
1/0	This doctor needs to be fired. Should've brought in a doctor who isn't insane refusing vaccine to debate him so his lies about vaccine could be revealed. He's constantly backtracking whenever he's called out.
1	This doen't really make sense. What difference does it make if the testing took place during one peak vs another? Even if there are more people infected around, that shouldn't change anything. The vaccine should protect you regardless.
0/0	This dude is a gate keeper ! a mouthpiece for big pharma !
0/-1	This entire covit19 was to FORCE FLU VACCCINATE every human being on the planet as to get HERD IMMUNITY AGAINST A HEALTY LIFE
0/0	This entire pandemic was just to VACCINATE ALL OF HUMANITY for population control
1/-1	This group should get together with those who stormed the capital. They could make it into the Guiness record book: world's greatest gathering of certifiable blithering idiots.
0/0	This guy is a shill, only Jesus can save us NOT a vaccine.
0/-1	This guy is just saying not true\" \"not true\" without explaining why
0/0	This guy should be in jail the vaccine is killing people.
0/0	This happened to me! I got my first dose and a few weeks later I was hospitalized and my platelets were VERY low and my red blood cells were EXTREMELY high. The doctor said I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be alive. I had the Pfizer vaccine. I regret I ever got that shot.
0/-1	This has been rushed. It seems as though its been a race to get the rollout done as quick as possible, as if its a competition. No thank you‚Ä¶
0/0	This has done absolutely nothing to persuade me to get this jab.
0/-1	This has got to be the biggest bamboozle in history.
1/1	This has never been a bigger issue than now!! Please vaccinate for yourself, your loved ones, and your whole community.
0/-1	This has not been engineered to stop by vaccine!
0/-1	This has passed China ccp level.
0/0/0/0	This helped me decide that I will not be taking the experimental jab!! Thank you. !!
1/1	This helps a ton in getting friends and family with vaccine hesidencie to get vaccinated.
0/0	This hoax vaccine is simply a step towards population control. Wait a couple years and we'll really see the results...smdh...
0/0	This idiot thinks vaccines are good but with zero long term peer reviewed studies I can pass on these for obvious reasons.
1/1	This if confirmed would be a monumental feat. One actual vaccine that prevents all colds common or novel. After seeing the severe fatigue coronavirus can cause first hand it is understandable the military would do everything in its power to create a solution quickly. Readiness must be maintained.
0/1	This info won't matter much to the idiots out there afraid of a cold virus that kills less than 0.02% of its infectees. Encourage idiots to take the covid shots.
0/0	This is 1000% political bullshit. First they said it was 100% effective, and now that there are more virus variants, we suddenly have vaccine variants that were never announced?
1/-1	This is Darwin at work, let him be, thinning the herd.
0/0	This is FAR below the standard of investigative journalism I expected from the Guardian. Simple fact: When there are millions if not billions of dollars to be made from a product the manufacturers and marketeers of said product need to be scrutinised for the claims they are making regarding efficacy and safety. When a company or industry is fabulously wealthy we should assume - if we are to learn anything from history - that they will be massaging the statistics in their favour. and spending a lot of money to suppress negative press. I'm old enough to remember when medical doctors were recommending people take up smoking to "calm the nerves" and you couldn't walk a hundred yards or watch a sporting event without being inundated with tobacco advertising. Really that wasn't that long ago, and it was the same 'science' that was manipulated for decades until the evidence eventually stacked up to be irrefutable - but only after millions had died. Second simple fact: if a product is 99.9% safe but is sold/supplied/given to tens if not hundreds of millions of people then it's reasonable to expect the 0.1% to be a very angry, very vocal minority that, given the numbers involved, adds up to a considerable number of people across the world. If you then factor in that the vaccine regimen for children in some states of the USA is totally driven by Big Pharma and VERY different to the relatively sane and mostly scientifically driven regimens applied in the UK and Europe, you realise that the odds of your child being in the 0.1% is a very worrying probability. Now I've just used an arbitrary 0.1% to make my point. In reality vaccines are all very different and have hugely differing rates of vaccinosis depending on age and pre-existing health conditions, but the third simple fact is that anyone insisting that all vaccines are universally 100% safe is talking politics NOT science. That all said you should really ignore my concerns because I was part of the loony fringe that thought that politicians might just maybe be getting a few too many back handers from the tobacco companies . . .
1/1/1/1	This is GREAT another another weapon in this heinous pandemic now we don't have to depend on just one vaccine. A third vaccine would be awesome and probably on the way.
0/0	This is Not a 'vaccine'; it is an injection of the spike protein designed to produce a robust anti-body response .. a poor substitute for the true immunological response triggered by an actual vaccine. However, the spike protein has failed to remain in the arm area as it was designed to do and instead it rapidly collects in the spleen. Not good. Then gets right into the Lymph system and invades all major organs with Spike protein. Frankly, you have to be kind of ignorant and naive to submit to a still very experimental injection of a known pathogen
1/1	This is SO wrong. You should not give place to anti vaccines people. They do not have ANY scientific support so this is NOT BALANCED.
0/0	This is TOTALITARIANISM through and through !!! With Covid, all major pillars of western values like: human rights, liberty, own-body autonomy, privacy, consent, freedom from fear / coercion / discrimination / persecution are all out of the window, down the drain, blown up to pieces !!! So, they are ALL LIES and PROPAGANDA, used only to brainwash the non-western world, and as excuses to invade resources-rich countries !!!
0/0	This is a RNA editing vaccine. That is an issue. I refuse it.
1/1	This is a clearly expressed and informative video about the process of ensuring that vaccines are safe. Reassuring to learn of the steps being taken. It does not seek to address the tiny number of adverse events that have occurred - and rightly so. That's for another video. Thank you WHO for working so hard - and I appreciate it's cumulative work built up over decades, not just a knee-jerk reaction to this particular pandemic.
0/-1	This is a disaster waiting to happen‚Ä¶
0/0	This is a disgrace' promoting something that is not even a vaccine and is not tested and possibly not safe....... aghhhhhh
1/1	This is a good thing.
1/1	This is a historic, colossal achievement from both a medical innovation perspective and a logistics perspective. These massive efforts are supposed to be the sort of thing that central planning excels at, but it is very comforting to see America able to execute as well.
1/-1	This is a huge step for bioprocessing as a whole
0/0	This is a lie. This is the mark of the beast. Wake up people.
0/0	This is a mass experiment that should have been in a laboratory with animals & NOT ON PEOPLE
1/-1	This is a mistake for the history books. It's obviously going to cause more blood clots than it prevents - COVID makes clots a lot more often than one in a million. Where do you get off calling that "caution"?
1/1	This is a mistake. Literally a less than 1 in a million chance of a side effect but your pause will permanently convince several million of those "waiting to see" that they should never be vaccinated. Way more than one in a million of those people will die from covid.
1/-1	This is a multifactorial issue. It's not just one thing, and making it sound like it is does not help with vaccine confidence
0/0	This is a new science for which we still don‚Äôt know the long-term effects that could result on the human body.
0/0	This is a no brainer. AZ and J&J , both have been recalled & suspended due to blood clot complications. But we have a very stubborn govt led by filthy & greedy cartels. They don't care about saving lives. As far as they're concerned ; Money talks bulshit works.
0/0	This is a not a regular vaccine, it is an RNA Vaccine which is going to make a mess with your DNA, nothing we experimented before. Should you be concern? Well what we know about it? We will need at least 10 years of testing before to know about it. i personally say no, can be very dangerous and I won‚Äôt do it at all.
1/1	This is a one in a million chance, and that don't even know if the vaccine caused it. You are twice as likely to be hit by lightning, that have a blood clot from the vaccine. Facts matter people, don't let the Trump hysteria scare you.
1/1	This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Protect yourself and others. Get VAXED!
0/-1	This is a perfect example of the banality of evil.
0/1	This is a plain and simple lie. 23 people in Norway died after the vaccine. Not from adverse reactions. They vaccinated the very elderly and some of them died. No evidence of death linked to the vaccine. Stop spreading dangerous disinformation.
1/0	This is a proper vaccine. Vaccines take a long time to develop for a lot of reasons, it doesn‚Äôt mean this one was rushed because it was done quickly.
1/1	This is a public health issue, not a political one. Refusing to vaccinate one's children in opposition to the government makes no sense. Look at the hospitalization curves for covid in children, that should be enough to convince you. We don't care about Macron here.
1/1	This is a vaccine I would definitely consider.
0/0	This is a virus, regardless of the vaccine and the virus will never go away.
1/1	This is a war, and antivaxxers are the enemy combatants
0/0	This is a world without one vaccine...
0/0	This is absolute lies. Friend of my got vaccines and got pretty sick. I do not believe in immunization. There is definitely side affect
1/1	This is absolutely brilliant. The result of many decades of work. Just at the right time. Science coming to the rescue. This should be made in a movie!
0/0	This is absolutely hilarious. I'd like to meet the person who means to force me to 0take a shot I don't want.
1/-1	This is absolutely sad: people use their freedom to deny education about health, and then very disturbing and even stupid claims are made by the same people who have absolutely no idea why they think the way they do.
1/1	This is actually a valid question. So a vaccine doesn‚Äôt completely prevent a virus from infecting your body, but it helps your body develop what is called antibodies. And antibodies are created so that if that same virus were to infect you again, your body would have immunity built up against that virus, making you not fall as ill.
1	This is actually really smart. If she turns into a zombie, I‚Äôm pretty sure I can outrun a 90 year old zombie.
0/-1	This is all about compliance how far will you go to comply.
0/0	This is all by design. And you fell for it ! What is in the vaccine? You don't know ! You are sheep
1/1	This is all generally as predicted. Like with the flu jab, they‚Äôll be a new one released each year, except we will want a much higher percentage of the population to get it than the flu jab. If having a needle jabbed in my arm twice a year is the price for no more lockdowns, then I‚Äôm more than willing.
1/1/1	This is amazing! I had always thought they used the same traditional process!
1/1	This is amazing, thanks to all scientists and medical workers. Now what we need to do is convincing people that it is safe. That shouldn't be so hard, right?
0/-1	This is an EXPERIMENTAL vacine that has not been tested on animals 1st and you can still catch it and pass it on after taking the vacine,so you are the Guinea pigs wow
0/0	This is an advertisement!!!!!!
1/1	This is an amazing moment in history, a huge thank you to the scientists that made this possible! It's unbelievable that a virus that no one knew existed 12 months ago now not only has a vaccine, but a vaccine that is over 90% effective.
1/1	This is an amazing moment in history, a huge thank you to the scientists that made this possible! It's unbelievable that a virus that no one knew existed 12 months ago now not only has a vaccine, but a vaccine that is over 90% effective. And just as a cherry on top this new mRNA technology could produce effective vaccines to other deadly diseases in the near future. It's not an exaggeration to say this might be the biggest scientific achievement since the moon landings.
1/1	This is an especially important video during these times, to encourage everyone to get vaccinated and reduce the spread of COVID-19
1/1	This is an excellant piece & factual report that hints that its a now a pandemic of the UN vaccinated !!!!
0/0	This is an experimental, untested gene therapy not a vaccine. Potentially reduces symptoms, has major side effects, doesn't stop you from getting sick, doesn't stop transmission, still have to wear a mask? For a condition with only 0.4% of "positive" cases being serious?!?
1/1	This is an unpopular opinion but make it mandatory.
1/0	This is anecdotal but my wife and I both got the vaccine while we were doing IVF. Our thought process was ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre injecting her with all sorts of stuff to get pregnant, what difference will a vaccine make.‚Äù We never saw a positive test during 4 years we tried naturally. But we‚Äôre expecting our first in May.
1/1/1	This is astonishing stuff. There is always some good that comes out of a shitty situation and I think the good that we will get from this pandemic is the advancement of pharmaceutical technologies. This could lead to the cures of so many diseases in the future including cancer!
0/0	This is awful lot like the "educational video" in Jurassic Park explaining how dinosaurs are made...right before they start killing people.
0/0	This is bad! Vaccines r bad
1/1	This is beautiful and inspiring. Shoutout to the doctors and staff that made the vaccine possible. I just got my first dose of the vaccine. Stay safe!
1/1	This is big news. This vaccine, unlike the ones from Moderna and Pfizer we actually have a shot at producing locally. I'd be interested to know if that big order from the government comes with a contract production rider
0/0	This is both funny and sad, it‚Äôs really weird how people just keep saying ‚Äúget vaccinated‚Äù.. even on msnbc, it‚Äôs like who are they talking to? The viewers? Every sick person I know is vaccinated, it‚Äôs like the biggest bamboozle ever.
1/1	This is brilliant news and this should mean we're one step closer to getting a vaccine next year.
0/0	This is bull sh*t !!! IT'S NOT A VACCINE.... IT'S POISON !! Give it to the politicians !!
0/0	This is bullshit! The vaccine is there to kill us all
0/0	This is clandestine warfare. Fake a pandemic and frighten people enough so they accept taking a drug of dubious contents. When people start dying from the vaccine the government will say there‚Äôs a new strain of virus and push more drugs on the People. Wake up, folks, for your childrens‚Äô sake

0/0	This is criminal, it's coercion.
1/1	This is disappointing. We need more vaccine requirements, not less.
0/-1	This is disgusting and criminal and needs to be stopped.
0/0	This is disgusting. No vaccine should be praised by the speed of which it has come out. The fact that everyone is lining up for experimental shots is disturbing.
0/-1	This is embarrassing, Germany comes out with the vaccine and oh sorry we did not order enough, by the way, screw parents we need to open schools?
1/0	This is embarrassing. Polio vaccine,for instance, didn't completely keep you from Polio. It kept you from getting a bad case. The reason it has worked...and this is always the case...is bc a vast majority of ppl got the vaccine. This is no different.
0/0	This is exactly the reason I won't get the vaccine. Were the pharmaceutical companies just hoping to withhold it if president trump was re elected?
0/1	This is exactly why I am not getting this so call vaccine. Wait until months or years to see what it does... don‚Äôt think so!! Wake up people
1/1	This is exactly why this is so exciting... I keep telling everyone I know to go read up on why this new medical tech is so awesome. It's going to change the world and help develop treatments and cures for other fatal diseases

0/0	This is going to be a huge legal issue. How can an employer force you to put something in your body and you take 100% of the responsibility if you have negative side effects? A
0/1	This is gold. I'm so frustrated lately. I see people getting banned from Twitter and YouTube for factual, investigative journalism that happens to embarrass Democrats, and I turn to outlets like Gab and Win to follow those sources and end up finding a bunch of blathering conspiratards ranting about how the vaccine is poison or the Mark of the Beast or whatever. The entire middle is being ripped out of society. There is nowhere left for sane, moderate conservatives to create and distribute their content to sane, moderate consumers who want to consume and discuss it.
1/1	This is good news to the world. Kudos to those brilliant minds.
1/1	This is good news. The point isn't that the vaccine produces an immune response, that was known already, the point is that it also produces an immune response in older people, at least at a sufficiently high rate.
1/1	This is good news. The sooner that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approves it, the better.
1/1	This is good to hear. Maybe after this we should preemptively look for other pandemic viruses and figure out vaccines for those before they start.
1/1	This is good, but this one is less effective than Moderna. I hope I don‚Äôt get stuck with the Johnson and Johnson vaccination.
1/-1	This is good.
1/1	This is great all health care workers should be vaccinated to help protect them as the are doing a fantastic job.
1/1	This is great but the vaccine is not available for everyone as you know. My father is over 65 with a compromise immune system and he still waiting. In the meantime he still goes to work at one of the DC government agencies as he is required to be there.
1/1	This is great news and Hopefully this will be executed as soon as possible and quickly distributed to all ... so everyone will have some chance of normality back in their lives in the new year . Hopefully this will enable companies, shops, tourism, leisure , hospitality sectors, schools, etc ....and all our economy to get saved and slowly get back to normal. Plus our hospitals have a chance to breathe as they all have worked soo incredibly hard ...... over the past year with this awful Pandemic ...
1/1	This is great news for science
1/1	This is great news for the children; however those selfish folks who refuse to get vaccinated have now opened the door to the Delta-Plus variant, which is a new variant that is now circulating in Maryland. Now that Virginia has turned red, the governor may relax restrictions and give this variant an opportunity to circulate more widely. Thanks you, Virginia low-information voters.
1/1	This is great news that vaccines will be out soon! Pharmaceutical innovations can be believed. Can‚Äôt wait to get one
1/1/1	This is great news! I‚Äôm a conservative Catholic. I got the vax.
1/1	This is great news! Moderna has donated an impressive number of vaccine doses to Mexico, which will help to combat the COVID pandemic. Thank you, Moderna, for your generosity!
0/1	This is great news. And I read that people develop quite a high level of immunity 10 days after the first jab so soon we will have hundreds of thousands of our most vulnerable people who will avoid the worst effects of covid should they catch it.
1/1	This is great news. Of the 75,000 people who received the vaccine in a controlled study, NOT ONE PERSON has died of covid and very few have been hospitalized.
1/1	This is great, especially since I'm supposed to be getting my shot. üëç
1/1	This is great, hopefully less cases and death will be reported as more people get vaccinated
1/1	This is great. What's the name of the vaccine? And I'm guessing the human trials went great? That's why it got approved and being used on humans now
0/0	This is honestly terrifying that they can make you put something in your body that took less than a year to develop and that we have no real hard facts on how it effects the human body
0/1	This is horrendous. Get your jab to help someone else live a life! How about personal responsibility for protecting your own life and making the right health choices! Never heard anything so selfish to coerce people to have a vaccine for others! People have a vaccine to protect themselves end of. If a person doesn't need that vaccine they don't get it if they don't want it

0/0	This is insane! The NIH has an article claiming over boosting is reducing antibodies. 1/3 of my coworkers have been pos in last 3 weeks. All vaxxed and boosted. None of the unvaxxed coworkers have gotten in at all.
1/1	This is interesting. Without a depth of education to understand the details with vaccines in this document but I have a thought as a person who generally trusts vaccine efficacy with my physician. Where I am curious is the correlated possibilities of the current measles vaccine as-is as something which already has been a booster. Could it be children, already vaccinated with measles, are possibly why we already have been seeing children/youth less affected by C19? Having a fair education and using a metaphor, I do understand each vaccine is its own unique ‚Äòkey‚Äô and effective in its individual way. Is the measle virus that similar as Covid it was already defending youth? Or have we seen unvaxed measles children respond similarly as vaxed? That is if say the measles vaccine is ‚ÄúATACAA...‚Äù and the C19 vaccine is ‚ÄúATAGAA...‚Äù could those similarities been close-enough to have been the trigger people‚Äôs immune reactions? I‚Äôm not asking rhetorical questions here to prove/push an agenda; just a curious set of thoughts.
1/1	This is it, the end of the dark times
0/0	This is just B.S. The mRNA doesn‚Äôt work. Whatever happened to, my body my choice?
0/0	This is just a fishing op, btw, see if they can get a rise, resist as best you can, there are plenty of good people still: we are many, they are few!
1/1	This is just brilliant. Now we need the public to step up and have the vaccination, the higher the uptake the lower number of cases and more normality for everyone
1/1	This is just my experience. I am NOT trying to scare anyone or discourage anyone from getting the vaccine. A few side effects are normal but I now feel perfectly fine (1 day after getting the vaccine) üòä you would rather experience a day or two of vaccine side effects than possibly lose your life to COVID or spread it to a loved one.

1/0	This is mere statement of Opinion. Provide actual SCIENTIFIC FACTS that prove, scientifically, thst the vaccines dont work or are "bad". Provide it. Thats right - you cant. Youre not educated in this field of knowledge. Its easier for you to spew opinion over facts because doing medical research takes actual Work and effort. It requires critical thought. Which over 72 million americans dont possess.

1/1	This is not a political issue, let us all work together and get back to Living again .Please get your Vaccine.
1/1	This is not a race between humans, it is a race against the Virus.I sincerely hope all the vaccine listed in here will help us beat the virus.
1/1	This is not a simple cold/flu virus. Even those that recover from it have debilitating residual chronic effects. You're far safer with the vaccine even if it didn't work at all. It is not just to save your life but to preserve your quality of life. One example is that people who have suffered CoViD has lost significant lung functionality. It is like they have been smokers their entire life. If you suffer from that it is like having COPD and oxygen tanks for life. If the vaccine protected you against just that alone it would be worth it. Yet there are other debilitating effects like blood clots whether in limbs, brain, or heart. You may survive without the vaccine, but who wants to be among those suffering from effects needlessly.
0/1	This is not a vaccine It‚Äôs a killing machine
0/0	This is not a vaccine at all. It‚Äôs RNA messenger biotech.

0/0	This is not about a virus. This is about increasing the power of the State and weakening personal freedoms.
1/1	This is not the time to be a baby about getting the shot. I got my first COVID shot this morning. My arm does not even hurt. I have seen people moan and fuss over a splinter. Get over it. This is new. I got that. Whatever the side effect is, it is small potatoes compared to what the COVID virus will do to you. You bet I rolled up my sleeve for this shot.
0/0	This is one of those examples where the vaccine could be worse than the disease.
1/1	This is one reason we DO need to focus on vaccinations... It is the single most important thing you could do to protect immunocompromised people like yourself who can't get it. There are other things to talk about for sure, but people in your situation should want everyone else to be vaccinated even if you can't be.
0/0	This is opinion not fact. Maher is somewhere correct. There's no proof as of yet that the lessen symptoms or prevent deaths. But he's right that they don't work. And with the shocking amount of damage and deaths these shots have caused, they should be banned.
0/0	This is parroting, thats what they told you. No ones gotten their hand on the substance so no one knows exactly what it's programmed to do, so you can not be sure. This started with fears of a virus (alleged virus), then restrictions (decimation and total control). They told us, a vaccine would reverse all of this. It's not doing any of that. We know that for sure.
0/0	This is poison
0/0	This is precisely why I‚Äôve been hesitant to have a vaccination. Concerns should be addressed, not censored or mocked
1/1	This is precisely why it‚Äôs important to get vaccinated. The vaccines prevent hospitalization and death.
1/1	This is probably the best news in my life time
0/0	This is propaganda for a vaccine that is neither needed, nor safe. I don't like it!
0/0	This is propaganda, several thousand have died, as many thousands have had allergic reaction.
0/0	This is really disturbing to me for the fact that there is no long term study. I would think that it would be treated like any new experimental drug and be warned against in women pregnant or nursing
1/1	This is really fantastic news for all you that will be having it. Hope it brings you the security you need to start living your lives again.
1/1	This is really interesting, and hopefully. It can get it approved. Also other countries can sign up and produce it. It would be a great boost .
1/1	This is really sad to see even educated people against vaccines‚Ä¶
0/0	This is reasonable. You are very reasonable. What isn‚Äôt reasonable: demanding you to take a non fda approved, new gene editing technology without releasing this data. If it‚Äôs truly safe and effective then you won‚Äôt need 75 years to release the data. And from the data we‚Äôve seen. It‚Äôs not safe or effective. It‚Äôs murderous. And it seems that they are just trying to kill as many of us as possible before the truth comes out.
0/0	This is repulsive. I will NOT be getting this toxic crap. I'm not an idiot
1/1	This is ridiculous. Millons have already received this vaccine (including myself) without issue. 6 people out of millions is barely a blip and makes it extremely rare.
1/-1	This is ridiculous. To start with, the largest studies dispelling the MMR vaccine-autism "link" are not even American, but Scandinavian, so even if an American organisation fiddle with the data to "cover up" things, there are plenty of other studies that explore the potential link between MMR and autism and find there is none. The only one study that does find a link is the Wakefield study, with was retracted due to being fraudulent. Also, I'd like to gently remind everyone re. graphs that correlation does NOT equal causation. The apparent rise in autism is disputed too. There is a rise in autism DIAGNOSES, but then a lot of things that were previously diagnosed as retardation or childhood psychosis or (in the Asperger end of the autism spectrum) not diagnosed at all, is today diagnosed as autism spectrum disorders. Also, please just cut it and wake up from the Antivaxxer conspiracy. The impacts of not vaccinating children due to the fictive MMR-autism link cause serious harm in society, such as vulnerable people (babies, old, sick) suffering and dying from preventable diseases, and people with immune deficiencies having to avoid others and live in fear because they can no longer trust that they are protected by the general societal herd immunity, as it is slipping under the minimum required proportions for a number of severe, once eradicated diseases. The MMR-autism myth is great material for epic drama, but the drama (like this movie) is responsible for a lot of real life tragedies that can easily be avoided.
1/1	This is ridiculous... tactic to scare people .. no positive evidence that the clots or death were directly attributable to the vaccine. With this fear tactic people will die of Covid by not getting the vaccine.
1/1	This is safest vaccine by miles, same principle as flu vaccine, other vaccines are first it's kind.
1/1	This is shocking ......hopefully the vaccine reduces these numbers
0/0	This is sickening. No to vaccine.
1/1	This is simply not true. It can be defeated with mass vaccination, contact tracing, and effective quarantines and testing. Multiple countries have proven the virus can be eliminated. Laziness is not an excuse.
1/1	This is so annoying. I had mine yesterday and yes aching and got the chills but the alternative is so much worse. Get the jab!
0/0	This is so bad. Moderna is a start up. They changed their name from ModeRNA. They don't have a single FDA approved medication. They have failed drug trials. They have never made a successful vaccine. ALSO! They are trying to invent a new mRNA vaccine that tricks, trains, triggers, your DNA. Never been done before. This is a company Bill Gates pushes. This is the conspiracy theories from Alex Jones coming true
0/-1	This is so cringe it‚Äôs actually sinister. How are these lies allowed ?
1/1	This is so exciting to watch. Let‚Äôs hope life is on its way back to normal! And hopefully this will lead to no more covid deaths.
0/0	This is so freaking sick. It's only a matter of time before they make it available for unborn and new born babies. What the hell has happened to this world?
1/1	This is so frustrating! All-day long today all I have heard is people declining the vaccine over stuff like this or 'Because my friend's son's wife's best friend posted on Facebook that vaccines are bad' It's ridiculous how unwilling people are to protect themselves and others.
1/1	This is so hard to watch. My mother died back in December and she didn‚Äôt have the option of getting the vaccine, but she would have taken it if it was available. It‚Äôs heartbreaking to see these people because they could have prevented if. Yes people are getting sick, but the odds of dying are highly reduced when vaccinated.
1/0	This is so incredibly irresponsible on a public health level. I‚Äôm sorry 6 women have had adverse side effects but you cannot tell me pausing rollout of millions of safe vaccines to an already hesitant population outweighs the crisis we‚Äôre facing. You‚Äôre doing so much damage.
0/0	This is so misleading. The vaccine is killing people. All lies
0/0	This is so sad to read the comments on so many reports like this one. People look what the mainstream media and our government have done to our faith. I along with so many don't believe anything anymore. Sad days ahead for the world I believe.
1/1	This is so sad. There are a lot of "if only's" going on. Please get your vaccinations.
0	This is so stupid, the countries whit higher vaccination are the countries with more cases.

1/1/1	This is such a massive milestone to develop a Covid vaccine so quickly. Science is awesome.
1/1	This is such great news; the JJ vaccine is a boon for poorer countries who haven't even received any vaccines yet. Disparities abound and I'm relieved many tens of millions of people should start getting this vaccine 'soon'.
0/0	This is the Great Experiment. We're all experiments in this. And we have no idea what it will affect in a year, or 2 years, or 10 years.
0/0	This is the actual "Operation Warp Speed". The current jabs were the only option to stop the WEF from shutting down the world and a billion deaths over a decade. But now that we know those are no longer effective, STOP injecting the poison.
1/1	This is the beginning of the END. Please get your COVID vaccine! How cool that the nurse with the needle is my RA patient
0	This is the beginning of when people will realise nothing will improve in terms of restrictions after getting the vaccine. Everyone has been duped.

1	This is the key factor that matters the most. Even if cases rise again in the future, it won't be that much of an issue if hospitalizations drop down to (and stay at) a manageable level
0/0	This is the latest update on the vaccine and it was 2 weeks ago. We are all gonna die.
1/1	This is the light at the end of a miserable tunnel. Thank god for the vaccine.
1/1	This is the one I have been waiting for. One and done. No messing around trying to get a second dose.
1/1	This is the one I want when it's my turn. Great stuff.
1/1	This is the only way to get rid of COVID
1/1	This is the only way we can hope to get back to any sort of normality at all. Not very keen on all this negative feedback. We are all living with COVID it‚Äôs irrelevant where it started, what mistakes have been made we now all need to pull together and help each other. Then when we are ALL through this is the time all the other issues can be addressed.
1/1	This is the point when vaccination were available to everybody. Makes sense to measure from the point people could do something real to prevent death.
1/1	This is the right decision, vaccination is not just a personal choice. It affects society and the people around you. If someone gets sick of covid and ends up in in hospital, guess who has to pay for it? I find it hilarous that people complain about this fairly minor 'violation' of personal freedom, but have no problem with stuff like mandatory military service
1/1	This is the right thinking. The science is there. Being obese or even overweight does put you at risk. Listen to the guidance. If you are eligible do not double think, get vaccinated. The sooner we can get the majority of people vaccinated the better the system can help all those that do need it.
0/0	This is the same energy as "if random news anchor jumps off a bridge, would you do it too?" NO i will NOT. If you wanna be a clown and get the mark of the beast, that's on you. They need stop tryna force us and leave us alone! We don't consentüò†

1/1	This is what pushed me over the edge to get vaccinated NOW- knowing I can pass some protection on to my newborn baby. Otherwise, I probably would have held off a while and waited to see more data on the longevity of the protection, etc.
1	This is what scares me. My husband is military and I'm not a fan of the idea of him being used as a guinea pig.
0/0	This is what was shown in the Pfizer study supposedly saying the vaccine was effective to get EUA approval. When other doctors looked at the all cause mortality (everyone who died of any cause), instead of COVID cases, more vaccinated people died.
1/1	This is what we need in the vaccines - a reduction in hospitalizations and deaths. If J&J can do it with one shot and at least extreme temperatures holdings this is great
1/1	This is what we need...factual information backed with science. Thank you, Doctor.
1/1	This is where I am a selfish bastard. I don‚Äôt care. When the vaccine is available, I will get it as soon as possible because I believe in the science behind it and believe the benefits greatly outweigh the risks.
1/1	This is where under funding education and Healthcare has gotten us. Eating freaking dewormer, when a perfectly good vaccine is right there.

0/0	This is why I don‚Äôt vaccinate. Non of them are 100%effective.
1/0	This is why I hate them: they'll prolong the pandemic by ensuring that the virus is never eradicated and allowed to continually mutate, perhaps causing us all to watch Covid The Sequel at some point in the future.

0/-1	This is why my faith in Jesus cuz is the only one that can save us from this corruption. May he protect us all with in his will amen
1/1	This is why not getting vaccinated is *not* just a personal choice. It could potentially spread covid to other people & gives covid a chance to mutate into something that could endanger everyone else.
0/-1	This is why we don't create vaccinations at "warp speed."
1/1/1	This is why we must always fund R&D. One never knows how it might help, nor when we may need that help.

0/0	This isn't about health. This is about control. Don't let them inject your children just because you've been gaslit into believing you're a bad parent if you don't.
0/0	This isn‚Äôt about a virus and it‚Äôs not about ‚Äúsaving lives‚Äù. That notion is laughable. This is about a major unprecedented push for control globally.
0/0	This isn‚Äôt about health this is about wealth
1/1	This isn‚Äôt even funny. Get the shot, trust the science.
1/-1	This js unexpected that EMA give approval before the UK as much of the trial and manufacturing is done.in.thr UK this is good news tho this jab is cheaper and the requirements on cold chain is not as much as the MRNA
1/0	This just proves how much technology has progressed. Vaccines usually take years to devolve and require live samples and now it can be produced with a genetic code on a computer screen.
0/0	This just reinforces my decision not to get it lol
0/0	This just shows how underdeveloped this vaccine is. We do not know enough information to argue these complications.
0/0	This lady where my dad works died from the vaccine
1/1	This little old man gets his vaccine shot! Are you keeping up with your vaccines?
1/1	This looks promising #VaccinesWork
0/0	This mRNA is totally experimental and should not be pushed.
1/1	This made me feel better. Getting mine on Thursday!
0/0	This makes it sound like playing Russian roulette. Only with a gun that holds a million bullets
1/1	This makes me feel lovely, since I got an original Pfizer dose, but just boosted Saturday w/ Moderna.
0/0	This makes me sick, I'm proud for sticking up for themselves instead of being forced to get something that can be harmful to there health
1/1	This makes me very happy I have a 6 and 3 year old I want them Protected accidentally myself I just haven't gotten my six-year-old done cause I don't know if his pediatrician has it

1/1	This message is a call to mobilise for vaccination. Protect yourself.
1/1	This message is needed and I am glad an Islamic scholar is urging his community and people of his faith to take the vaccine.
1/1	This morning I tested positive for COVID-19. I feel fine, and will continue to work remotely this week, as per public health guidelines. Please go and get the vaccine and the booster dose.
0/0	This morning appointment with a doctor...he asks me„Ääare you vaccinated?„ÄãI tell him NO‚Ä¶ He tells me „ÄäBravo hold on...we are going to win...„ÄãI thought I was going to cry with joy,
1/1	This morning, I tested positive for COVID-19. I‚Äôm feeling fine ‚Äì and I‚Äôll continue to work remotely this week while following public health guidelines. Everyone, please get vaccinated and get boosted.
1/1	This needs to be standard everywhere. I'll line up at 3am even if I have to get it jabbed in my dick, just get this over with!
0/0	This new technology is not tested
1/1	This new vaccine technology is impressive!
0/-1	This news brought to you by Pfizer.
0/0	This one has been rushed, limited trials, etc...
0/0	This only heighten the fact that I will not be taking the vaccine...
1/1/1	This pandemic REALLY sucks on so many levels, but here we go with the third wave. There is hope with vaccines. We need to be super smart over these next few weeks to turbo mass vaccinate and all take necessary precautions. As hard as it is, this is truly our fastest way forwards.
1/1	This pandemic wont end as long as there's still people disseminating misinformation to avoid following public health policies and initiatives that can protect citizens against a deadly, mutating virus
0/0	This people are the reason botlle that says POISON also needs to say DONT DRINK. idiots are literally trusting facebook posts more than doctors and scientists
0/0	This poor lady seems like such a beautiful soul. I pray she and all the people who have been harmed by the vaccine make a full recovery.
1/1	This press conference convinced me to take a shot
0/0	This pro-vaccination propaganda is getting ridiculous. I will still not do it no matter what you say in the news.
1/1	This protects the whole population. If you're not taking it be ok witt not beeing allowed to access restaurants etc.
1/1	This really puts those numbers into perspective. And it's good to know that despite the difference in the numbers, each vaccine is safe enough to keep me away from the hospital or death.
1/1	This really shouldn‚Äôt be a question. The vaccine for Covid-19 was created by licensed medical scientists and doctors to numb the effects of the virus. REMINDER: This does NOT mean that the vaccine makes you immune to Covid-19 and it‚Äôs strains. You can still just as easily get it from a spreader if you are or are not vaccinated. The job of a vaccine is to lessen the pain and sickness of a virus. This is also what the vaccine for Influenza does. The vaccine does not kill people. About 8,000 people die every day in the United States alone. Because this number is so high, there‚Äôs bound to be a few natural deaths of people who were just vaccinated the same day. I can tell you that I, and my whole family was vaccinated and nothing has happened. The shot was even painless. You should get vaccinated. It is extremely easy to do so, and you‚Äôre potentially saving thousands of lives. Not to mention, you‚Äôre saving hundreds of thousands of animals and pets that cannot choose to get the vaccine or not. Yes, Covid-19 effects animals, too. And, if you‚Äôre too incompetent to get the shot, imagine a golden retriever out in a field slowly dying from the Coronavirus. You could‚Äôve caused that by not being vaccinated. Not everyone dies from it, but many do. You also cannot tell if you have it or not. Some people contract it and then it goes away and they‚Äôd never know they had it. If people don‚Äôt choose to become vaccinated to eliminate this virus, it will become the next flu. If you offered a vaccine to the Flu a hundred years ago, think about how quickly they‚Äôd start using it. Please be smart and get a vaccine. You can easily find them at your local drugstore.
1/1	This reminds me that the US is not a nimble nation, but a freight train. Nothing ever seems to be great at the start but once we get going, we really get going.
0/0	This reserge could also be those suffering from the COVID vaccines given .. true .. i already personally know of several friends and family that their vaccines brought them into major suffering ..
0/0/0	This second dose of this vaccine is killer...
0/0	This shit is all a joke, I‚Äôm not falling for any of it
0/0	This shot will kill more people than the Rona has
1/1	This should be used for sure! for women who use birth control they should be monitored or just be offered Pzifer or Moderna.
1	This shows the limits of technology, record breaking vaccine creation, instant worldwide communication, other technologies like machine learning, mRNA, etc etc.. it all comes down to human cooperation and information
0/0	This smugness we saw from the vaccine crowd a few months ago is long gone.
1/1	This sounds brilliant, a much better approach compared to growing more of a deadly virus and injecting it in a weakened state into people like we currently do.
1/1	This sounds terrible but for the greater good of society I believe that the risks of the vaccine, however terrible must be set to the side as we deal with the more prevalent issue of a virus that has disrupted the entire global economy and nearly everyone's daily life. It's a risk, but a risk we should be willing to take.
1/0	This sounds very inefficient and similar stories emerging with the Valneva jab. I really hope it become more organised quickly as we are all missing our families across Europe.
1/1	This statistics is not important. Accelerate vaccinations. Vaccinate all school children. Train more nurses to inject vaccine. Complete vaccine trials‚Ä¶
1/1	This story emphasized children, it's also important for adults to keep their vaccinations up. Some vaccines may protect for a lifetime, but many don't and need a booster shot.
1/1	This talk with the risks of vaccinating is so tiring. Just do it and improve your lives and ours for once!
1/1	This technology is pretty cool, got my first dose a few days ago
0/0	This thing is radically different from any other. It modifies DNA, it was rushed through by people that have no liability and have been repeatedly found to knowingly use noxious substances. And they want to force it! The modification potential alone should make everyone run for the hills.
0/-1	This tracks. I‚Äôve been baffled by the suggestion of many to get vaccinated or get a booster two weeks after recovering from covid. This just flies against all logic and knowledge of basic immunology to me. I thought 90 days but 6 months sounds about right too
1/1	This tweet is for all the people who are refusing the #CovidVaccine . I wonder how you would have felt if your mom/dad refused the polio vaccine?Or Measles Mumps Rubella?Thinking face #justathought #getyourheadoutofyourbutt #GetVaccinated
1/1	This type of vaccine is new, but research and development on it has been underway for decades.
0/0	This untested vaccination for a virtually harmless virus is designed to cull the weak and particularly the weak minded. These sad creatures are the remoaners/Corona cowards, I understand that it is intended that these will die within two years. Great, the world will be a much better place free of the real virus, the lefties.Y
0/0	This untested vaccine has been allowed immunity from prosecution if there are side effects, that tells you everything. Side effects may be as little as a cold, or you may die.
0/0	This vaccination get more and more confusing. Not strange people dont trust it. We hear so many different things almost from day to day. I don't think the developers know a lot themselves
0	This vaccination has been the most barberous pratice and one of the most fatal.
0/0	This vaccination programme is a "trial" All involved will be on trial in the future for assisting in genocide.
0/0	This vaccination will lead to something not to prevent Corona virus please
1/1	This vaccine Actually sounds brilliant! I pray to God we can make it another year or two..
1/1	This vaccine cannot get to New York fast enough.
0/0	This vaccine could leave everyone who takes it with AIDS and many, many more hideous diseases.
0/0	This vaccine does not prevent you from getting or spreading Covid. God gave me an immune system for a reason. I will take my chances. I‚Äôm not saying that people shouldn‚Äôt get the vaccine but it should be their choice. For me, it‚Äôs a hard pass.
1/1	This vaccine fine.. thats what happens.. for a cure..
0/0	This vaccine has DNA from aborted babies, I won't be taking it.
1/1	This vaccine has already probably saved many many times more lives
0/0	This vaccine has also made women infertile. And tell me there‚Äôs not enough proof to prove it‚Äôs the vaccine. But what proof is there to say it isn‚Äôt ?
1/1	This vaccine has always been safe from the start, unfortunately the media tried to ruin the vaccine's reputation and EU countries tried to sabotage the UK. Full stop.
1/1	This vaccine has been tested and found to be acceptably safe and efficacious. If the blood clotting is linked to the vaccine I consider that to be an acceptable risk. The danger of death from COVID-19 is much greater.
1/1	This vaccine has been under development since SARS, about 20 years ago. The information needs to be put out there by every network - it's not so 'brand new', and there has been significant testing.
0/-1	This vaccine has not been tested on immunocompromised Cancer patients, so my husband‚Äôs oncologist advises against taking it
0/0	This vaccine has not been tested on immunocompromised Cancer patients, so my husband‚Äôs oncologist advises against taking it @ this time

0/0	This vaccine is NOT SAFE. Don't believe the lies!
1/0	This vaccine is a death sentence. You would have to be a complete moron to get this death Jab! COVAIDS is a hoax. The people are awakening
0/0	This vaccine is a fucking joke. A failure. Period.
0/0	This vaccine is a prion bio weapon. I also think prion bio weapons are being developed in other countries are going to use them in the following years. Anyone that knows what misfolded prion proteins are knows the scary terrible neurodegenetaive diseases that the proteins cause.
0/0	This vaccine is a weapon of mass destruction portrayed as a cure for another weapon of mass destruction.
0/0	This vaccine is all about pharmaceutical companies trying to make money!
0/0/0	This vaccine is an mRNA which changes your DNA makes you GMO. Don't take this s***
0/0	This vaccine is another garbage
1/1	This vaccine is at least very effective in stopping anybody from getting seriously ill. At the end of the day thats all is required At the end the of the day we are in lockdown only because of NHS pressure . If the vaccine can ease that then its more than enough
0/0	This vaccine is causing a false sense of security.
0/0	This vaccine is dangerous, do not take them, do not make your children take them, you are better off without a vaccine
0/0	This vaccine is dangerous.
1/1	This vaccine is going to be game changer to the world even though it isn't as high an efficacy as the mRNA
1/1	This vaccine is life!! YOu have to get this shot for you and for the others
1/1	This vaccine is needed for the mankind to live
1	This vaccine is not a silver bullet, but it's great news. We will still need to wear masks and practice social distancing for a while.
0/0	This vaccine is not determine as the solution of covid19...
0/0	This vaccine is not tested enough to be safe!!
1/1	This vaccine is our solution and our only chance..!
0/0	This vaccine is poison.
0/0	This vaccine is probably where the zombies come from!
0/1	This vaccine is still being TRIALLED, there is no data to state if there are any long term problems, no data to prove its efficacy past a few months, and the biggest problem is that it is a brand new TYPE of vaccine, never been used on humans BEFORE. Understand peoples concerns!
1/1	This vaccine is such a breakthrough for science!
1/1	This vaccine is the same as for the common flu! Just take it folks!
0/0	This vaccine modifies some of your cells using synthetic RNA to make those cells produce a new protein. Long term effects of this are completely unknown, it is a brand new technique. Funnily most people won't eat GM food. So have you understood this and really thought it through.
0/0	This vaccine only took months...*months* to develop, not even a year. That's way too quick. Also, how do we know this isn't going to mess up someone's DNA? There's no transparency.
1/1	This vaccine seems very promising. I hope it works.
1/1	This vaccine should be mandatory those who don‚Äôt wish to have it should be fined or have to be in permanent lockdown simple really
0/0	This vaccine should have never been pushed out!
1/1	This vaccine sounds brilliant, a much better approach compared to growing more of a deadly virus and injecting it in a weakened state into people like we currently do.
1/1	This vaccine technology is possibly one of the biggest achievements of modern medicine. I think it's beautiful. I wish more people could see the wonder of it.
0/0	This vaccine thing it‚Äôs really crazy.
0/0	This vaccine was rushed, it's going to be unsafe handing out when it's only been about a year
0/0	This vaccine will alter your DNA wake up this is a depopulation event!!!!
0/0	This vaccine will alter your DNA. Don‚Äôt let the government put anything in your body. God gave you something called the immunity system. Give it what it needs such as elderberry and you‚Äôll be set.
0/0	This vaccine will be the end of us
0/0	This vaccine will create a new sub-species that the elite can easily control and harvest organs. The homo domesticated!
0/-1/0	This vaccine will cure the flu..just like the flu vaccine...oh but wait.....
0/0	This vaccine will either be a great triumph in responding to a pandemic, or a complete catastrophe or perhaps not even needed, nonetheless I'm not putting anything in my body until at least 10 years of research into this disease, the vaccine to test for its safety efficacy and is it really neccessary
0/0	This vaccine will kill more than corona
1/1	This vaccine works like birth control.
1/1	This vaccine works! Yes you can still get it the virus being vaxxed but the sickness is WAY LESS then not being vaxxed
0/0	This vaccine's efficacy data is all over the place. Do not trust it.
0/0	This vaccine..wouldn't take it at the moment, seems too much like an experiment, could be unknown side effects and I'm not willing to explore those unless I really need to in order to travel for something very important and vaccination is mandatory.
0/0	This vaccinse is useless , ,,VERY DENGEROUS FOR EVERYBODY ,IF THEY WIIL NOT KILL YOU THE SAME DAY ,,,THEY KILL YOU LATER ....
0/0	This vacsine is a trap i ant taken it never. Been sick heard atack spose to help us
0/0	This vax is a fraud!
0/0	This vaxx is in clinical trial stage until 2023. The very act of taking it you participate in a clinical trial. Emergency powers had to be passed to allow the rollout. That isn't the case in the examples you cite.Previous vaxx have been properly tested & approved over many years
0/0	This very Vaccines will reduce half of the world population. Me and my family won't entertain this God forsaken act.
1/1	This video has only convinced me Pfizer is in fact much more effective. Thanks Vox
0/-1	This video is for Capital, not meant to inform people.
0/0	This video made me want to not get it more lol
0/0	This video said absolutely nothing about the side effects.....what a waste of time.
1/1	This video somehow helps me change my mind. I honestly was scared and doubtfull about the vaccine but now I'm feeling pretty much secure about taking it...üòå
0/0/0/0	This video was excellent, it‚Äôs told me that I‚Äôve made the right choice on not getting the vaccine. Thank you for this :)
0/-1	This videos is AWSOOOOOOOME !!! Thanks guys. Got my daily dose of propaganda.
1/1	This virus can be stopped only with the vaccine
0/0	This virus is hurting 2% of the U.S. population. The flu also hurts people every year. People with weak immune systems should probably rethink getting the vaccine because of the virus strand. They should probably isolate all together until the epidemic is over if they want to make sure they live. They could also wait until their bodies are in better shape and then think of getting the virus.
1/1	This virus was already known thats why they were able to develop a vaccine, trust the science!
1/1	This virus will decimate your immune system without the vaccine. That is the point in the vaccine my friend. It prepares you. Look at the vaccine trials. Every vaccine prevented death in 100% of cases. That‚Äôs no typo! Yes 100%.
1/-1	This warms my heart
0/1	This was ALWAYS the endgame for the antivaccine movement, to eliminate ALL vaccine mandates, including school vaccine mandates, in every state. I‚Äôve been saying this for years, and I always knew eliminating #CovidVaccine mandates would not be the end.
1/1	This was a very informative video. I knew that the COVID-19 vaccines were mRNA, but I never truly understood how they worked. Thank you for enlightening me TedEd in a beautiful and well-explained video.
1/-1	This was a well done video and great discussion. Along with washing our hands, using hand sanitizers, wearing masks, social distancing, getting vaccinated etc we should also focus on living a healthy lifestyle such as drinking enough water, eating a healthy and balance diet, get plenty of exercise, lowering stress and anxiety levels etc.
0/0	This was all a ‚ÄúConspiracy Theory‚Äù about a year ago
1/1	This was easy and simple. Please get your vaccine when you can & if your eligible.
1/1	This was excellent. Shared and hoping the vaccine skeptics I know watch it.
1/1	This was great - thanks for uploading. Would love to see a simplified breakdown of the components and mechanisms of all the vaccines currently (and soon to be) in distribution worldwide. I think once people understand what's going on inside the vaccines, it would help quell any underlying fears they might have.
1/1	This was great, I cannot wait for this pandemic to end and we can go back to normal, def taking whatever is offered to me!
1/1	This was helpful. I'm so tired of the anti-vaxxers out in full force, protesting in the streets!
1/1	This was how my mom was, but once they got to her school (she‚Äôs a para) she signed up.
0/0	This was just a conspiracy theory some days ago (Certificate Of Vaccination IDentity) but now we clearly know the whole thing was to force the vaccine in peoples and later chip them to achieve the NWO evil agenda....
1	This was my reasoning when I got the AstraZeneca jab, even though I'm in my early 30s. Yes, there seem to be some risks. And of course there are unknown long-term risks. But the risks of the virus seem greater than the risk of the vaccine.
0/0	This was never about health n safety. Its about $$$ and control
1/1	This was really very informative and we are getting our family vaccinated after watching this video . Also I would get vaccinated from private hospitals, lost faith on government processes.
0/-1	This was so fair and unbiased, I feel like people on either side of vaccine arguments would benefit from hearing this. It gives me a lot to think about. I wish the news and medical community in the US (and elsewhere) could be as unbiased. And that pharmaceutical companies didn‚Äôt have so much control.
1/1	This was so valuable!! Thank you for this.
1/-1	This was straight forward and helped ease my fears.
1/1/-1/-1	This was straight forward and helped ease my fears. Thank you Dr Strong
1/1	This was straight forward and helped ease my fears. Thank you Dr Strongüëçüèæüíô
0/0/0	This was the only vaccine I was interested in because of no bad news. Now I'm not going to get any of the vaccines. All have been tainted and have had adverse reactions to people. I'd rather take my chances with the COVID.
1/1	This was very convincing. I m waiting for m turn for vaccination
1/-1	This was very helpful, thank you!
1/-1	This was very informative. I was very curious about this vaccine and a lot of my questions are answered. Thank you.
1	This week, I received the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine
0/0	This whole COVID-19 IS BS why we don't hear about the flu or any other deadly diseases anymore ALL ILLNESS ARE CONSIDERED COVID19 AND PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM HOSPITALS they will kill you faster than a trigger happy police Bill Gates said years ago they are looking for a vaccine to control the world population NWO-NEW WORLD ORDER I just believe all this is for a greater plain of corruption handed down by all countries there is no vaccine for stupid
0/0	This whole comment section is filled with pro vax bots. Why is it so many getting mad at siaka for his opinions and on the other side praising the doctor, Nurse, and Teacher?
0/-1	This whole excercise has been handled appallingly (and late) by all governments and the various rushed-through vaccines represent blatant profiteering with no risk to the manufacturers. In addition, there are so many other disturbing and deliberately hidden stats including the huge amount of medical suffering endured by those who haven't been able to access 'normal' treatment.
0/0	This whole rushed process of less than one year development makes me question the legitimacy of the COVID-19 vaccine specifically. Not vaccines in general.
0/0	This whole thing in Russia was planned to implant microchips in their shots to track people. Not for the Virus itself. Russia... what can I say
0/-1	This whole thing is disgusting the vaccine is a scam. If they really wanted to stop this so call SARS 2 virus they would come up with something to stop it from getting into the cell
0/0	This whole thing is disgusting the vaccine is a scam. If they really wanted to stop this so call SARS 2 virus they would come up with something to stop it from getting into the cell, I hear Zinc, HCQ, VIT C and VIT D works very well. But instead this vaccine is a synthetic piece of the Virus protein put in a fat lipid so it can cross the cell membrane and GO INSIDE THE CELL. Makes no Fu(%ing sense. This virus should not be placed into our cellular structure it should be blocked from getting into the cell. The real Pandemic is how stupid people are.
0/-1	This whole thing is shrouded in corruption beyond belief
0/0	This whole thing sounds sick and disturbing, you're basically forcing people to take an experimental drug and no one is liable for any damages that this experimental drug causes... Is any of this sound right to anyone?
1/1	This will be burried in the comments, but I just got the vaccine the night before and feel awful. But I know science and my body are doing this on purpose and this video made me feel a lot better üíô
0/-1	This will be looked back on 20 years from now as a sick experiment
0/0	This will hurt us in the end. The longer it spreads the more chance of variants emerging. Thus u doing all the progress.
1/1	This will save lives, and help the economy
0/0	This would mean you‚Äôve isolated the virus, why don‚Äôt you show evidence of this or, well any virus existing?
1/1	This wouldn't be so bad if I could actually get the vaccine. I'm last in line.
1/1	This! I can relate to that. Isn't it important to know side effects and know what to do with them? The vaccine is a safer option most of the times but side effects may happen with everyone
1/0	This, and the DNA vaccines, create a platform that can be adapted to many other viruses in the future. Instead of a whole new vaccine being made, we can just take the sequence that codes for the sars-cov-2 spike protein, and swap it with a sequence that codes an important target of the next virus that threatens us.
0/-1	Thomas jefferson: "If a law is unjust, a man is not only right to disobey it, he is obligated to do so."
1/1	Those anti vax nut cases at it again!
1/1	Those anti-vaxxiners think the rest of us are sheep but they tend to be the real MONKEYS!!..
1/-1	Those are the same 46% who thinks chocolate milks come from the brown cow
1/0	Those arguing that the fully vaccinated must wear masks and socially distance are the true anti-vaxxers, insinuating that vaccines do not work well. Surprising that the media spreads such anti-vaccine propaganda.
1/1	Those at risk from previously eliminated disease (eg Infants, Elderley and those with suppressed immune systems) are at risk of death - and the Anti-Vaxx movement are complicit in this for weakening our species' herd immunity.
0/0	Those in power seem to think we would believe every thing that comes out of there mouths .
0/0	Those injections are crap, home remedies are far better and won't kill you
1/1	Those not getting a vaccine, those not following public health orders and guidance, those trying to discredit science, those are the folks we have to thank for this never-ending pandemic.
1/1	Those of us living through COVID will see more people dying year after year and more people being disabled by Long COVID year after year. Hopefully, when we die COVID and Long COVID dies with us. I pray future generations will develop immunity to COVID.
0/0	Those of us who refuse this poison have been vindicated.
1/1	Those of you saying you won‚Äôt take the vaccine because ‚Äúyou do not believe it is safe‚Äù: get over yourself. Your beliefs do not override science and reality. Based on what we are seeing so far, the vaccine is safe. Granted, nothing in life is a 100 percent guaranteed, yet, those refusing to take the vaccine right now not because of reality-based evidence but because of some stupid ‚Äúbelief‚Äù, seriously?
0/-1	Those plastic partitions make me laugh, like they will stop the virus from traveling across the room, give me a break!
0/0	Those poor children. Wake up parents!
1/1	Those rejecting the vaccine because they claim to have been "born free" simply do not understand government. We have to pay taxes bitch, none of us are free
1/1	Those saying they won't take it are the ones complaining we didn't have summer this year and the same will be for next year. Well done.
1/1	Those side effects look fine compared to the risk of my lungs being destroyed
1/1	Those side effects mean it's working. You're getting an immune system response as your immune system adapts to the newly introduced virus. It's worth feeling a bit crap for a day or two rather than having full blown diseases. I always have reactions to the flu jab, still get them every year
0/0	Those that have taken the vaccine are all just part of a huge experiment. Thank you guinea pigs. Let‚Äôs see what happen in the next year.
1/0	Those that want it WILL get it those that do not can roll over and die.
0/0	Those that wanted to be first in line to get the #CovidVaccine especially seniors thought their lives would go back to normal. I tried telling them they were naive to think that. I guess I was right.
0/0	Those that will take the vaccine they are already dead stop trusting this shiiit vaccine rely on The lord for This solution any mere man cannot help the world
1/1	Those vaccinated are less likely to be infected therefore less likely to spread the virus.
0/0	Those vaccines aren‚Äôt safe and anybody worth their salt will avoid them. I live in U.K. and recently I‚Äôve had 14 friends take the Vaccine...............now dead. One just 45 minutes after the shot.
1/1	Those vaccines had the virus. Most of their danger was it could give you the disease because of this but were usually still better than getting the disease naturally. The first small pox vaccine was deadly but it was way better than a 60% fatality rate of getting small pox naturally. This vaccine and the next one do not contain the virus at all. Looking back on that is like saying I hope this banana doesn't taste like Apple because the last fruit I got did. It's biggest risk it does nothing for you or you have allergic reaction to its ingredients (not to the mRNA) which is something people allergies to vaccines will have to wait till it's studied more.
0/0	Those vaccines have NEVER been classed as safe for humans ..its a lie and the most dangerous experiment on humans ever in the history of Earth. They are not called vaccines by the makers called gene therapy !!!!!!!!!
0/0	Those vaccines will be used on the new lab animals called human children.
1/1	Those weekly test should be at the expense of the unvaccinated, not taxpayer dollars.
1/1	Those who are not interested in taking vaccination should be kept in quarantine until the nation hit zero number of cases.
1	Those who choose not to take the vaccine should go to the end of queue when waiting to be admitted to hospitial
1/1	Those who don't believe in Science must stay inside their caves.
1/1	Those who don't believe in science, and think only God can make them sick or cure, are better off dead.
0	Those who get the poison are the experiment group; those who don‚Äôt are the control group. I‚Äôm staying in the control group.
0/0	Those who made your vaccine have no regard for human life and no intention to ever get rid the world of covid which was created in a lab, convenient right?
1/1	Those who refuse the vaccine should walk around with a hat with a bell on it.
1/1	Those who refuse vaccination should be charged for medical treatment costs. It‚Äôs not fair to make taxpayers or insurance purchasers subsidize them.
0/0	Those who take mRNA vaccine are welcoming Cancer
0/0	Those who take the vaccine have to take it over with a boaster then an annual shot. Doesn't this resemble the Flu? Why would this last more years with you taking the vaccine? It makes no sense for this to carry on year after year. Go look up Covid Passport that has been planned since last May 2020. ID2020 is part of the Certificate of Vaccination ID. Have you heard about the Quantum Dot tattoo with Luciferase to track those who have the vaccine? Do you know about Patent 666 introduced in March 2020 which is a BG/Microsoft patent that will hook you up to the cloud with a Crypto Currency based on body activity. This CV passport sounds like the mark of the beast in the Bible.
1/1	Those who turn away from reliable knowledge, who wallow in conspiracy theories and lust after the next foolhardy, completely unsubstantiated claim, who find a home in absurd doomsday fantasies, will be difficult to reach.
1/1/0/1	Those who want the vaccine should take it.
0/0	Those who were fired due to Joe Biden‚Äôs illegal vaccine mandate should be offered their jobs back and receive back pay courtesy of the federal government.
1/1	Those who won‚Äôt have the vaccine need to justify their selfishness act in some way. Some of them convince themselves it‚Äôs bad; others want to think they‚Äôre somehow more clever than ‚Äúthe sheeple‚Äù because they‚Äôve taken a few vitamins.
1/1	Though DT and his cronies are doing a poor job in helping States get the vaccines out there it is happening! Get your vaccine when available!!!!!!! And wear your mask!
0/0	Thought those POSION death clot shots we‚Äôre supposed to provide ‚Äúultimate protection‚Äù according to fraud Fauci
0	Thousands flee Germany leaving thousands of hospital beds for the vaccinated. I hope the vaccinated are happy
1/1	Thousands have become disabled or have long term Covid symptoms there is no need to continue this trend. Please get vaccinated if not for you, than for those who are less able to protect themselves.
1/0	Thousands have died from Covid 19 after being vaccinated. All drugs can be dangerous. They must never be compulsory!!
1/1	Thousands more unvaxxed, obese Americans (mainly Trump voters) will die before the disease becomes endemic. That's why Trump himself upset his base by asking them all to get vaxxed. His voters are dying off.
0/0	Threaten me with prison time, millions in fines, suspend my driver license, etc: I wont even take a covid test. Go right ahead and experiment on the brainwashed, living in fear and the guinea pigs.
0/0/0	Three M.D.s I know very well, with much experience, have told me: "Do NOT get the vaccine."
0/0	Three months out from second Pfizer and still dealing with shortness of breath, fatigue, brain fog, heavy limbs, nausea.... side effects are real.... and no fun! I regret to have taken the shot
1/1	Three potential vaccines less than a year after the outbreak. Everyone talking about how we can‚Äôt stay locked down forever should‚Äôve just stfu and do what they were told. Much less people would‚Äôve died and we‚Äôre probably gonna be able to end the lockdown in the next 6 months or so
1/-1	Thrilled to had had the vaccination but the second dose of Pfizer hit me hard. I had no reaction to the first dose.

1/-1	Time to flex on these anti vaxxers by STAYING ALIVE
1/0	Time to get those tranq guns and vaccinate some fools
1/1	Time to listen to health care professionals instead of politicians and YouTube quacks.

1/0	Tin-foilers: "Lockdowns and mandatory masks infringe on muh rights!" Also tin-foilers: "The vaccine will put an end to all this? Try to jab me and see what happens, buddy!"
1/1	To Pfizer, this is far greater achievement than Viagra 2 decades ago. If it keeps being successful, those scientists deserve Nobel Prize!
1/1	To a person like me with a survival chance of around 0%, 89% immunity does sound pretty good.
0/0	To all my unvaxxed brethren out there: HOLD THE LINE!
0/0/0/0	To all my unvaxxed brethren out there: HOLD THE LINE!!!
1	To all of you antivaxxers, smokers, karens, etc. Keep doing the stuff that you are doing, eventually, those practices will get you killed and your stupidness will not pass on along through the generations! NATURAL SELECTION BABY!
1/1	To all people who are denying the vaccine: People like you are making the virus stay, killing more people, all because your hole covered brain doesn‚Äôt like vaccines. Please just take the vaccine or we will be doomed
0	To all that are saying ‚Äúunvaccinated people will go maskless and it is a risk to me, even though I‚Äôm masked and vaccinated:‚Äù what is your solution? Wear masks forever?
1/1	To all the people questioning the long term effects of these vaccines, despite the fact that they went through all the proper FDA clinical trials, did you have the same concern for hydroxychloroquine, which only had a few anecdotal cases to show its effectiveness?
0/0	To all those that vaccinated AND caught covid........ I'm unvaccinated and never had it.....

1/1	To antivaxxers: Say you are entitled and selfish and don't understand basic medical science without saying you are entitled and selfish and don't understand basic medical science
1/1	To any anti-vaxxers reading this, I don‚Äôt freaking care if you don‚Äôt vaccinate, ok? Just, vaccinate your kids. The fact that you think you know more than a profesional doctor or scientist with a carrer just because you saw it on Facebook is freaking disgusting. But most disgusting is risking your child‚Äôs life just because of that egoist thought. The murderer isn‚Äôt Bill Gates, doctors, scientists or the government, YOU are the murderer.
1/1	To anyone and everyone involved in the development of the vaccine...... Thank you.
1/1	To anyone worried about long term side effects: I really don't think there's any real mechanism to cause long term harm. As far as the mRNA itself, it's literally just strains of mRNA that code for (relatively inert) proteins. Our body uses mRNA to code for proteins all the time, so that isn't new. There's no virus involved at any point so there's no risk of infection.
1/1/1/1	To anyone worried about long term side effects: I really don't think there's any real mechanism to cause long term harm. As far as the mRNA itself, it's literally just strains of mRNA that code for (relatively inert) proteins. Our body uses mRNA to code for proteins all the time, so that isn't new. There's no virus involved at any point so there's no risk of infection. The technology is pretty good at replicating how viruses work, and that process itself isn't associated with any long term effects. There HAVE been mRNA vaccines before, specifically the one for Ebola - which I believe was in stage 3 trials and got an emergency use authorization. I'm pretty good at examining potential consequences, and really the only thing outside of normal immune reaction side effects I can think is an excessive inflammatory reaction related to the delivery mechanism.
1/1	To avoid the vaccines because of the small chance of side effects is like avoiding food due to the risk of getting salmonella. Yeah, the risk is there but the probability is low.
1/1	To be anti vaccine is akin to being anti life.
1	To be fair I used to be skeptic of the vaccine, but I do believe now most people should grab it
0/0	To be honest.....im not going to take the covid vaccine.....
0/-1	To be pressured into this political population control is not good!
0/0	To be used as a test subject is crazy.No thank you.Ill wait a couple years down the road to see what it does to people.My masks have done just fine.
1/1	To be vaccinated is very good to every body So every body must try to get it
1/1/1/1/1	To be vaccinated is very good. Every one should get
1/1	To be vaccinated or not - this is no longer a private decision. The vaccination rate decides on the lives of thousands and on de facto lockdowns for millions.
1/1	To beat the pandemic here at home, we have to beat it everywhere. That‚Äôs why the U.S. is leading the world on vaccine donations. As of today, we‚Äôve shipped 400 million vaccines to countries around the world ‚Äî four times more free doses to the world than any other country.
1/1	To date, pregnant health care workers who received the vaccine are doing well.
0/0	To each his own. If you want you can get it. COVID19 has a 99% survival rate. I am not taking the vaccine for 3 simple reasons. 1. It will not prevent me from contracting COVID19 2. It will not prevent me from spreading COVID19 3. I am young, healthy and have no immunity or comorbidities issues
1/1	To everyone who's afraid of microchip tracking through vaccines, wait till you find out about cellphones and social security numbers.
1/1	To everyone who‚Äôs had their jab! Congrats from us at weird water colors.
0/0	To expect a vaccine developed in less than a year to actually be good is nothing short of stupidity and hubris.
0/0	To fight the virus naturally. Zinc, vitamin C, working out, social distancing. I literally do not leave my house. There is no one size fits all. U can literally tell who has the vaccine by how they talk on here. It's in u. So ur baised about anything bad said against it. #COVID19
1/1	To finally end this pandemic, we need to get vaccinated to achieve herd immunity. It doesn‚Äôt matter which vaccine, get it if it‚Äôs available.
1/-1	To get natural immunity, you would have to get COVID and survive COVID....It's been here for two years, why haven't we reached herd immunity by now?
1/1	To give context , the research on the polio vaccine was conducted on 1.3 million children and was approved in less than a year . 6.4 billion covid vaccines have been administered in over a year . Pretty heady research
1/1	To have all those new tools against the virus and to not use them just because of some rare sideffects is illogical to say the least.
0/0	To hell with VACCINE. Nobody needs such rubbish.
0/0	To hell with ur vaccine
1/1	To help keep your community healthy, get your #CovidVaccine when they tell you it‚Äôs your turn.
0	To many people have died from this vaccines that the media isn't talking about. I'm staying away from it
1/1	To me it doesn‚Äôt matter how one feels, if the people who are the experts in health services and epidemiology say that it is the recommended antidote to the Covid 19 disease and it is the best outcome for the society in which I live if as many as possible agree to have it, I bow to superior knowledge, authority and qualification.
1/1	To me it‚Äôs go as fast as possible but do it safely do it efficiently and make sure it works well but the day comes out and it‚Äôs safe and take a bowl and everything I will be in the lineup for that vaccine for coronavirus
1/-1	To me the entire situation reminds me when I was a kid . I thought I knew it all at 13 years of age and whatever my parents said I wanted to do the opposite. Why, because I felt I was an adult and my parents had no right . So I did a lot of foolish things . Everything my parents told me not to do I did . In my head I am an adult and I had free will to do what I want when I want . Fast forward ‚è©. It‚Äôs astonishing 30,40, 50, 60, 70 , 80, 90 year olds , have them same stupid concept I had as a child ?? Is it mental health ?
0/0	To me, natural antibodies are better than any man-made antibodies
1/1	To not Vaccinate is not an option.
1/1	To outpace the pandemic, everyone needs a vaccine. Until everyone is safe, no one is safe.
0/0	To parents do you know the vaccine is 100x more dangerous to children than covid? Do you know that if your child suffers an adverse reaction or worse your story will be buried by the media.
1/1	To prevent covid 19, put on a mask and ask others to wear it too. For the safety of yourself and your family, make sure to get a COVID vaccine
1/1	To protect our health, and promote the health and well-being of our communities. We have the moral duty to get vaccinated as soon as possible. The fight against COVID-19 depends on every one!
1/1	To protect the people who might die from covid as many as possible needs to take the vaccine.
0/-1	To prove the vaccine doesnt cause any harm takes years, not weeks or months. How about that?
1/-1	To quote Rogan in that video, anti-vaxxers are ‚Äúwhacko‚Äù. ‚ÄúParanoid and delusional‚Äù and ‚Äúthey want it all to be a conspiracy‚Äù. Pretty sad that those people he referred to in that way now look up to him and his misinformation is killing them.
1/1	To recover from the pandemic, we need a truly coordinated and collective commitment to equitable distribution of vaccines.
1/1	To save lives and stop the pandemic, we must protect the truth about vaccines.
0/0	To save you all 13 mins of your life I will tell you how it works, these companies throw some chemicals together, your insurance pays said manufacturer trillions of dollars for you to be a guinea pig. Nah I'm good
0/0	To show statistical significance for a virus of this type, a vaccine must show efficacy, (save lives) period. However, when the overall death rate is between 0.2 and 0.4 %, there will be little to no benefit. In other words, SARS-COV-2 virus is far too weak right now to show a vaccines effectiveness rate numerically, at population scale.
1/1	To stay safe every one should take vaccines. And follow the other rules.
0/0	To the all anti-vaxxers. You just haven‚Äôt been effected by it or see it to understand
1/1	To the all the wonderful scientists who worked on these vaccines. I thank you for all of your hard work and dedication. And to all the front line workers, lets pray that this nightmare will be over soon.
1/1	To the anti-vaxxers. A couple of allergic reactions isn‚Äôt equatable to the 1 in 1000 deaths we have already had in the UK.
0/0	To the people choosing to get the vaccine, good luck...
1/1	To the people who say "its only 94% effective". Would you not buy a lottery ticket if your chances of winning were 94%? Cmon now.
0/0	To the people who thought they were getting their lives back if they got the vaccine. You were listening to democrats. DEMOCRATS LIE .
1/1	To the point, reassuring and factual information delivered without wasting my time. Great video as usual. Thx alot for doing you guys do. Much appreciated ??
1/1	To the unvaccinated: Snap out of it, and effing man up! You are pathetic.
1/0	To the vaccinated: get your booster shot because the first two didn't work. To the unvaccinated: get your first two shots so you will be safe. HOW DO PEOPLE NOT SEE THIS. Twilight Zone
0/0	To those "believers" of these vaccines and have private medical insurances, try to get in touch with them and ask about compensations caused by the side effects. You'll see how deep the rabbit hole is...
1/1	To those still unvaccinated, is it worth potentially losing smell and taste permanently, or even 10k or more in hospital bills? Not everyone has million dollar contracts that can afford hospital bills like those.
1/1	To those who are ONLY looking at the NUMBER of COVID-19 cases to doubt vaccine effectiveness: Please ALSO look at hospitalisation rates, deaths, ICU occupancy and specifically number of Category 3, 4, and 5 cases, etc. Vaccines work. Vaccines save lives. Please get the booster.
1/-1	To those who are deep in conspiracy land, they will just use this as further evidence.
1/1	To those who have not been vaccinated yet: now is the time. Protect yourself and your family.
1/1	To those who think vaccines are poison, they have brains made of peas
1/1	To those without the vaccine? Darwin is laughing at you.
0/0	To vaccinate the world you need lots of brainwashing to someones and lots of threats or intimidations to others. Can not be done without these methods
1/1	Today Got first dose of COVID Vaccine, It is safe.
1/1	Today I also had a vaccine shot...So far everything seems good..

1/1	Today's PSA: Vaccines DON'T cause autism!!!!!! Spread the word, because apparently a lot of people are still confused!
1/1	Today's report of @Merck dropping their covid vaccine program d/t lack of adequate immune response tells us just how damn lucky we are to have such high efficacy vaccines so quickly
1/1	Today, I got the Moderna COVID vaccine.
1/1	Today, I‚Äôm a little extra thankful for science and modern medicine. Thankful for the brilliant, hardworking humans who made this happen. Thankful for another layer of safety to my patients. Thankful for a little glimpse of hope. We all got the vaccine!
1/1	Today, I‚Äôm fully vaccinated, and it feels great to be a part of something larger than myself again. #vaccinated
1/1	Todays civilization exists because of vaccines. No strong immune system will help you against COVID-19, Ebola or Malaria.
0/0/0	Todayshow needs to stop glorifying this vaccine, especially being that it is still in a clinical trial period and will be until 2023. Also, It has not been approved by the FDA, and It‚Äôs illegal to force people to take an experimental vaccine. #NoVaccine
1/1	Today‚Äôs sunrise is for my mum who gets her vaccination at 10.20. Putting your life on lockdown hold when you‚Äôre just shy of 80 is tough. And she smashed it. Full of love & pride for her & all this amazing generation.

1/1	Tomorrow im gettin my first dose of Pfizer .. very happy
1/1	Tomorrow is my 2 week full immunization day. Time to go lick some door knobs!
0/0	Tonight a friend of mine who took the shot was rushed to the hospital via ambulance with numbness in his tongue and lips with pain streaming down his arm. In North Carolina. He took the shot on Friday. It's Tuesday. And his family doesn't think the vaccine has anything to do with these symptoms. He had COVID. Kept the brain fog. Thank you for all you do to educate folks!
1/1	Tons of people that don't believe in the vaccine. Kinda sad to see how many people don't trust science anymore. Hopefully they at least wear a mask till all of us get the vaccine, or they just deal with getting something they don't believe in.
0/1	Tony Blair says it's 'inevitable in the end' regarding using #CommonPass for travel. The same person that said vaccination is the 'route to our liberty.' Not on our watch, Tony. We're just starting.
1/1	Too bad not all of the adults in America want the vaccine... I got my first Pfizer dose last Tuesday and most of my friends are skeptical and would rather wait a while longer before getting a vaccine that was ‚Äúquickly shit out‚Äù.. The disinformation is real in Louisiana...
1/1	Too bad the vaccine isn't experimental and there is enough data to prove it's safety. You're simply refusing to listen to facts.
0/0	Too bad they didn't do their research instead of taking their word for such a kill shot.
1/1	Too bad they would not put the same effort into getting vaccinated. We have something to help with covid and people are still complaining. The vaccine lessens the severity of covid and lockdowns and masks prevents death death an prevents ICU from being over run with covid.
0/0	Too bad this covid vaccine is more technology than vaccine, and is messing with our dna/rna and immune system, and is experimental (don't get me startedüò´)
0/0	Too bad you don't know if it helps stop the spread.

0/0	Took both the doses and still got severe covid I'm 32, These vaccines are frauds and doesn't work
1/0	Took it with no I‚Äôll effects at all.
1/1	Took mum to get her 1st Covid vaccine today. So happy for her after 10+ months of isolation. She finally has light at the end of the tunnel
1/1	Took my in-laws to get vaccinated yesterday. There was a small anti-vaxx protest by one door, w/ a few people carrying signs about how the vaccines contained mini-chips that were going to be used as tracking devices. Man, wait till those people find out about cell phones.
1/1	Took my second dose of the covid vaccine few days ago and I am fine. I am pro vaccine because yes I work in the ER at a hospital and I care about my family. I want to keep my daughter safe and I was not harmed by either vaccines.
1/1	Took some searching, but got an appointment for Saturday. I‚Äôve never been this excited about getting a shot in my life.

1/1	Took the vaccine, still feel fine.
0/0	Total BS. Vaccines are proven to cause serious harm to the immune system. AVOID!
0/0/0	Total nonsense!! The vaccin is already mutating... its a normal flu virus!! Its a plan of WEF!!! The world will be hel!
1/1	Total overreacting, clots are common in healthy people, can occur at anytime with no apparent reason.
1/1	Totally Agree. Every nation must have access to the vaccination and the third world countries need to be assisted to get them administered.
1/1	Totally agree. We discussed it on our village site and most people had some sort of reaction for a day or so e.g. shivers, headache, pain in arm. But all were delighted to receive the vaccine.
0/1	Totally bonkers taking it....oh they have also waivered off any rights of prosecution too.
1/1	Totally get a shot.
1/1	Totally going to get it.
1/0/1	Totally safe, zero side effects, 100% effective. Get in line now sheep!
1/1	Totally worth it so that we can reduce the spread and hopefully get closer to normal this year!
1/0	Tough talk for someone who can have their family wiped out by a rusty nail
1/1	Tq for the explanation doc. We need this much as media constantly scares us about death after taking the vaccines.
1/1	Trained doctor: "The side effects are one in a million" Internet mom: "no"
1/0	Trained doctor: "The side effects are one in a million" So there is no reason to not getting vaccinated
0/0	Training and certification so important before delivery this vaccines safe prevention firstly priority !
0	Translation: "People are starting to wake up. We have this narrow window of opportunity to deliver our lethal injections before the masses wake up. We have to do it while the people are still hypnotized. If necessary, we will increase our terrorizing, so the lethal injection will be offered as the solution to escape our terror".
0/0	Translation: We have found yet another way to encourage you fools to line up for our obscenely profitable snake oil!
0/0	Transparency would be saying these vaccines are still on trial phases and they were just approved under emergency frame
1/1	Treating vaccines like an issue of personal freedom instead of public health is the problem. By all means, inform parents about vaccines. But don‚Äôt give them the impression they have a choice. Vaccines save lives, and the lack of herd immunity is a public health crisis.
0/0	Trials? Are you kidding? Real trials go on for years.
0/-1	Triggering Article 16 was a big mistake and EU heads should roll. BTW there are 4 mutations of C-19 already so the vaccine(s) being "smuggled" will be a placebo for the next pandemic outbreak - they have an efficacy of 50% on the variants already. So within 5 months a new vaccine will be doing the rounds or not! The Dutch trying to sell pork to the Muslims or are you not confusing the Dutch customs officer confiscating the Brits ham sandwiches? - which caused an outrage and made headlines on 1 Jan 21! Recently migrants were rioting in the UK, and set fire to army barracks housing them as a protest of the C-19 outbreak in their camp - or was this just a spot of bother in your opinion?

1/1	Triple shot here. No regrets at all. I don‚Äôt care if you guys get a shot or not but I did. So did all my deep holler conservative family. We are all fine too.
1/1	Triple vaccinated and so grateful to be! I did it for myself, family and friends. I did it to hopefully not contribute to overburdening our healthcare workers who are overwhelmed.
1/1	Triple vaccinated, and when there is a Omicron vaccine update from Pfizer or Moderna, I‚Äôll take that too.
0/0	Trojan rubbers have a better % of safety.
1/1	Trolley problem. Smaller pile of bodies with the vaccines than without.
0/0	Trudeau and pro-vaccine people said they wanted to make life as difficult as possible for non-vaxers. They also angered those who felt forced to have their doses. These irresponsible idiots have sown the wind, now they will reap the social and political storm.
0/0	Trudeau hid the fact that he receives a commission every time Pfizer or Moderna vaccines are administered! Acuitas Therapeutics produces the lipid nanoparticle technology used in the Pfizer vaccine! The Trudeau Foundation owns 40% of Acuitas! And Macron?
1	True fact: Fully vaccinated people are less likely to develop long covid, have covid-19 for longer, less likely to require hospital treatment or be in the ICU, and so they are already helping to stop direct/indirect spread of covid-19 in many more ways than unvaccinated people.
0/0	True story - my daughter and I are the only members of my family unvaccinated. We are also the only ones that have not caught COVID that we are aware of.Several fully vaccinated and boosted family members have had it twice.
0/0	True story, person tests negative for ‚ÄúCovid‚Äù 3 times and is in good health. person receives vaccine and becomes seriously ill immediately. ALL with knowledge of this are worried and accept vaccine as the culprit. Medical professionals acknowledge vaccine reaction day/day after
1/1	True story: both my kids have tested positive. And they have also been close to me before they were tested. Both me and my husband have been vaccinated and boostered, and we both are still negative. It definitely works.
1/1	True this is for our protection from Covid19 virus. This is safe and very effective. It will help to prevent COVID 19, reduce its number and ultimately eliminate COVID pandemic.
1/1	True! My brother 65 got Covid and he has AFIB and is a big drinker. He is recovering. Could have been so much worse! Vaxxed and boosted saved him.
1/-1	Truly real world conditions! My sister is a fully-vaccinated nursing home health care worker. She was vaccinated in the first week. Her three teens, then her husband all came down with Covid about two weeks ago. The kids recovered, the husband is struggling, my sister is absolutely unscathed.

0/0	Trump isn't taking it yet, neither am i.
0/0/0/0	Trump said he won't take so I'm not taking it
0/0	Trust is hard to establish when the companies were given indemnity. Trust is hard to establish when the people pushing the vaccines will gain financially. Give insurance to the public. Let them share in the wealth generated from vaccines. SImple.

1/1	Trust the scientists: it‚Äôs safe.
0/1	Trust the vaccine citizen, you have no choice.
0/0	Trust your amazing immune system, don't take the jab.
0/0	Trust your common sense. Why would you take a untested vaccine for a virus that's 99.9% survivable and only inflicts the elderly with pre-existing health issues? Take supplements that strengthen your immune system, be active and eat right. Your natural immune system is stronger than any vaccine.
0/0	Trust your deepest intuition no matter how many people try to convince you otherwise. Why would you allow anyone to inject toxic chemicals into your body as a test subject when there has not been sufficient testing and it has not been proven safe?
1/1	Trusting Science is the best way to go I think, therefore I will take the vaccine.
0/0	Trusting pharmaceutical companies is like trusting the devil himself.
0/0	Trusting the Gates vaccine for the Gates virus is stupid.
0	Trusting the governments (shills and in the pockets of big pharma mafia) and big pharma tycoons is like playing russian roulette with a fully loaded revolver.https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?service=youtube&uilel=3&passive=true&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fsignin%3Faction_handle_signin%3Dtrue%26app%3Ddesktop%26hl%3Den%26next%3D%252Fwatch%253Fv%253D5CNc-9Zm90A&hl=en
0/0	Trusting this poisonous serum is like trusting the government. A really bad idea
0/0	Truth is we don‚Äôt yet know the long-term cost of the vaccines on the human body. There are worrying signs of inflammatory disease, the Pfizer / Moderna myocarditis in young people is already terrifying. Don‚Äôt rush to get your kids jabbed, doing nothing might turn out safer. Ball‚Äôs in the air..
0/0	Truth will prevail. It‚Äôs very hard to fully understand what is going on from the information that we receive. There are holes everywhere. We have to stay aware. Question everything and by all means don‚Äôt get in line to receive the vaccine first!!!!
0/0	Truth! When a company cannot be held liable don't take their product. Quit being so naive!
0/0	Truth. Vaccines crash your immune system. We need liposomal Vit C, D3, colloidal minerals (incl silver), organic non-GMO fresh fruits and vegetables.
0/0	Try Fruits and Vegetables instead of chemicals and injections!! That alternative is more safe and NO side effects!!
0/0	Try and force me to take that toxic poison, see what happens.
0/0	Try and force me, see what happens
1/1	Try not to be scared of the vaccine, it‚Äôs protecting you against something roughly 10,000 times more risky (Covid-19 disease).
1/0/0	Try to avoid the vaccine at all cost, because it‚Äôs not FDA approved and could be bad in the near future
0/0	Try to convince me ; like the DDT was harmless back then...
1/1	Try to remember that the entire goal of pandemic management is to keep the healthcare system from collapsing! That's just possible with vaccines
1/-1	Trying hard to convince the lot of us!
0/0	Trying so hard to sell this experiment. I‚Äôll take covid 100 times before this vaccine.
1/1	Trying to find a middle ground with anti-vaxxers is like taking out my brain and carefully slicing it in half.
0/0	Trying to hard to show that it's safe, it has cancer in it. Do not get this
1/1	Tucker I love you man but please for the love of god don‚Äôt stoke fear of vaccinations. They are safe and one of the greatest medical achievements of our lifetime.
0/0	Turn to Jesus Christ! Don't have this poison injected into you.
1/0	Turning the patient into the medicine factory is genius.
1/1	Turns out that these vaccines are as effective as the initial reports show, it is fantastic news. Hopefully their effectiveness will be long-lasting as well.
0/1	Turns out, sending unvaccinated kids into classrooms, leads to the spread of infectious disease. Also: 30-49 year-olds, sort your shit out. Vaccines don't contain 5G nanobots, go and get jabbed.
1/0	Twitter is responsible for helping the narrative move smoothly along. Pfizer vaccine good"
0/0	Two NHS staff suffer anaphylaxis after the Covid vaccine
1/1	Two Pfizer or Moderna vaccines HALVE the risk of getting 'long Covid' and DOUBLE the profits of Pfizer and Moderna, expert says
1/1	Two days ago, I took the Moderna vaccine - dose #1. Really glad that I did. Thank you
1/1/1/1	Two days post dose #2. Sore arm both times but nothing else!
0/0	Two different vaccines ? With one people are suffering adverse reactions with two they can die .
1/1	Two doses about 6 months ago and I have covid.. easy peasy, maybe one crappy day so far
1/1	Two fully vaccinated kiddos! Sad that a six-year-old and a ten-year-old have more courage than millions of cowardly and ignorant antivaxxers!
1/1	Two groups (especially in the elderly and immunocompromised) that are protected by herd immunity already with every other vaccine, like polio, seasonal flu, mumps, etc. If you ain't either of those, there's no excuse to not use the vaccine.

1/1	Two of the major vaccines have over 90% efficacy, which means that they will dramatically reduce the likelihood of infection.
1/1	Two other positives of the Oxford vaccine is that it should only need to be stored at 2c to 8c, and it costs just over ¬£2 per vaccine to produce, they are offering it to the UK and EU at cost price.

0/0	Two people died after getting the shot and some experience nasty effects in Botswana
0/0	Two people, my cousin wound up in the hospital, mid 40s, healthy weight, second jab put him down. My mother in law wound up in the ICU two weeks after second Pfizer jab, she now has heart issues that her new cardiologist insists couldn't possibly be from the vaccine.............despite her being extremely heart healthy her entire life, not obese and not hypertensive.
0/0	Two reasons: - I dont want state to force me to do medical procedures - if vaccines are working, it's dysgenic program. I want my race to be strong. We need evolutionary stressors
0/0	Two shots was enough thank you. You can stick the rest wherever you like, but not in my arm
1/1	Two things that never gets old 1) Making fun of anti-vaxxers 2) Their kids
0/0	Two vaccines is enough profit for pharma?
1/1	Two very effective vaccines. Maybe more to come. Very promising. 2021 might be the antidote to 2020
0/0	Two weeks after having the first Pfizer vaccine, my father was in hospital with his first ever heart attack.
0	Two weeks after having the first Pfizer vaccine, my father was in hospital with his first ever heart attack. He was told he had several blood clots in his heart. In the few weeks that followed, he had three more attacks.
0/0	Two weeks ago, my cousins ~30 year old teacher (woman) suddenly died roughly week after getting Oxford vaccine :-( I do not know the details...just that she was feeling bad. And people in school are shocked. I get that probability of something like that is estimated 1 in 1.388.888, but one is starting to second guessing Level of Risk, if something like that is hitting near home :-|
1/1	Two weeks out and fully vaccinated as of today!

0/0	Type 1 diabetic and I will not take vaccine. Nope not a guinea pig for anyone
0/-1	Type 3.... people who are afraid the vaccine was magically created too fast and it's not safe yet....
0/0	Typical government propoganda to try and coerce you into having the Special Sauce injected into you, Don't go to the devils table all they will hand you are there scraps
0/0	Typical socialist: he kills people with poor management of the virus, then kills more with poor management of the vax. Not unlike China's mismanagement of diseases that swept through Mao's China, after he'd had all of the doctors killed for being western educated‚Ä¶
1/1/1	U have always led with an example. So so proud of you Dr Nikita..

1/1/1	UK is vaccinating at a per capita rate equivalent to more than 2 million per day in the US. Hope we can get there soon.
1/1	UK single dose vaccination strategy works, great. I hope Europe can handle this pandemic better soon.
1/-1	UK studies found even the viruses that escape the immune system and are stronger against vaccines show a 100% reduction in transmission
1/1	UNICEF announced new a deal with Serum Institute of India to access 1.1 billion doses of AstraZeneca/Oxford and Novavax vaccines at approximately $3 per dose for the poorest countries.
0/-1	UNICEF is a tool...devil instrument for destroying lives.
0/0	UNICEF is the wing of yahudi. Do not believe in it. Why they participating in spreding fake corona vaccine.
0/0	UNICEF you are sickening! Mouthmasks, experimental injections... you need to be taken to court for crimes against humanity!
0/0	URGENT! No more vaccination pass obtained with an infection! Olivier V√©ran announced this evening that it will be necessary to have received at least one dose of vaccine and an infection to obtain the vaccine pass. It's becoming more and more clear, Pfizer runs this country!
0/0	US ARMY ARE HAVING SIDE EFFECTS - BUT THE VACCINES ARE SAFE?
1/1	US should release COVID vaccine patents so that other countries can manufacture vaccines as well, its the best way to be able to address the global vaccine shortage
1/-1	US: Pfizer has found the vaccine GERMANY: BioNtech has found the vaccine
1/0	USA ages 0-19: 771 883 Covid Deaths. 0 Vaccine Deaths. Mmmk
1/1	USA is lucky to have all those vaccines and can go into get vaccinated whenever they want. My country, you have to fight to get vaccinated cuz everyone wants it here. I had to stay up until 5am to make my vaccination appointment and im getting my second dose tmrw finally
1/0	Ubiquitous viruses are fought and defeated primarily by the T-Cell lymphocytes within our immune systems, Not from antibodies. The entire narrative that is being heavily perpetuated by the science community is False and they must fully understand this. (This is fundamental immunology, first term, first lesson, Chapter -1 "Steps leading through respiratory virus infection, to immunity").
1/1	Uganda has ordered 18 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine at $7/dose. Adding transportation cost, it will cost $17 to fully vaccinate one person with it, the govt said. The vaccine will be used for people above 50, those with underlying conditions and for essential workers.
1/1	Ugh I‚Äôm so pumped for the vaccine even though I despise getting stabbed by a needle
1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1	Ugh I‚Äôm so pumped for the vaccine even though I despise getting stabbed by a needle.
1/1	Ugh my hubs and I woke up Christmas morning sick, got tested thr next day and we were positive. We are both fully vaccinated & boosted and feel if we weren't this thing could have been a whole lot worse. So thankful!
0/0	Ugh! Scary. The Pfizer vaccine seems more lethal.
1/1	Ugh. I'm just as tired of this pandemic as everyone else. But it's never going to end if there are still anti vaxxers. THEY are the reason this keeps happening.
1/1	Ugh‚Ä¶ at this Point, just let them. Maybe there will be less stupidity in this country
1/1	Uh you can still get the flu when you get the flu shot so it‚Äôs the same idea. Vaccines don‚Äôt stop you from catching a virus, they prepare your body for when you get the virus so that you have antibodies, or a defense built up to it so that your chances of surviving are much higher. Vaccines also help us achieve herd immunity. Idk why everyone keeps asking this same question, check the other comments for more detailed answers.
0/0	Uh, I say No. Under no condition am I getting the shots. I have the antibodies but even before I got covid I still would never get it. Anyone under age 40 does not need it imo.
0/0	Uh, no thanks! I will not get the vaccine
0/0	Uhhhh, dude was caught by Project Veritas whistleblower describing his FEAR of the C1984 injection, telling his liberal fascist underlings to reconsider taking it, as ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know the effects of mRNA‚Äù on someone who wants to stay healthy! Why doesn‚Äôt anyone seem to be aware of this. HE WUSSED OUT LONG AGO, PEEPS!
0/0	Uhm, u can keep that crap.
0/0	Um also the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are both only available under an FDA EUA‚Äîemergency use authorization. Neither is generally FDA approved at this point.
1/1	Um, this vaccine will save many many people. Six had a possible reaction out of 6 million? That's not even an anomaly
0/0	Umm no thanks!! Natural immunity is better!!
0	Umm you can't thats why so many people are saying hell no. What's it going to so to your body in 10 years or so???
1/1	Umm, because I‚Äôm not an idiot and I would like to live some more? I can never understand the logic that ‚Äòanti-vaxxers‚Äô apply when saying nonsense against vaccination. It‚Äôs as simple as this: If you want to live and if you don‚Äôt want to be a source for other people to get sick, GET THE VACCINE! Stop being delusional it‚Äôs high time and get the Covid-19 vaccine. Please.
0/0	Ummm no the data doesn‚Äôt show that. It‚Äôs shows that people who GOT COVID are most protected
1/1	Ummm. As pro-vaccine as I am...your statement that its "not clear" if its someone's basic right to refuse a vaccine is troublesome. I understand how important immunizations are and I am up to date with all of mine, I know about all the science and how anti-vaccination movements have seen a rise in almost extinct diseases, HOWEVER, insinuating heavily that someone doesn't have a right to decide what is put in their body is very telling. YES, there are at risk populations who would benefit from everyone being vaccinated...but I AM part of that population and I STILL believe it is an individual's right to decide what they do with their body.
1/0	Ummm... has nobody noticed the crazy drops in case rates and deaths that started as soon as the vaccines began being distributed?
0/0	Unapproved experimental gene therapy(falsely called a vaccine) ,causing problems? How is that possible? We trust our Governments, right?
0/0	Unbelievable how many brainwashed people there are. Wow, your son reduced his chance of dying (and even long Covid) from almost 0 to almost 0. Great job!
0/0	Unbelievable what lengths the governments will go to cover up the effects of the deadly jab. It's going to be murder on a grand scale.
0/0	Unbelievable! Most have probably already had it....vacinne doesn't keep them from getting it...
0/-1	Unbelievable, the covidists even deny the official site of the Drees which clearly shows a negative effectiveness of the vaccine in the 0-19 years old over 1 year. I think these people are crazy. They answer me with press articles.
0/0	Unbelievable....... There was no Research We are now the Research Now What
0/0	Uncertainties exist concerning the transmission post vaccination, and yes, the long term effects although expertly addressed in your video. The general narrative on the ground is that despite the clinical trials prior to release, the covid vaccine(s) remain largely experimental.
1/1	Under 10% of new cases are fully vaccinated.
1/-1	Undermining confidence... welcome to Orwellian truth speak üòÑ
0/-1	Understand that many, if not most, of the people in the comments on these videos who endorse the ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù aren‚Äôt just ignorant, foolish, and/or uninformed. They get paid to counter rational thinking by the same people who give the MSM their mindless scripts. It‚Äôs tempting, but don‚Äôt waste your time responding to them; it just makes them more money.
1	Understand the stigma surrounding anti-vaxxers and their views on autism. There has been zero reported links between vaccination and autism but there have been hundreds of thousands of deaths linked to a lack of vaccination.
1	Uneducated person to doctor: ‚ÄòYou dont know what you‚Äôre talking about‚Äù
0/0	Unfortunate. As those of you who have been vaccinated you're shedding and being tracked. Also, according to Pfizers own document those who are unvaccinated should stay away from those who are vaccinated(trial study patients). It's a 146 page document you will find what you're looking for on pages 65-69. Stay fearless and brave out here.
0/0	Unfortunately I have 2 friends fully vaccinated and boosted on ventilators and dying right now. So getting vaccinated did nothing for them.
1/1	Unfortunately I managed to evade the plague for years but not anymore! After a few days of a hellish fever that felt like it was boiling my brain in its own juices I tested positive for covid. Thanks to the vaccine it just feels like the nastiest flu ever.
1/0	Unfortunately I'd say about 25% of Americans will refuse the vaccination.
1/1	Unfortunately doctors and nurses are not over covid because the unvaccinated insist on running to the hospital when they get short on breath and then tie up resources there.
1/1	Unfortunately it dosnt matter what facts you put in front of them or what you say the anti - covid and anti- covid vaccers they will not change their mind until either them or a close loved one is hit with it and become very ill or die, such a pity pride gets in their way. I Will cross my fingers for all of them & hope and pray they or their families never get infected with this sly & very dangerous virus, as luck is what they will need in bucket loads.
1/1	Unfortunately it seems like they've hit a shortage. My state is rescheduling a lot of appointments because we just aren't getting what was promised in.
1/0	Unfortunately it seems that many people in the same position as this man are being ignored by their doctors and being told they are imagining things.
1/1	Unfortunately many news outlets have been using deaths in individuals who got the vaccine as click bait headlines. I would say you should read the article to see if the CAUSE OF DEATH of due to the COVID vaccine. Most of the time, the articles talk about someone who died and recently got the COVID vaccine, but that doesn't mean the person died FROM the vaccine and it's side effects. For example, someone could get the vaccine and then die in a car crash 2 mins later. It doesn't mean that the vaccine caused their death.
1/0/0	Unfortunately people will read this headline and think that this exonerates AZ. The choice isn't between Covid and AZ, but between AZ and other vaccines. It's not like I'm gonna purposely inject myself with the virus.
1/1	Unfortunately there are too many anti vaxxers so i doubt the whole world can be vaccinated
1/-1	Unfortunately there is no vaccine for what appears to be 2019's greatest disease: Stupidity.
1/1	Unfortunately we don't have vaccines and may not until 2023, because all of the developing nations literally can't afford the vaccines.
0/-1	Unfortunately, I think a lot of people are also on the fence. They are skeptical because it came out so fast, but they also miss their old life pre pandemic.
0/0	Unfortunately, people who take the vaccine aren‚Äôt gonna live very long.
1/1	Unfortunately, some people haven't enough of confident to take covid vaccine while some of theme are willingly to accept it just for the security. In my opinion, i would allowing myself to accept covid vaccine completely just to be secured from sickness!
1/1	Unfortunately, there are tons of police with the same mindset. Covid was the biggest cop killer last year but they still fight vaccines
0/0	Unknown long term safety data means she doesn‚Äôt know how the jibby jab will affect her body in years to come

0/0	Unless I am physically restrained and literally force to be injected with this garbage then I will never take it.
0/0	Unless it's mandatory I won't have the vaccination as I have I'm not sure from reading all the answers here it will be worth it, also I no one has even considered what the side effects might from having this vaccine.
0/0	Unless you are deaf and blind There is no way you haven't seen Or heard anything about the plandemic and vaccine reactions So why are you getting the jab???
0/0	Unless you're in a at risk group or over 60 you're more likely to have a higher risk from the vaccine then covid 19 Remember the problems with previously rushed vaccines Total Misinformation by the creator

1/1	Unpopular opinion. We need to increase vaccines to these less fortunate countries. If it takes longer to vaccinate these areas covid has more chances to mutate and make the people vaccinated less safe
1/0	Unsure about taking the #CovidVaccine Do it for this gentleman. R.I.P you beautiful young man Red heartRed heart
0/0	Unsure about the safety.
1/1	Unsurprisingly, the health risks of vaccination are lower than those of #COVID19 infection. https://ox.ac.uk/news/2021-04-15-risk-rare-blood-clotting-higher-covid-19-vaccines‚Ä¶. I'll take the any of the @GovCanHealth approved vaccines as soon as one is offered to me.
0/0	Untested, unlicensed, no possibility of informed consent, unnecessary (ACDP declared covid no more dangerous than flu in March), DNA-modifying. Coerced experimental vaccines are illegal (Nuremberg code). This is fascism. Evil.
0/-1	Until it gets approved by the FDA I have no reason to not trust it. Otherwise this is just a ruse.
0/0	Until its proven theres no side effects years later there should rightfully be doubt.

0/0	Until the government forces the needle in my arm without my consent, I‚Äôm not volunteering myself for guinea pig testing
0/0	Until the public has concrete proof what is in the vaccine ,i feel no one should take it. I hear that dead fetus matter is put into these vaccines,why?,and why on earth are heavy metals in there?,this raises great concern !. My impression of a vaccine is small dose of the virus . The rise in allergies and Autism has boomed from something,i will follow all laws ,but not a law that is putting harmfull substances into my body .There are natural organic ways to fight viruses.
0	Until these people show me a study of the long-term effects on women that plan to get pregnant, women that are pregnant, women that took it while pregnant, and their babies. I am not taking it, I'm a germ-a-phobe anyways. I will keep taking precautions.
0/0/0/0/0/0	Until they know the long term effects, I‚Äôll steer clear.

1/1	Use common sense. You are smarter than a virus. Outside your home: 1 Always wear a mask. After three days get a fresh one. 2 Wash you hands every 30 minutes, if unable then as often as you can. 3 Get vaccinated when available. It gives your natural immune system a head start. sterilisehours

1/1	VACCINATED! I know that the controversy between getting vaccinated or not is big. However, after being someone who was hit by COVID for almost 20 days with serious symptoms despite my athletic conditions and my healthy lifestyle was not an impediment for the virus to hit me hard, fortunately no hospital was necessary and for that reason It is my decision to get vaccinated. I DO NOT want to go through the same thing again or walk in fear as we all are, thinking that if COVID hits me again it could be worse this time. I am also part of this world where all of us are, in my opinion we must cooperate to stop the spread and be able to return to live freely.

0/0	Vaccination advocates don't seem to fully understand that. There is no such thing as risk-free. Everything has a risk, even water. And then they are bombarded with "risk free" which of course makes them suspicious.
0/0	Vaccination after COVID19 is pointless. Natural Immunity will always beat vaccination.
1/1	Vaccination against COVID-19 is not a lifestyle or religious convictions choice. It‚Äôs a matter of public health that crosses the normal sanctity of the skin boundary in the interest of the whole population. Ignorance, stupidity, and mis/disinformation is not acceptable as a basis for rejecting, say, licensing for driving or practicing medicine. You cannot be treated as a conscientious objector when your abstinence places the safety of countless others at grave risk. You WILL be vaccinated or else ... That‚Äôs my take and I‚Äôm sticking to it! If we don‚Äôt resolve this matter now we‚Äôll eventually pay more dearly when the next pandemic, perhaps far more lethal, comes along. And it will.
0/1	Vaccination basically means guaranteed casket when #second and #thirdwave arrive.
1/1/1/1/1	Vaccination campaigns and publicity will likely increase that number, i believe. Importantly, politicians and public figures must be out there promoting vaccination as soon as it's available - antivax morons already have a head start

1/1	Vaccination of as many people as possible is absolutely crucial.

0/0	Vaccinations in Israel began 49 days ago. Second doses began 28 days ago. People at high risk were prioritized. Nearly the entire elderly population received a second dose more than two weeks ago. So why are serious cases higher now than early January?
1/1	Vaccinations not only protect your child from deadly diseases, such as polio, tetanus, and diphtheria, but they also keep other children safe by eliminating or greatly decreasing dangerous diseases that used to spread from child to child.
0/0	Vaccinations on this scale are unprecedented and could actually promote mutations and thus variants that re-infect you because your immune response is ineffective even if you have had a vaccine or previous infections
1/1	Vaccinations save life and takes us out of this pandemic
0/1	Vaccinations take effect within days to weeks or not at all. There has never been and is not a single vaccination with a side effect that only occurs years later. This would also be difficult to explain theoretically. Vaccines will soon be phased out, and once they're gone, there's nothing they can do.
1/1	Vaccinations will keep the majority of people out of the hospitals. They are safe. Some will react to them as with anything. Some react to certain foods too. Is all good bad? I know I can still get COVID but not scared because of the vaccinations

1/1	Vaccine is safe 01 : 100000. This is negligible. And those who died after vaccination did not die directly due to vaccination but underlying diseases or conditions. If money is the lone idea of vaccinating people why should USA give free of cost to several countries. Why should India promise to vaccinate its citizens free of cost? Surely, the people with chronic non infectious diseases can be seriously affected by Corona. Those who are having communicable diseases will also suffer badly. Many elderly people have already died. The argument that I won't be affected as I am young and strong is a selfish one. They should remember that they may survive unscathed but they can be the reason for infecting and killing another vulnerable citizen when they test positive for Corona virus. It is in the interest of elderly people and fellow citizens of your own country all must be vaccinated.

1/1	Vaccine letter came today Fisted hand. Booked my 1st jab later this month & 2nd jab booked for May (automatically) Doing my bit to hopefully bring us all closer to normality
0/0	Vaccine like Microsoft Window. Full of nasty bugs that needs upgrading every year at your cost. Selling a flawed product under licence has made Gates the second wealthiest person on Earth
1/1	Vaccine makes you a winner. Dont be stupid. Be a winner. Get vaccinated.
1/1	Vaccine mandates are only needed because anti-vaxxers exist. The bad thing isn't the mandates. The bad thing is what makes the mandates necessary.
0/-1	Vaccine mandates are paralyzing the capital!
0/0	Vaccine mandates should never be legalised.
0/0	Vaccine manufacturers are exempt from liability! ! ! Think About THAT!
1/-1	Vaccine manufacturers are given protection because extremely rare (less than 1:1,000,000) side effects don‚Äôt outweigh the overall good that vaccines do but would bankrupt any pharmaceutical company that made them through civil suits
0/0/0/0/0/0	Vaccine manufacturers have ZERO LIABILITY
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	Vaccine manufacturers have ZERO LIABILITY In case of injury or death caused by vaccines
0/0/0/0	Vaccine manufactures having 0 liability for any type of harm means its 100% safe, got it.
1/1	Vaccine might be avaliable for kids under 5 by the end of this month. Get your kids vaccinated.
1/1	Vaccine more than 50 % efficiency is good ho have. Ekle it has 62 % efficiency and no deadly side effects
1/1	Vaccine needs to mandated those who are traveling, concert goer, technology co. hospital and-government employees, also private companies employees
0/0	Vaccine not approved by the FDA < Vaccine Approved by FDA, I have been double crossed by the people in charge of these companies far too many times, I will wait for the FDA to approve it.
0/1/0	Vaccine not necessary as less expensive alternatives showing excellent results, such as used on President Trump, are available. Also, I do not as low anything I Inected into my 80 year old, healthy body without personally researching contents. And nobody is talking about huge nu.bers of unreported death from the vaccines. In one Spanish village alone, previous to the vaccine had 10 deaths and when the vaccine was given, 79 people died from it specifically. I trust nothing rolled out this fast with no idea how long it is effective and long term effects.
0/0	Vaccine nothing more than a bio weapon.. Pray for those who got it.
0/0	Vaccine of death
0/0	Vaccine of death is a no from I.
0/0	Vaccine partners working together to fleece, drug and reduce the world population under the guise of health and safety.
0/0	Vaccine passports and mandates are nothing but a tactic to coerce people who haven‚Äôt already got their shot to go to get it.
1/1	Vaccine passports are a good idea. Among other things, it will single out the still large contingent of people who refuse vaccines, who will be foreclosed from doing a lot of things their peers can do. That should help break the resistance down.
0	Vaccine passports were ''conspiratorial thinking'' as well. Until that suddenly became, ''it is a neccessary measure''.
1/1	Vaccine preliminary results by the summer! This could be phenomenal news.
0/0	Vaccine remorse is real
0/0	Vaccine risk is rare until a bad outcome happens to you or someone you love or know. Same with covid. However, covid is inevitable and the vaccine is optional. It comes down to the personal choice which is slowly being denied in the erosion of freedom of liberty
1/1	Vaccine risk: Divide 6 adverse reactions by 6.8 million vaccines given: <0.00001 Covid risk: Divide 533, 857 confirmed deaths in U.S. by 28.35 million confirmed covid cases (March 30, 2020 to March 30, 2021) 0< 0.02
1/1	Vaccine safer than getting virus.
1/1	Vaccine seems to be such a big deal in some countries, like the US. Vaccine isn¬¥t such a big deal in Sweden, where I live. We get a lot of vaccines as kids like against the whooping couch, chicken-pox, tetanus, mumps, rubella and measles. Swedes also go abroad a lot, and then we get vaccines against hepatit a and b, cholera and Japanese encephalitis for instance, and other ones depending on the destination. In addition to that, in parts of Sweden there is a big risk to get tick-borne encephalitis, which is really serious, so a lot of Swedes get the vaccine against that. There is also a vaccine against shingles, but that is really expensive, so not many are taking that, but the health agency is discussing to perhaps subsidice that one, then I think a lot of people over 50 will get that one. And some also get the vaccine against the yearly flu, especially the elderly and vunerable. The flu vaccine lowers the risk of dying with 40 % in an cardiac arrest for instance. But there is also younger people who get it, just so they won¬¥t infect others, elderly and perhaps people who can¬¥t take vaccines. It¬¥s not a political thing here and I've never met a antivaxxer. I knew a few exist, but we don¬¥t have many religious nuts here in general, and people who believes in all kinds of mumbo jumbo and woo and conspiracy theories.
1/1	Vaccine should be available for all age groups. Vaccine wastage is a reality as many people are not aware enough to take the vaccine. Youth should be allowed too and 50-60 lakh/day vaccine must be administrated.
1/1	Vaccine should be mandated when appeals to take vaccines fall into deaf ears. You are only protecting your citizens and your healthcare system from being overwhelmed.
1/1	Vaccine side effects are minor and quite normal. Definitely, the benefits outweigh the side effects. ‚úî There is no reason not to take the vaccines. üíï
0/0	Vaccine that is not a vaccine, its not an inoculation at all. It is said to lower symptoms and not help keep you from getting it or spreading it, thats not a vaccine, thats a lie.

0/0	Vaccines are a dangerous alien scam. Please support my patreon.
0/0	Vaccines are a fucking joke and the virus just isn't going to go away on its own will.
1/1	Vaccines are a gamechanger, but only if they are available to everyone, everywhere. Our chances of coming out of the pandemic depend on how quickly and fairly #CovidVaccines are available to all people, in all countries, starting with the most vulnerable. #Vaccines4All.
1/1	Vaccines are a matter of public health. We are in a pandemic. Cut that "personal choice" "my body my choice" bs.
1/1	Vaccines are a public health thing, not a government control thing. People urging you to get vaccines are doctors and medical professionals, not politicians.
1/1	Vaccines are a tool, not a panacea. Missing from our approach to managing covid-19 are not just drugs but tests that are accurate, fast, simple to take, cheap, & plentiful. The fed‚Äôl govt needs to make the development/production of such tests a priority.
1/1	Vaccines are about 95% effective and this number shows a much higher effectiveness rate. I think it‚Äôs about 1% that have contracted the virus after being fully vaccinated. This is really good.
0/0	Vaccines are against God's plan.
1	Vaccines are almost too successful, I remember as a boy listening to my grandma talk about the world she grew up in before vaccines. She was always so grateful that vaccines were invented so that we didn't have to experience that

0/0	Vaccines are bad. I'm not vaccinating the kids
1/1	Vaccines are beautiful and I shed a tear after each of my three Covid ones.
0	Vaccines are biological weapons designed to make us perpetually sick, stupid and/or sterile. They are claimed to protect against "invisible" threats, the existence of which has never been proven.
1/1	Vaccines are certainly a lot less experimental then a novel virus. And why do all similar anti-vaxxers hang their hat on morgue figures as if that is the only possible long term complication from infection?
0/0	Vaccines are completely unnecessary and WRONG
1/1	Vaccines are cool, but I HATE NEEDLES, but I would get the vaccine
0/0	Vaccines are dangerous and will not prevent you from getting a flu or Covid. . If Vaccinations were safe and effective than why wouldn‚Äôt the manufacturers stand by their product and take full financial responsibility backing their product instead of Govt playing a part of relieving the manufacturers of any financial responsibility. Look at flu vaccines they never get the strain right each year and yet each year they are pushed and so many wait to get it Wake up people
0/0	Vaccines are dangerous tell your families and friends
0/0	Vaccines are dangerous, my child is fine and she hasn‚Äôt been vaccinated. Instead I use healing crystals
1/1	Vaccines are definitely necessary. Though, It is unfortunate that we are creating an industry where pharma can keep recommending top-ups/boosters. Seems financially convenient
1/1	Vaccines are developed through research and science. And if these people are rejecting science, I don't think they should waste further public resources by getting treated at hospital, because medical advancement is science and they rejected them.
1/1	Vaccines are doing their jobs though. Hospitalization and death among the vaccinated are extremely low
1/1	Vaccines are effective.
0/0	Vaccines are evil!! It's all about money and thinning out the population
0/0	Vaccines are evil. If you vaccinate, you will pay a hefty price later on. Might be even extra heavy price.
0/1	Vaccines are extremely good at providing long-lasting immunity‚Ä¶ to their manufacturers.
0	Vaccines are extremely important when they are a vaccine not an experimental gene therapy which is this case. A lot of people having adverse side effects do not report because they are dealing with aftermath or grieving the lost family members.
0/0	Vaccines are full of ingredients that are unnatural and dangerous. Theres a vaccine for everything these days,wheres the vaccine for Cancer/ Aids.....all planned. Ppl can see through the Bullshit Dont underestimate ppl that think for themselves.
1/1	Vaccines are giving us hope, which is why every life we lose now is even more tragic. We must take heart, take hope and take action.
0/0/0	Vaccines are going to kill millions
1/1	Vaccines are good for you. The benefit of getting it, outweighs the risk of the side effects. People have had really bad reactions from Them, that's true, but those side effects are very rare.
1/-1	Vaccines are good, but the medical industry is not to be trusted. Tough spot.
1/1	Vaccines are good.
0/1	Vaccines are great for growing immunity but natural infection is also great for generating immunity probably the better, the longevity remains to be same if the longevity is good the virus can be eradicated in the same time.
1/1	Vaccines are great.
1/1	Vaccines are helpful but natural immunity is much better.
1/1	Vaccines are here and I trust the doctors that suggest them. DONT listen to people withotutt knowlsdge to speak about the vaccines please!....
0/0	Vaccines are in direct violation of the Nuremberg Code
1/1	Vaccines are incredibly safe and have saved millions of lives over the years. Vaccines are one of the best scientific advances of our time. Taking a vaccine is like giving our cells a college course for finding and dismembering viruses. It‚Äôs truly genius.
0/0	Vaccines are just like cigarettes. We used to think cigarettes were really good for people and helped us. Then we realized how bad they are‚Ä¶ Maybe one day we will realize some stuff about vaccines too.
1/1	Vaccines are just updates to your body.
0/0	Vaccines are killing people. They will give you blood clots. They will fuck up your immune system. They are not designed to help you. They are designed to kill a portion of the population. This is worse than the Holocaust.
0/0	Vaccines are lethal.. Do not become a victim. Reptilians built vaccines. Dont use it
0/0	Vaccines are lethal... Do not become a victim.
0/0	Vaccines are like a poison funded by the government
1/1	Vaccines are like a training course for the immune system. They prepare the body to fight disease without exposing it to disease symptoms. When foreign invaders such as bacteria or viruses enter the body, immune cells called lymphocytes respond by producing antibodies, which are protein molecules. These antibodies fight the invader known as an antigen and protect against further infection.
1/1	Vaccines are like a workout for your immune system‚ù§Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
1/1	Vaccines are like bullet-resistant vest. It is not really bullet proof, but if I am a soldier I'd prefer wearing one.
0/0	Vaccines are litterally useless and cost taxpayers money
1/1	Vaccines are meant to attack the host, so your body's immune system learns to defend itself against the actual virus. This is why antivaxxers are a thing because they believe that big pharm and governments are trying to kill them, but fact is they're too uneducated
1/1	Vaccines are most effective with public saturation. We didn't need vaccine mandates to get rid of Smallpox because Americans at the time wholly embraced doing it as a civic duty. Smallpox is extinct, eradicated from the Earth. Some other countries, at the time of the global vaccination effort for Smallpox, did enact inoculation by force. America did not have to. These modern mandates are not even forcibly making people get them, though people act like they are. Too many of these people still want to act like petulant children with their benighted beliefs in junk science, while charlatans try to sell them snake oil alternative remedies.
1/0	Vaccines are not a 100% guarantee that you won‚Äôt get COVID. They greatly reduce your chance of getting COVID, or of spreading COVID. And if a vaccinated person gets COVID they probably won‚Äôt become severely sick or die. They also may be less effective against the new variants.
0/1	Vaccines are not coming to hurt you; grow a brain.
0/0	Vaccines are not mandatory. Encourage immune system defense with sunshine, fresh air (no mask), exercise, fresh fruits & veggies, supplemented Vitamin C/D/Zinc and proper rest.
1/1	Vaccines are not meant to stop transmission, vaccines simply keep you from dying. What is so hard to understand?
0/0	Vaccines are not much useful or effective on God "s pandemic (Covid 19).
0	Vaccines are not safe.
0	Vaccines are not safe. Covid-19 is no different. The coronavirus vaccines not only have aborted baby body cells within them, they turn a vaccinated person‚Äôs body into a kind of a nursery for viral super bugs that are vaccine resistant. They will shed from that person and become deadly, dangerous and potential killers for countless people. Dr. Bossche, who BTW is pro vaccinations, is warning the world for an immediate halt of global vaccination otherwise we are unleashing an unstoppable, uncontrollable monster, - a bioweapon of mass destruction. Dr. Bossche is saying covid19 vaccines are the wrong weapon. They are the wrong strategy that will lead to an uncontrollable monster.
0/0	Vaccines are not the best tool! Don't get vaccinated and don't get Boosted!
0/0	Vaccines are not the way out of lockdown but a Zero Covid Strategy...
0/0	Vaccines are not working good they are there for #Corrupt elite and #Corrupt biden family make corrupt money w pharma and vaccine companies
0/0	Vaccines are obviously dangerous. Every person who got vaccinated - died. Governments have to bury secretly half a billion people. Don't trust the government. Check your sources. I got all my information from facebook groups and whatsapp messages. I trust it way more than government and doctors. Be smart like me. I didn't finish high school, but I know more than all doctors and scientists in the world who say that we should get vaccinated.

0/-1	Vaccines can affect the nerves of the Brain interesting.. ü§î
1/1	Vaccines can also protect people who can't receive them
1/1	Vaccines can be controversial for many reasons, and this video talking about how they actually work brings up an idea that is not talked about as often. Because of how vaccines work, people sometimes view them as counterintuitive. Because vaccines work by injecting a person with a small amount of the disease, or diseases, they are being protected against, people question how it works. When people are injected with the vaccine, it is common to experience side effects such as coughing, sneezing, inflammation, and fever. These symptoms, which are most commonly associated with becoming sick, sometimes make people feel like the vaccine is doing the opposite of what it is supposed to be doing. They go in trying to protect their kid from getting sick, so they often wonder why their kid starts to show signs of developing a cold or flu. These symptoms can easily be explained by what they are doing. They are working to trap things like bacteria and get rid of them from the body. After that, adaptive immunity kicks in and programs the body to get rid of these types of bacteria if they are introduced to the body in the future. Though the process and symptoms may seem harmful to parents, they are actually helping the child. When children are vaccinated against diseases, they have the opportunity to live a healthier life.

1/1	Vaccines do cause severe side-effects, the thing is, THAT IS VERY VERY RARE, so it is worth taking the risk. Imagine you have to undergo a medical procedure to remove a tumor from your body, YES THERE ARE RISKS INVOLVED, but people usually take the risk! The thing with vaccines is, the risk is extremely low.
1/1	Vaccines do equal safety. 99% of people ending up in the ICU are unvaccinated. Those who get covid now are getting a strain that the vaccine wasn‚Äôt developed for, but it still provides SOME protection which leads to a milder (but still terrible) illness.
0/0/0/0	Vaccines do have side effects though. Moreover imunity against virus doesn't last more than 2 years
1/1	Vaccines do not even cause autism, though. The first time experience of getting them is disrupts routine and is an unpleasant sensory experience which makes previously-unnoticed autism obvious, but they do not trigger a massive rewiring of the brain, antivaxxers.
1/1	Vaccines do not have effects that come up 10 years later however viruses do. I personally got vaccinated as soon as I was able with no regrets. Each one of us who gets vaccinated brings us closer to ending this.
0/0	Vaccines do not make a person healthier. It‚Äôs the opposite, weakens your own immune system.
1/1	Vaccines do work. I suggest that everyone who is eligible for a COVID@vaccine should get one. I can tell you , I would not sacrifice my health or employment for freedumb.

0/0	Vaccines don't really stop infection, i got covid even tho I was vaxxed 2/3 weeks
1/0	Vaccines don't reduce the chance to spread the virus. Vaccinated people can spread the virus as well. Most people in hospitals with a positive PCR test turns out to be fully vaccinated people. Fact check it yourself.
1/1	Vaccines don't save people, vaccinations do. Let's all do our part to educate others!
1/1/1	Vaccines don't save people, vaccinations do. Let's all do our part to educate others! Here's a great video explaining mRNA vaccine technology. It is patently untrue when someone claims that the vaccine can infect you. People get jittery when they hear mRNA, but bear in mind, mRNA is just a derivative of DNA. Every living thing fundamentally relies on mRNA to exist. If the idea of receiving a novel vaccine makes you nervous, I reccomended you don't look up how little we know about COVID-19 infection long-term. We do know that other viral infections can cause lymphomas, sterility, cardiotoxicity, and many other problems long-term.
1/1	Vaccines don't take years to study Vaccines take years, normally, because they are incredibly time consuming to make and even more difficult to reach an acceptable efficacy. When you add in the stringent red tape of the FDA, this process takes a long time. These processes were given a freeway to approval for Covid. And with BILLIONS dumped into research and development by the government for these vaccines, it's perfectly reasonable why they were produced as quickly as they were. Pharma companies don't dump billions into vaccine research. Which is another reason why it normally takes years to make. There is a massive misconception of "not enough time to study, we don't know the long term effects". This statement is proof in itself that you literally don't know what you are talking about. For one, take the mRNA Moderna vaccine. The mRNA is the only active ingredient. Do you know what else makes up the rest of it? Salt, sugar, and lipids. All of which have been in your body thousands of times. The mRNA was proven completely safe as your body naturally breaks it down almost immediately. The number one severe side effect of vaccines is allergic reaction. This happens usually within 15-30 minutes. Most other side affects appear within a few days. After two weeks the chances of side effects are essentially zero. There is no "long term" side effects. That's an anti vaxxers stance and it's completely made up. In summary, vaccines take years to make not because they are worried about the long term side effects. But simply because of money, manpower, and red tape. All of which got a massive boost for Covid.

1/1	Vaccines help make covid less severe. Just like chicken pox, rubella, pneumonia, All those vaccines help your body build the protection, so you stay out of the hospital. They never said people wouldn‚Äôt get it,,,just wouldn‚Äôt get it as badly.
1/1	Vaccines help people develop immunity to a virus or other germ
1/1	Vaccines help reduce symptoms, lockdowns help slow the spread
1/1	Vaccines help to keep people healthy and ready for action. Armies need soldiers who are fit for training and combat and not going to fall sick on duty.

0	Vaccines that requires multiple shots to keep you from infecting other people that are taking vaccination shots. Kind of seems like "vaccination" may not be the right word for whatever they're giving people.
0/0	Vaccines usually take years to safely create. We do not know the long-term effects of the covid vaccine. Nor do we know the long-term effects of covid-19. The best thing we can do is try to stay healthy, and avoid anyone who might have had contact with the virus. I understand if older people get the vaccine, but what will happen to someone 20 years from now who are in their 20s and get it? We do not know the long-term effects of the vaccine.

0/0	Vaccines work but not the covid vaccine it's too quick too soon........
1/1	Vaccines work by training and preparing the body‚Äôs natural defences --- the immune system--- to recognize and fight off the viruses and bacteria they target. If the body is exposed to those disease-causing germs later, the body is immediately ready to destroy them, preventing illness.

0/0	Was that the one that killed the woman on live tv, or the one that paralysed the nurses face? I get them confused...
0/0	Was under the impression that two shots of phizer would keep me alive and out of the hospital. Why take a third if the effectiveness against catching covid wanes so quickly. even the vax makers are saying this. Unless I am incorrec, send my booster to COVAx.
0/0	Waste of time and money my kids will not be taking your snake oil
0/0	Watch as people start turning into zombies! One can hope!
0/-1	Watch out for the LONG TERM SIDE EFFECTS .Just because your younger doesn't mean your safe !!!
0/0	Watch ppl start dropping dead. It takes years to release a vaccine, the us government just shit this out there ass.
1/0	Watch some walking dead, it will help you get ready for whats to come
0/0/0	Watch the 70s movie "invasion of the body snatchers". Don't get the vaccine,stay human as long as possible
0/0/-1	Watching anything to do with vaccines never fails to make me cry!
0/0	Watching people pass out while getting the unproven vaccine was enough of a deterrent for me.
1/1	Watching provinces west of us cave to COVID. Distressing & frightening. Let's hold it together. Stay home if you can Wear a mask when outside Stay 2m apart Wash your hands Situational awareness Take any vaccine you are offered Contact tracing is difficult but working in Zone 4
0/0	Watching this did absolutely nothing to convince me to get vaccinated.
1/1	Watching this excellent and exciting virtual WHO COVID-19 Pandemic vaccination event today for 2021 and thank you so much United Nations!!
0/0/0	Wats the flipping point of vaccine if u still hav to wear mask and distance? Ppl dont follow these scare tactics
0/0	Way to early for taking any vaccines
1/1	Way to go Jamie. I am getting your vaccine!

1/1	Way to go! Boosters Rocks!!!!
1/1	Way to go, Nikki!!! I got my first shot of the Moderna vaccine 2 weeks ago. Can‚Äôt wait for the second shot.
1/1	Ways to increase vaccination? Offer extended hours, allow time off from work, make vaccines widely available in doctors' offices, get creative with mobile and non-traditional vaccination sites and provide transportation to them. Convenience overcomes reluctance.
0/0	We ALL KNOW where this is going. Tracking chips and bottom-line boosting ‚Äúbooster shots‚Äù every 6 months by Pfizer & Moderna.
1/1	We Vax because it's part of being a responsible member of our community, from a public health standpoint! On a more personal note, we vax for my nephew who had leukemia and who is unable to form his own antibodies, so our shots protect him, too.
0/0	We actually don't know its effects on the next several years, this really frightens me!
1/1	We agreed that the vaccine is safe first and effective
1/1	We all been waiting for this vaccine
1/1	We all got them shots the first opportunity we could
1/1	We all got vaccinated because we have children that can't get vaccinated and we need to protect them.
1/1	We all got vaccinated without hesitation. It did its job. Covid did hit my family but all minor cases. The vacciness worked.
1/1	We all have a duty to protect the most vulnerable in society. Getting a vaccine is literally one of the easiest ways to do that.
1/1	We all hope the vaccines do work, If they can stop hospitalised and deaths thats very positive. Great medical work being done which allow us to go back to normal so. ed at her than later.
1/1	We all know that the site pain side effects are a mixture of luck and the skill of whoever is using the needle
0/0	We all know the vaccine won't help anyone beat COVID.
1/1	We all need this reminder. It‚Äôs easy to become more relaxed with Covid fatigue but we must remain vigilant. Vaccines are coming, which is amazing, but buckle down for many more months of masks and distancing. Go walkies in woolies, stay safe and video chat regularly
1/-1	We all should be grateful for having a vaccine in record time but also be realistic about the risk that may come with it.
1/1	We all should get the vaccine. We need to live freely once again, be able to access and socialise with our loved ones once again.
1/1	We all should get this. We need to live freely once again, be able to access and socialise with our loved ones once again.
1/1/1	We all should vaccinate. Be kind to yourself and others.
1/1	We all understand to get vaccinated will save lives but some people are crazy and will believe any off the wall thing it just the way it is not getting vaccinated will put more people at risk I applaud your effort in trying to get crazy people to do the right thing
0/-1	We all want 2 go back 2 normal! We all don't wanna wear masks n social distance anymore!
1/0	We all want the vax 2 b 100 percent n have no side effects but every medication has side effects! It is what it is whether we like it or not
0/1	We all will die with or without taking the vaccine!
0/0	We all won't get the same programming with the vaccine! It depends on where you live which vaccine you'll get! The poor without a voice will be first to receive the cocktail of gene manipulation. Precursors or triggers for future steps in the agenda!!
0/0	We already have nature's vaccine
1/1	We already have wonder vaccines, and idiots still refuse to take them
1/1	We already know some variants will be more resistant, so far none are completely immune to the Pfizer.
0/0	We also don‚Äôt know yet if a person who got the vaccine can still spread coronavirus if they come in contact with it
0/0	We always knew there was the goal of a long-term money stream for big pharma.
1/1	We apparently must allow those around us to make poor decisions at the detriment of death of they and their family. My own brother; his wife, and kids, refuse to be vaccinated. I pray I don‚Äôt lose one or some of them. I suspected in my 46 years that I was surrounded by idiots; never so much as the last couple years. This is out of my hands as an older brother, uncle, elder.
1/-1	We ar still doing some research about vaccine Africa must wake up
0/-1	We are 83% plus vaccinate for the ages 5+. That is incredible in itself. The only way to get to 100% is to give up certain freedoms and force the vaccine. Is this what people are cheering for here? What is the goal of these restrictions?
0/0	We are LAB RATS... Thanks. BUT NO THANKS. Full research... hahahah,, we will let you know in a few years once we test these people...
0/0	We are Now All Test Subjects!!!
1/1	We are administering more vaccines than we are recording new cases. This is good.
0/0/0	We are all Guinea Pigs if your game then go ahead get the jab. I'm not one of the Government's Guinea Pigs
0/0	We are all being controlled, the masks are a fear tactic. Don't get the vaccine
1/1	We are all hoping for corona vaccine.
0/1	We are all lab rat's in life really !
1/1	We are already aware of the effects of the vaccine and there's little to none.
0	We are basically ALL their TEST subjects
0/0	We are being turned into Lab Rats. No thank You.
0/0	We are born with perfect immune systems !! Why destroy them so the evil elite can keep us sick and keep getting rich on our demise !!! Wake up sleepers !!!
1/1	We are essentially giving our cells a manual, with a sticky note saying "be better"
1/1	We are excited to be a part of history, hoping to get back to our normal lifestyle and see everyone smile again!
1/1	We are far from the end of the pandemic, but we are closer to alleviating more death and suffering
1/1	We are fully vaccinated and got to hug our grandkids for first time in a year. Feeling so thankful and blessed
0/-1	We are getting attacked by the world elites
1/1	We are getting enough doses at our hospital for every employee, plus a handful of extras. A survey was sent out basically asking ‚Äúwill you be in round 1 or not‚Äù and 70 odd percent of the hospital answered no. I‚Äôm taking the damn shot, I have immune compromised people at home, I can‚Äôt afford to spread this shit. But due to dumbasses we are a long way from protecting healthcare workers.
1/1	We are getting the vaccine at work soon. I hope they get it as well.
0/0/0/0	We are hesitant due to the fact that I, and others have spread the word around that we are waiting until further symptoms may be shown later on. We KNOW, it may be safe, but we don't wanna risk it. Some of us have lost some good friends this year and it's honestly pressuring.
0/0	We are in a vaccine program. A program! designed to keep people sick.
0/0	We are in a world controlled by a corrupted form of magic....Thats why you see the Bindrune symbol on the ambulance.
0/0	We are just experiments. I can feel it.
1/1	We are locked in a race between distributing vaccines and the spread of COVID-19 variants. Do your part by wearing a mask, social distancing, and getting vaccine when it's your turn. We will defeat this virus together.
1/1	We are looking forward to receiving the vaccine. We are on our way to return to normal living.
1/1	We are lucky we live in india. Vaccine is free and available for all.
1/1	We are no there yet but these vaccine trials look very promising. Hero's the lot of them. I hope they get recognised accordingly.
0/0	We are not antivaxer. We are against taking EXPEREMENTAL vaccines. Which is never mentioned
0/0	We are not lab rat.
0/0	We are not protected by the vaccine,when we had the vaccine our health is not safe anymore,i feel it now.and i knew some of my friends completed the vaccine still catch the virus and I'm fully vaccinated too. i felt that i get more weaker ,your killing people
0/0	We are not puppets! My body . My blood!
0/0	We are not science experiments! If YOU want to be one, be one! But stop experimenting on innocent children who don‚Äôt have a say in the matter!
0/0	We are not taking it so piss off
0/-1	We are people not live stock... Forcing a vaccination is tyranny...
0/0	We are phase III, we are still in the experimental phase. this is not approved, it is under emergency use authorization, only.
0/-1	We are ready to face your wrath, we ain't buying your vaccine story, so do what you must
1/1	We are so blessed that we have this vaccine so soon.
1/1	We are so grateful that have had our vaccine, we thought everything was very well organised. A big thank you to all, we know how busy you are but you always seem to answer with a smile
1/0	We are the beta test batch. I'd add I'd be happy to be in it, the alpha group all seem to have come through.
0/0	We are the guinea pigs for the vaccine
1/1	We are the ones who must build a safety net to those who can not build resistance themselves. I will take the risk of the vaccine but only after I find more sensible clarity in it.
0/-1	We are under attack by MSM
1/1	We are vaccinated and boosted. We shielded totally before vaccines due to clinically extremely vulnerable, but not now, and we have never caught it. Due in part to being reasonably careful, but there have been Covid has killed millions of people. The vaccine is safe and effective. My kiddo is fully vaccinated and doing greatexposures, and the vaccines have protected us I feel.
1/1	We are very happy to have it, so we can protect ourselves and others a little better. We still wear masks and hand sanitize, but atleast with Vaccine we are a little bit more protected.
1/1	We are way past time to just start euthanizing the anti-vaxers and coronavirus deniers. They had their chance to be decent human beings and they squandered it.
0/0	We are witnessing murder
0	We are worried about a 2% death rate. Well, just with ordinary vaccines themselves, there is 2% serious adverse reactions. No one talks about that. There is no drug or vaccine that is 100% safe for everyone
0/0	We as Americans, should not have to take the vaccine. So no, we are not going to take it. Fuck off.
1/1	We asked, and #Michigan #K12 parents answered, with photos of their little patriots who have gotten the #CovidVaccine to protect themselves and others! Thank you to these role models for other kids and teens.
0	We been in this planet for thousands of years without vaccines, now they telling us that we need one.
1/-1	We can do this together
1/1	We can go to Mars with mRNA n clear cancer soon. The scripts in my lungs felt like Alien adjust my lungs into another density
1/1	We can leave the politics out. Covid Vaccines all over the world are saving lives and the side effects are negligible. Why are people taking risk with their lives.
1/0	We can not get everyone in every country in the world vaccinated. So the whole "if we don't get everyone vaccinated we give the virus a chance to mutate" WILL happen even if everyone in the USA is vaccinated.
0/0	We can still love and care for our neighbors without taking the vaccine.
1/1	We can stop the mutation with the vaccine
0/-1	We can trust the science but can we trust the people behind the science?
1/1	We can vaccine, but remember omicron came from Africa, with low vacc rates. The whole world needs vaccination or it will keep mutating.
1/0	We can't continue to vaccinate everyone on the planet in two dose shots every 12 months. It's not sustainable for a variety of reasons.
0/0	We can't let big companies mandate experimental vaccines!
0/0	We cannot find the videos about true side effects. That is the reason of the vaccine is not trustworrhy, and will never be.
1/0	We cant sit back until, every single person will be vaccinated daily.
1/1	We can‚Äôt put in to words how excited we were to give 97 year-old Facey patient Ruth Zamora the first dose of vaccine at our newly opened vaccination clinic in Mission Hills this morning.
0/0	We can‚Äôt trust them. Very many vaccinated individuals got covid after Moderna vaccines
0/0	We choose not to treat Covid, instead we are told to rely on a vaccine that doesn‚Äôt offer immunity, doesn‚Äôt stop transmission and we have no clue about long term affects. My kid is has been unable to walk since she got it and I‚Äôm told it‚Äôs just a coincidence, my ass it is.
1/1	We could all use a rise in morality. Yay for vaccines!
1/1	We could have been over this virus by now, and maybe not had a mutant version if everyone had masked up, stayed home, and gotten vaccinated. We now will probably be fighting this for another year. 600,000 plus dead.
0/0	We could see something like a huge uptick in cancer (for example) years from now. The truth is even the best doctors and scientists cannot know for sure how that will play out until we've actually tried it.
0/0	We defeated vaccine passports We defeated vaccine mandates Now we end mask wearing, pointless mass testing and we ensure that they halt the vaccine roll out before it causes more damage or death especially to children. We cannot stop fighting until it all ends they face justice
0/0	We demand to impose a moratorium on the adoption of the PANDEMIC agreement !!! The peoples of the countries represented at the World Health Assembly were not properly informed and informed about the content of the documents being submitted for discussion. We reserve the right to oppose the signing of the said pandemic agreement by any legal means and REFUSE the OFFER upon its acceptance and ratification
1/-1	We didn't need those people anyways
0/0	We didn't want the shot but we were forced or loose the means to take care for our families Doc.
1/-1	We do it for to protect the people we love
0/0	We do not consent to "the jab"
0/0	We do not know of the long term safety profile of the vaccine, that will take time to gather the data
0/-1	We do not know the duration of this benefit
0/0	We do not know whether the vaccine will prevent infection and protect against onward transmission.
0/0/0	We do not what these vaccines will do inside of our bodies as we are taking the 'dead Corona cells' to develop immunity as 'human baits'. Better to stay healthy and wait for better vaccines.
0/0	We don't Scared VACCINE.. this VACCINE is changing DNA AND IT'S 666..MARK OF THE BEAST‚Ä¶
0/0	We don't even know how this affects adults in the long run and now we're putting it in our kids.
0	We don't get vaccinated because: 1) recovered; 2) ALL of the risk group in my area are vaccinated. 3) I do not get vaccinated for the general public.
0/0	We don't know but we still want you as a gini pig. No thank you. If you dont have answers why should we be used as lab rats. Ddt use to be "safe". And stupid people showered under it. Untill they found out otherwise.....
1/1	We don't know of any negative side-effects for the vaccine. The disease, though, has many negative side-effects, including death. So I'm taking the vaccine the moment I can.
1/1	We don't know the long term effects of anything, even the hot cheetos you probably eat or basically anything you take or eat at the store. I understand your concerns but at least apply this to everything you put in your body.
0/0	We don't know what are in these vaccines. For all we know it contains microchips to control our DNA. Beware...
0/0	We don't know what the long term side effects are
0/0	We don't know yet effect of covid vaccine to our body!''''..wait for the results for those WHO RISK THERSELF OR VOLUNTER FOR VACCINE
0/0	We don't need NO VACCINATION!!! YOU GOTTA FIGHT FOR YOUR RIGHTS!!! #fuckcovid19 #fuckvaccine
0/0	We don't need a rushed through novel vaccine for a virus with a 99,8% recovery rate (CDC)
0/0	We don't need a vaccine for this overblown flu-strain. Enough with the fear-mongering.
0/0	We don't need a vaccine. Or a mask.
0/0	We don't need it. It changes your DNA.
1/1	We don't need more explained videos. We need more vaccines.
0/0	We don't need no vaccination! We don't need no forced control!
0/0	We don't need no vaccination, hey politicians, leave us people alone.
0/0	We don't need other garbage to injet in our body, stop this vaccines.
0/0	We don't need this vaccine! The whole thing is a massive scam to alter the human body! People are dying from these vaccines!

0/0	We don't need your vaccine
0/0	We don't need your vaccine Leave Africa for Africans
0/0	We don't want or need vaccines
0/0	We don't want vaccine here in Africa because we never see person with covid 19.
0	We don't want your vaccine
0/0/0/0	We don't want yur evil vaccines
0/0	We dont know what this is
0/0	We dont need any more vaccines. We need a huge national chill pill and get back to business as usual. It. Is. Just. A. Cold
0/0	We dont need those vaccines here in malawi. We r safe and we dont've aproof of wat u so called corona virus' existence. Seems like uhave something evil wich uwana do with this world bt it wont prosper!!! COUNT ON MY SAY
0/0	We dont need you wicked dirty poison. In our blood.
0/0	We dont need your killer vaccines
0/0	We dont trust the vaccine....how difficult is that to understand ?
0/0	We dont want it! Because we are healthy and dont need it! Not rocket science trust and have faith on our own immune systems!
0/0	We don‚Äôt care how you made this stuff we‚Äôre not taking it!
0/0	We don‚Äôt even know if covif 19 vaccination stops you from being contagious, let alone long term health issues.
0/0	We don‚Äôt even know if it stops you from being contagious, let alone long term health issues
0/0/0/0	We don‚Äôt even know if it stops you from being contagious, let alone long term health issues.
0/0	We don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs inside of those shots... it‚Äôs probably not good for you at all!
1/0	We don‚Äôt have a common cold vaccine because there are a lot of different viruses associated with the common cold. Most are rhinoviruses but some are versions of coronaviruses. It is hard to make a generic vaccine that can target all of them since there is variations.
0/0/0/0	We don‚Äôt have evidence that the vaccines in use in the US (Pfizer or Moderna) prevent transmission.
1/0	We don‚Äôt know at what rate vaccinated people transmit. It is almost certainly much inhibited
0/0	We don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs this garbage vaccine will react in our body
0/0	We don‚Äôt need a vaccine because there are Therapeutics and survival rate of something like 99.996%
0/0	We don‚Äôt need a vaccine for something that is 99% survivable I will take my .0002% chance thank you.
0/0	We don‚Äôt need it. It changes your DNA.
0/0	We don‚Äôt need them ... what the government has done to us all is one of the cruellest things I‚Äôve ever experienced in my life. Whatever it takes I will make sure those responsible are exposed!! They will be held accountable
0/0/0	We don‚Äôt want your ‚Äòtrial‚Äô vaccine, we aren‚Äôt rats
0/0	We eat the virus ....we are not afraid of it.....strong immune system is the key to fight viruses......not just a vaccine anymore....it's idiotic to hold on to vaccine
1/1	We gave 100 vaccines at our office on Saturday, and averaging 30 per week before that. Thank you so much!
1/1	We get a different "cocktail" of vaccine with the flu jab each winter depending on which viruses are dominant in that year so that will probably happen with Covid as well. No vaccine is completely safe but the trials will work out what the best "mix" is.
1/0	We get a vaccine and still have to wear the mask for another 2 years, wow, that's great!
1/1	We get the flu shot every year and will definitely get the Covid vaccine as well!!
1/1	We got a safe vaccine that gives good protection against severe disease and death
1	We got our Covid card today!! Our second Covid shot! Our first shot protected us against Covid after my 18 Month son was exposed to it at daycare a week after we got our first vaccine shot! It works people!!
1/1	We got our first Pfizer shots last week. Husband was fine, and I just ended up being a bit sleep and rocked an extremely sore arm. Totally worth it! Here‚Äôs hoping the second one goes smoothly haha. Cheers everyone.
1/1	We got our first vaccine and are anxiously waiting for our second. The numbers of those who have already gotten Covid-19 vaccine is outstanding. Thank you CDC for keeping us informed.
1/1	We got our second Pfizer covid vaccine yesterday. Been very pleased with the mild side effects. Will take them over battling covid any day. Thank you for your work, prayers the data continues to come back positive.
1/1	We got our shots...and it works
0/1	We got rid of liability for all vaccines in the early 90s
1/1	We got the Oxford vaccine. It works. It really works.
1/1	We got the flu shot and will get the Covid vaccine when available.
1/1	We got to stick to the rules so we can be with our family at Christmas
1/1	We had the Vaccine as soon as we could. The advantage of being old!!
0/0	We hate the covid vaccine
0/-1	We have a birth right to freedom to roam, speech, thought, decision making and choice and much much more and we DON'T need their corporate fake structures and rules and FAKE legalese to tie us up
1/1	We have a couple anti-vax neighbors. Both healthy farm types with no comorbidities that I know of. The wife is dead, the husband is in hospital for a second time. Get vaccinated
0/0	We have a friend that had a stroke right after injection!
0/0	We have a right to choose !! Feel like they are going to say we can‚Äôt go back into society unless we have the vacine
1	We have a strict policy no unvaccinated relatives and their spawn cross our threshold.
1/1	We have a vacation booked for eight weeks after the second shot. We'll still mask up, but I feel we'll be alright by then.
1/1	We have a vaccine and folks still playing dumb. Smh. Ruining for everyone else .
1/1	We have been getting Pfizer for months here in Australia. No issues, so far!
0/0	We have been told that drug trials take 10 years (to insure their safety). Yet now, in a matter of months an Arsenal of vaccines are being released for use. Even the simplest of minds can see that something doesn‚Äôt add up... No option here other than raising red flags & suspicions...!
1/1	We have decades of vaccine research that shows that adverse effects almost always manifest themselves within 2 months of a vaccine. We now have people who are a year out from their vaccines. These are incredibly safe by any objective measure.
0/0	We have empirical evidence showing that the vaccines do not work to protect people from contracting Covid.
1/1	We have far more selfish and undereducated people unwilling to get vaccinated, despite their pre-existing conditions.
0/0	We have immune systems that do the same thing. I would never put that garbage in my body.
0/0	We have looked at our quarterly earnings and have determined that children as young as 6 months now need to be vaccinated.
0/0	We have never made a vaccine for any human strains of SARS successfully.
0/0	We have never vaccinated ourselves out of a virus that has animal reserves. Why do you think min 30k die of the flu each year? Children will still get Covid but are at nil risk. Deal with it like the flu don't inject them with experimental vaccines that will never work!
0/0	We have no data on these mrna jabs whatsoever. Dr. R0bert Mal0ne, who created mrna, has been saying for decades and still says it, that mrna jabs should never EVER be used on humans as we don't know anything about them. Their side effects far outweigh any benefits. Open your eyes and do some research.
1/1	We have one of the very best and most effective vaccination programmes of any advanced nation. That seems to grate on some people for some bizarre reason.
1/1	We have our appointments for Thursday, looking forward to it!!
0/0	We have our own dna to protect
1	We have seen the results of people not taking the vaccine seriously. The vaccine has helped people fight second wave. Those who were not vaccinated have seen the adverse effect.
0/0	We have the freedom to choose what is best for our own health.
0/0	We have the right to choose our way of life we don‚Äôt need others trying to convince us to take the vaccines.
1/-1	We have the right to choose whether or not to vaccinate, and vaccination is not a carnival like the current Olympics.
0/0	We have to be told the side effects and long term risks before we get the jab.
0/0	We have to get the unvaccinated vaccinated to make them safe so we can protect the vaccinated who have already been made safe.
1/1	We have vaccination but the people don't want to follow the rules so the virus is still spreading
0/-1	We haven‚Äôt lived long enough to see the long term effects of the vaccine on people‚Äôs health and fertility. I think that if that is your reason to not get the vaccine that is understandable and should be respected, especially considering this vaccine has been created much faster than for other diseases. In average it takes 5 years to develop a vaccine and this took about 1.
1/1	We hope this is the beggining of the end
1/1	We hope to see children get vaccinated.
1	We just need a global government to make everyone vaccinate
1/1	We just need more vaccinators. More local sites
0/0	We just spent 12 months hibernating to avoid getting Covid now you are going to line us all up and inject us with it , if the amount of time and money was spent to find a cure a way to kill the virus injecting everyone with a small dose of Covid in the whim and hope that people develop an immunity to it is just RIDICULOUS there are ways to kill the virus and I have been Silenced too long Wake up to yourself before you inject everyone and end up with 5 million DEAD and 10 million infected and the other 10 million only protected for 2 months when the Virus Evolves Again!!!. Seek and destroy is the only way to go where would we all be today if this was our goal ???? I'll tell iu where we would be WORLD Leaders find the CURE fuck the Vaccine off you are asking for trouble with it .
1/1	We just want to live our lives without worrying of getting infected
0/0	We keep reading stories and hearing news about people dying two days after taking the vaccine. That does not make Me feel to comfortable especially seeing one drug company gave up on the idea and actually said that human immunology is the best way as has been taking place for thousands of years. I would like to donate my dose to anyone who wants it.
1/1	We knew all along the vaccine was safe. People fall ill all the time, that‚Äôs normal, but you you can‚Äôt blame it on Easter eggs, aspirin, toothpaste etc.
0/0	We know NOTHING about long-term side effects!
0/0	We know how mRNA vaccines are made, but we don't know yet if any longterm effects. There are concerns with fertility. I question why healthy young people would need this shot when the recovery rate is basically 100%, unlike the recovery rates for diseases, in which we get childhood vaccinations for.
0/0	We know it‚Äôs a SCAM because you do not need vaccines for coronaviruses with 99% survival rates.
1/1	We know little about the omicron variant. Probably the labs will adapt their vaccine but in the meantime, the variant that can send frail people to hospital is the delta which is in the majority. Do the booster in the frail as a priority.
1/1	We like the shot! üíâüíâ
1/1	We literally went on an adventure to get our COVID vaccines today. I wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to be vaccinated with anyone el√¢‚Ç¨
1/1	We live in a time where even going to the hospital is risky. And people still dont want to take the vaccine ?
1/1	We live in a town called Arandas Jalisco Mexico, and we are dying from covid_19 every day there are new patients ,,, authorities, please deploy the vaccine in Mexico .. God bless you.
1/1	We live in a world where people trust random people on the internet rather than specialists. Its stupid. Im taking my shots, gl iditots.
1/1/1/0/1	We live in the age of MISINFORMATION, more people would rather believe some random post they saw a friend post on Facebook than listen to an actual scientist. Truly crazy times we live in
0/0	We lost any trust in rich people and governments
0/0/0/0/0/0/0	We lost any trust in rich people and governments.
0/0	We lost any trust in rich people and governments. No vaccine for me
1/1	We love You Potus FANTASTIC shot in the arm, and so convenient not far to go, we must be the pinnacle example of a nation for vaccines, POTUS shire greatness with your speech today was brilliant, amazing. Our nation is blessed
1/1/0	We mandate education standards for the well-being of children, and mandate standards for what counts as illegal abuse or neglect. By the same reasoning, i think we can mandate vaccines.
1/1	We may get our lives back sooner!
0	We must be free to decide to take it or not. Period.
1/1	We must continue to spread awareness of the benefits of getting vaccinated as well as make the vaccine more accessible to black and brown communities. #COVID19 #CovidVaccine #JohnsonandJohnson
1/1	We must do everything possible to reduce the circulation of #COVID19 and delay mutations that may reduce the efficacy of existing vaccines.
1/0	We must first accelerate vaccination dramatically, curb superspreaders, enforce masks etc. We should have been doing this for months. Lockdowns come when these measures fail.
1/1	We must force people to take the vaccine!! As a father of two, I am concerned deeply for my children. It should be mandatory that all Americans stay inside, all day! I recently went through divorce because my wife went out in the public. Please, Mr. President, my kids need it!
1/1/1/1	We must help our government or support them to bring the best vaccine so we can get rid of all this
0/0	We must not get the jab no matter what! Hang in there friends!
1/-1	We must recognize that in spite of these reports of potential negative side effects, evidence shows the benefits of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine still strongly outweigh the risks.
0/0	We must stand up and not take the vaccine!! Period!
1/1	We must stop this Virus as soon is possible ! For Better and stronger America ! Wear a mask social distance and get a vaccine !
1/1	We need 65 to 70% of us to get the vaccine otherwise it could go on forever just like polio or diphtheria would have. Stop being so paranoid people. You are the problem if you dont get the shot. Stop being babies and stop the stupidity.
1/1	We need AstraZeneca+Oxford university vaccine!!
0/0	We need Jesus not a vaccine
0/0	We need a "vaccination" /protection against Corporate Fraud, Treason and Lies, not against the scamdemic virus.
1/1	We need a coronavirus vaccine
1/-1	We need a movement to eliminate speed limit mandates! Why should the government have the right to tell us how fast we can drive? It's about our freedom. The Marxist nanny state people claim speed limits save lives. However we know that following speed limits actually puts you more at risk of accidents because you're on the road longer so have more opportunity to get in a wreck compared to driving as fast as you can from point A to point B.
1/0	We need a universal vaccine otherwise you're not fighting C19 alone but also vaccine snobbery and conspiracy theories thereof.
1/-1	We need a vaccine against anti vaccine claims going viral. Oh wait...
1/1	We need a vaccine that can protect people from stupidity. Now. I would buy that for a dollar.
1/1	We need a vaccine to protect the elderly.
1/1	We need a vaccine.
1/-1	We need all the support we can get to make people understand why this is necessary and a must
1/1	We need all the vaccines they can make to slow down and stop people from getting sick or dying .
1/0	We need as many ppl as we can get vaccinated because viruses evolve and if more ppl go out with incomplete vaccinations and interact with ppl from different areas carrying different strains. This problem will last longer than it should. Unnecessary deaths will continue beyond the Trump foolishness
1/0	We need booster shots for other diseases, but they are safe FDA approved those vaccines
1/1	We need boosters because they work. Understood
0/0	We need germs and bacteria, we are only hurting ourselves with all these antibacterial cleaners, the healthiest people live on farm's
1/1/1	We need lifesaving COVID-19 vaccines in every community across the country. That means we need comprehensive aid to all states, cities and counties to administer the vaccine quickly and efficiently.
0/0	We need money to survive not your vaccines
0/-1	We need more people like her here in Australia as everyone seems to have their heads in the sand over the vaccine
1/1	We need rescue. The world needs to be rescued from the hardships of this virus.
0/0/0	We need the Republican politicians to vaccinate the Democrat politicians and the Democrat politicians to vaccinate the Republican politicians, on camera, with an independant public forum verifying that they use real vaccines to see how well they trust these vaccines.
1/1	We need the Vaccine.... FAST!
1/1	We need the vaccine already to end this madness.
1/1	We need the vaccine in Antigua. I am ready for it.
1/1	We need the vaccine just as we got the ones when we were baby‚Äôs and children
1/1	We need the vaccine to save people and lives.
1/1	We need this vaccine!!!
1	We need to achieve the coverage needed to realise herd immunity in every community.
0/0	We need to ban all vaccines. Period! Not one vaccine has been through the Gold Star Standard of testing and not one vaccine has done a double blind test. The MMR Vaccine has created over 77 million autistic kids globally, 80% black boys. The WHO just admitted to the MMR and Autism connection
1/1	We need to break the chain of transmission - of ignorance! GET VACCINATED!!
1/-1	We need to educate people about vaccination.
1/1	We need to eliminate this virus. Therefore PLEASE!!! Take it!
0/0	We need to focus on healthy immune systems not vaccines , I‚Äôm not taking it

1/1	We need to get our high school athletes vaccinated. It's the younger crowd that's falling ill now.
0/0	We need to get over this flu, no vaccines needed!
1/1	We need to get the vaccine if we want to save our lives‚Ä¶
1/1	We need to get the whole world vaccinated
1/1	We need to keep Responsible for Social Dectencing and Fallow Covid Guidelines I think it won't be over from another 6 months that's my Personal opinion about it that is all to say
1/1	We need to let anti-vaxers kill themselves.
1/1	We need to make vaccines mandatory
1/1	We need to protect eachother, the best way to do it is by taking the vaccine!
1/1	We need to stay united and care for eachother by taking the vaccine.
1/1	We need to take care of our body! Take vaccines
1/1	We need to take the vaccine! The children can‚Äôt go to school if not vacinatted
0/0	We need to trust GOD not some suspect injection
1/1/1/1	We need vaccinations against stupidity.
0/0	We never give a new drug to pregnant women, this is very disturbing. Didnt they learn from Thalidomide?!
1/1/1	We never treated this virus seriously. It's not flu. It's not cold. You want to live with the virus? Then get yearly jabs of covid vaccine every winter as well as flu jabs.
1/1	We now have FIVE, yes FIVE, generations of our family vaccinated! It was a lot of work and persistence scheduling them all but we got it done.
1/-1	We now have a permanent, substantially dumb, underclass of people. 40 years of underfunding public education starting with Reagan and this is where we are.
1/1	We now have sufficient experience to confirm the importance of vaccination against COVID-19 during pregnancy. Indeed, vaccination can be done without risk at any stage of pregnancy
0/0	We now know natural immunity is stronger and longer than vaccine immunity. It‚Äôs time to apologize and rehire doctors and nurses fired even though they already had contracted COVID.
1/-1	We now realize we were played.
1/1	We owe to our parents and grandparents to protect them by vaccinating.
1/1	We really dropped the ball in containing the virus but at least we're doing good on vaccinations.
1/1/1/1/1	We really need the vaccine as soon as possible it is so slow
1/0	We really need vaccine for stupidity. Many many patients awaiting as you see
1/1	We received our Pfizer vaccine yesterday. A heartfelt gratitude to everyone who works at Pfizer and BioNtech - you are literally saving the world. I know so many of you worked so hard and continue to work tirelessly. My gratitude is immeasurable. Thank you!
0/0	We refuse Vaccine üëçüëç
0/0	We should all ask ourselves do these Vaccines really work or are they marketing gimmicks? I know numerous people including myself who was vaccinated and still ended up with COVID. Even the COVID tests are not 100% accurate. There is lot of nonsensical theories people are spreading at the same time. Believe in your own body and don‚Äôt trust anyone. Pray and take care of yourselves.
1/1	We should all get vaccinated
1/1	We should also be grateful for the Pfizer/Biontech vaccine which jump-started the vaccination programme.
0/1	We should be able to make a pretty huge dent in the death rate by late January with some strong prioritization.
0/0	We should be worried as the vaccine was rushed
1/1	We should get vaccinated with both of the doses. Additionally, there is also a need to acknowledge everyone the value of being vaccinated. Get vaccinated and spread awareness for vaccination.
1/1	We should grateful to all scientist
1/1	We should have nationwide vaccines mandate.
1/1	We should look forward to the day that 100% of the patients of the hospital are vaccinated. Then we have achieved success with the vaccination campaign
0/0	We should never let the possibility of death get in the way of receiving an experimental vaccine.
1/1	We should not just keep waiting for several more years while this pandemic wreaks havoc on us we need vaccine .
1/1	We should not let those "vaccine skeptics" (who we should call anti-vaxxers) infect other people as it pleases them. We, others, have been silent too long now!!!!!
1/1	We should open source our vaccines, that would help a lot.
0/-1	We should respect the choices of people. We all can make the choice for our health & our bodies. But also for others around us.
0/-1	We should start calling it a mRna Therapy shot, not a "vaccine" because it is essentially not functioning as a "vaccine". Or call it something else, cause its not...a..."Vaccine".
0/0	We should start with Journalists that say it is safe.
1/1	We should thank the anti-vaxxers for their noble sacrifices. Their efforts will improve the national gene pool and elevate the public conversations with their increased absence.
1/1	We shouldn't convice the unvaccinated to get the vaccine. We should wait for them to pass on.
0/0	We simply don't know about long term effects. There hasn't been enough time
0/0	We so called anti vaxxers know the truth. You only sell propaganda. We see thru all of yours lies. The sad part is the others that buy into it are mostly brain dead.
1/1	We stand on the shoulders of giants. Research from previous MERS and SARS have given us research for almost 10 years
0/0	We stand with our truckers in the USA and in Canada. No vaccine mandate!
0/0	We still don't know what the long term effects are. It may be safe for a couple days but most meds are. I can take penicillin for a few days but after that no. Statin drugs are tolerated for a few days but after that the effects are horrible. You don't know the full effects until later.
0/0	We still have no long term studies of the vaccine, how can this be approved without that information?
1/1	We strongly recommended #Covid19 vaccination for children 5 to 11 years of age. Find out how to get an appointment in your area: http://ow.ly/8Xb050HECsh
1/1	We sure love complaining about everything in the UK, but we have done so well with this vaccine rollout. I'm rather proud.
1/1	We take Vaccines and medicines so we dont die at 50 like they did 200 years ago. Its not rocket science
1/-1	We thank you for the support and encouragement
1/1	We the good people of Bauchi state Nigeria,are aware of your good effort n love towards us by providing for us free vaccines in our state.Thankyou so much for the kind gesture.
0/0	We the people dont want to be turned into a gmo organism
1/1	We vaccinated about 130 individuals over the weekend at Grant! Thank you to all the dedicated volunteers and participants! #togethertowardhealth #letsgetvacccinated
1/1	We vaccinated over 300 elders and staff at my work in January. No issues for anyone.
0/0	We want and need secure vaccines, proved sufficiently before inoculating the people...I prefer to die for COVID, that for a NON SECURE VACCINE!!!!!
0/0	We want medicine, remedy and cure for this . Not vaccines. We are not laboratory rats !!!
0/0	We want medicine, remedy and cure for this. Not vaccines. We are not laboratory rats !!!
1/1	We were ill after ours but will still definitely be having the second dose, we need to do everything we can to get this COVID under control.
0/0	We were pressured into getting the vaccine so my kids could go to school, and I panicked afterwards because I had realized what I had just done. Thankfully my natural healing friends told me just the trick to get all the harmful toxins out!! You cut up a potato and make a necklace out of it, and you wear it until it turns all black from all the toxins!! I swear me and my kids felt so much better after doing this, you have got to try it!!
0/-1	We were promised our lives back after certain level of vaccination, and we are still very limited all around, after that level was achieved. I feel deceived and have no trust in what I am being told by mass media anymore.
0/0	We were warned years ago, more pandemics coming, we were given cure, do not trust vaccines!
1/-1	We weren‚Äôt complaining about the flu shot every 12 months! (and not even that many ppl were dying from it!!) but this is where we draw the line?
0/0	We whole family are not vaccined
1/1	We will beat the pandemic!
0/0	We will definitely say no to the vaccine.
0/0/0	We will die one day for sure. Hell no to this poison
0/0	We will not get vaccinated and sign our own death warrants.
1/1	We will only get this global corona pandemic under control if we enable vaccination for all people worldwide. Health must not be made dependent on whether a person is the supply or a drug can afford financially
1/1	We will see this in US, once we have more than 50% of population vaccinated.
1/1	We will wave Corona goodbye with these vaccines!
0/0	We witnessed how Johnson & Johnson treated people who got cancer from using their powder. NO THANKS üò°
0/0/0	We won't know what the long term effects are for at least a year or longer from this being widely distributed. It's perfectly sensible to not rush to take a newly developed vaccine - and to reserve it for those who have a priority need for it.
0/0	We won‚Äôt be having a covid vaccine... maybe in 10 years time when we know the long term effects of it!
0/-1	We won‚Äôt know who‚Äôs died with the vaccine but we will know who‚Äôs died without the vaccine.
0/0	We won‚Äôt take the vaccine because it won‚Äôt have had adequate testing and is already causing some people some pretty horrific ailments.
0/-1	We wouldn‚Äôt want those bits to activate before they‚Äôre inside somebody
1/1	We'll explained! I hope that enough people have faith in our scientific institutions to take the vaccine so we can fight back the virus. The worst case here is that not enough people take it to develop community immunity. This video certainly helps, but for each credible video like this there are 100 videos propagating fear because it's easier to make a video where you make up the content yourself.
1/1	We'll get our lives back this year, I assure you, this nightmare will end soon!
1/1	We'll see. as I'm at the high risk persons list, I got the 1st dose last month and will have the 2nd dose in 2 weeks. I'll let you know.
1/1	We're all in this together, folks. Every person on the planet is equally affected. This virus does not discriminate. Please, fellow people around the world, get vaccinated as soon as you have a chance.
1/1	We're getting our second dose in early April. All signs point to extremely reduced chances of transmission once vaccinated. We will continue to wear masks where required in public, but we will start actually doing things again and seeing our families.
0/0	We're human beings and as such we have ancient human rights; the council of Europe decrees that vaccines must NOT be mandatory and the non-vaccinated NOT discriminated against. I'm sick to death of being rode roughshod over
1/1	We're in a life threatening pandemic. We have no defense. So, for most people, they should absolutely get it.
1/-1	We're just making up numbers now...
0/0	We're not being told how many people are dying or being injured by these experimental gene therapies. I just read that this week a guy got his 2nd dose of one of the vaccines and went blind two days later.
0/0	We're seeing serious "allergic reactions" to these vaccines already that require hospitalization. The establishment also tells us these RNA vaccines can't rewrite our DNA...but now apparently they can through reverse transcriptases
0/0	We're told the science is settled. We're told vaccines are "safe and effective". We're told that vaccines do not cause autism. We're told to believe otherwise is to be a conspiracy theorist. Here is what we're NOT told about vaccines and autism:
0/-1/0	We've been fucked by pharmaceutical companies time and time again falsifying their results and rushing testing. Profit based development of medical sciences has destroyed the public's trust in it, capitalism has only itself to blame.
0/0	We've been lied to too much and now that me and all of my friends and family have had covid both vaxxed and non vaxxed with similar symptoms its obvious to me that it is nothing to worry about for me specifically. Also the flu was way worse and i never get that shot.
0/0	We've done a lot of testing using mRNA vaccine's... That haven't been that successful. Just take this new one we made in 6 months okay
1/1	We've got a new way to distiguish between people that payed attention in school or not, anti-vaxxers or not... Please just take the shot people...
1/1/1/1	We've had to take vaccines from childhood for polio, diphtheria, etc to adulthood for many types of influenza. So why not now? Looks like we have no other choice. I was very scared about taking the vaccine because I am a senior and the most allergic person in the world but I didn't have a problem. I'm still around.
0/0	We've only just started vaccinating and people are dying already from the jabs , what the heck is going on , why isn't the MSM reporting this
1/1	We've passed 700,000 total vaccine doses administered in WA. These vaccines are an incredible scientific achievement, but we must get them into arms. That's why we're rapidly expanding our distribution program.We only have a small amount of vaccine, but we'll use every dose.
1/1	We've seen the best and the worst of what humanity has to offer this year. The developers of these vaccines deserve recognition.
1/1	We, the jabbed, will suffer the consequences of the non jabbed ones‚Ä¶
0/0	Weak dumb People looooove to feel some kind of superiority complex, first it was with the mask now it‚Äôs with the vaccine
0/0	Weakened viruses in vaccines do make people sick, if they have weak immunity.
0/0	Wear a mask good for you take a vaccine good for you sick of masks good for me not taking vaccine good for me you be you I‚Äôll be me
1/1	Wear a mask, get the vaccine. What's so hard to understand?
1/1	Wear a mask, social distance, stay home, wash your hands and get the covid 19 vaccination. Let's defeat this disease.
1/1	Wear a mask, stay alive, get vaccine. It's pretty simple, but some people just can't be smart.
1/1	Wear a mask. Get a shot. Might need a booster. Grave sacrifices to personal freedom? Really??? It‚Äôs not as if we‚Äôre asking you to storm the beaches at Normandy. It's the bare minimum to help save your life and maybe the lives of others - including children. Smdh.
1/1	Wear mask and maintain social distance and one more thing Get Vaccinated free of cost at every Government hospital
1/1	Wearing masks and keeping social distance have been proven effective to prevent airborne infection for over 100 years, since the Spanish flu outbreak in 1918.
1/1	Wearing masks and social distancing help reduce your chance of being exposed to the virus or spreading it to others, but these measures are not enough. Vaccines will work with your immune system so it will be ready to fight the virus if you are exposed.
0/0/0	Weigh the risks & rewards of treating C19 as ‚Äú1% fatality rate‚Äù disease vs risks and rewards (or lack thereof) of the vaccine. Also attach the manmade unproven tax on the vaccine where people don‚Äôt want to feel like lab rats + underreporting of vaccine deaths.
0/1	Weighing interests against each other: personal freedom to decide for oneself about vaccination against the necessary protection for risk groups through a high vaccination rate.
0/0	Weird how my wife has the vaccine and has been more sick this year than any other. Myself and my kids don't have the vaccine and we have been fine. We all caught covid and it was no worse then a common cold.
0/0	Weird how nobody's making videos for innocent children about how AWESOME their IMMUNE SYSTEM are... and how to make them even STRONGER !!!!
1/1	Weird, I took my first covid shot of Moderna two weeks ago. I had mild side effects, Fatigue, chills and head aches, one day after the vaccine and felt invincible after that. But I have been feeling like crap before taking the vaccine since April , mostly dizziness, fatigue, and asthma. Maybe I had covid at some point and never noticed. I never had a fever.
1/1	Weird. 92% of Texans who died from COVID in 2021 were unvaccinated. Zero died from the vaccine. Elementary school math should help this make sense
1/1	Welcome to 2021, where people believe there‚Äôs a microchip in vaccine
0/0	Welcome to all your new auto -immune disorders
0/0	Welcome to all your new auto -immune disorders!
1	Welcome to the USA, where logic and facts are debatable.
0	Welcome to the club. Enough is enough. The more people get natural immunity, the control goes away.
0/0	Welcome to the world of EXPERIMENTAL vaccines....good luck suckers.
1/-1	Well I am in the target group of Covid19 so I will leave a vapour trail, possibly a ‚ÄúSonic Boom‚Äù may be evident all the may to the vaccination point.
1/-1	Well I am sure many will be running to get theirs after seeing this
1/1	Well I and millions of others have been happy to take that risk. The AZ vaccine is based upon a more conventional approach to developing a vaccine, using repurposed' research data (based upon a Chimpanzee Adenovirus) which started several years ago, in developing a vaccine to combat Ebola. So the AZ vaccine has not been derived from any novel approach from a standing start. So I have a lot of confidence in AZ and how they have developed this vaccine. Its a very similar approach to how many other vaccines are developed and which we all have when we go on holiday to different parts of the world without any concerns. All medication carries a risk, even simple paracetomol, because all of us react to medication in different ways. But to be honest having a Covid vaccination is the only way out of this crisis whatever you think and the more people who have the vaccinations, the less opportunity the virus will have to mutate in to something much much worse. So I would encourage everyone to have the vaccination. The risk of getting Covid and being hospitalised and possibly dying, far outweigh the risk that the vaccines may trigger a negative reaction to it by our bodies.
1	Well I can report that I‚Äôve had the AstraZeneca vaccine this morning and it was painless and very well organised. No sign of any side effects yet (after 4 hours) nor have I turned into a WiFi hotspot. Rolling on the floor laughing #getthejab
1/1	Well I don't want to jinx it but it's been 12 hours since I had my second covid vaccine and I feel fine? This time after the first one I was bundled up in bed shivering.
1/1	Well I feel alittle better about getting it now.
0/0	Well I got my vaccine and it was the worst thing I‚Äôve ever done in my life!! No wonder people r hesitant. People should be hesitant!
1/1	Well I got the first dose of Pfizer and go back for second dose on the 28th. I had no side effects, just a little soreness where the injection went
1/1	Well I guess we‚Äôll just enjoy covid forever then...our country is full of anti-vaxxers and you‚Äôre not helping! I have a very small chance of being killed by a bus running me down every time I step outside, still go outside though, cause the benefits outweigh the risks...
1/1	Well I had the J&J shot and had symptoms from it at night and felt sick the next day but then after a week i was fine
1/1	Well I just caught Covid last week so I guess I have no choice but to wait for the vaccine now
1/1	Well I just got my 2nd COVID vaccine shot so so far so good. Hope you get this whole thing straightened out man.
1/1	Well I just lost another friend to the virus and she was only 48. I can't afford to get the virus as I am older with health issues. Getting the vaccine for me is the best choice. The virus could kill me. I don't care what the issues may be years down the road . I will be old then..
0/-1	Well I still don‚Äôt know or met anyone who‚Äôs caught this virus
1/1	Well I wasn‚Äôt going to tweet about it because it‚Äôs nothing millions of people haven‚Äôt done ... but I am too excited - I got my first vaccine shot today!!!!
0/0/0	Well I wont b takin vaccine coz i dont trust it
1/1	Well I'm getting my vax, and I was basically a hermit before Covid so I really couldn't care less if the world goes back to normal. Whether we reach herd immunity and go back to normal is entirely up to them. It's not gonna happen until enough ppl get vaxxed though. They don't seem to understand that.
1/1	Well I'm getting vaccinated and you will too if you want participate in society
0/0	Well I‚Äôm not going to trust you to inject me.
1/1	Well I‚Äôm ridiculously excited to be told I can have my first injection tomorrow evening. Wild horses wouldn‚Äôt stop me!!!
0/0	Well I‚Äôm sure why! It means the vaccines doesn‚Äôt work, even I child would qualify to answer that!
1/1	Well I‚Äôve had a lot of abuse on Twitter talking about vaccines but I am going to continue. You‚Äôre more likely to develop a blood clot from the oral contraceptive pill. The risk of you dying of COVID far outweighs that of getting a clot. RT if you‚Äôre having the vaccine.
1/1	Well at least our parents and grandparents were brave enough to take vaccines elimnating small pox and polio. We cannot even wear a mask so sad.
0/0	Well big pharma changed the definition of what a vaccine is, so now anything that‚Äôs therapeutic is a vaccine, and big pharma can now make billions
0/0	Well count me out. Thanks my guy lol.
1/1	Well despite the snow and wonderful driving conditions, I managed to get my Covid vaccine this morning!
0/0	Well done Canada. We, the rest of the world should do the same. Your body, your choice, no restrictions. The jab is not a vaccination. It don‚Äôt stop you catching it or passing it on. Your choice if you want chemicals or not.
1/1	Well done Israel, one of the few countries which took covid seriously
0/0	Well done Kate for speaking the truth. It's unbelievable how many people thought this jab was safe and are now dead.
1/1	Well done Novavax! Now let‚Äôs get this rolling out and help kick this pandemic squarely in its genomic nuts!
1/1	Well done all Countries. This is really hard for us all. Remember, none of us have total freedom until the majority of the World is vaccinated. Let's all help each other best we can?
1	Well done educational video to understand the purpose of vaccination so folks get anyone they're offered...............it needs to have more than 6 million views
0/0	Well done for mentioning alternatives other than vaccines, not.
1/1	Well done our government for getting a vaccine that doesn‚Äôt cost the earth too. Astra Zeneca are not making huge sums of money out of it, unlike other companies.
1/1	Well done to all the scientists for all their hard work. Onward and upwards into 2021
1/1	Well done to our fantastic scientists and all those involved, we need to move faster on executing this now
1/1	Well done to scientists & government for choosing the strategy in the face of fierce criticism
1/1	Well done!! I hope I get the chance to take this vaccine soon
1/-1	Well done, definitely the right thing to do
1/1	Well done. Thank you for the refresher on the importance of vaccinations.
1/1	Well either way I'm getting my first shot in two weeks so wish me luck.
1/1	Well everyone needs to get vaccinated to stop the spread, that's the only solution to wiping out these variants, make it law, get vaccinated or go to jail lol
0/0	Well for me personally I've never had a flu vaccine and I've never gotten the flu coincidence I think not
0/0	Well good for them. I‚Äôm not taking it. I‚Äôve never been jabbed with any of the vaccines and I don‚Äôt intend on starting now
0/0	Well good for them. I‚Äôm not taking it. I‚Äôve never been jabbed with any of the vaccines and I don‚Äôt intend on starting now.
1/1	Well he is truly an anti-vaccine dude because he refused to go to the hospital. What I don't understand are those antivaccine people going to the hospital. If you don't believe in science you shouldn go to the hospital just RIP.
1/1/1	Well i didnt get any problems and have 0 side effects mind boggling huh
0/0	Well i for one won't risk MY safety, why would I also risk an unborn child. So I will not get the vaccine.
1/1	Well i have a 11 month daughter my wife took i don't ever get sick but im taking it for her safety
1/1	Well if people r too stupid to vacinate , feel sorry for them and their families.
0/0	Well if people stopped getting vaccinated there'd be less people in the hospital and maybe this would finally go away...
1/-1	Well if you would rather take your chance with Covid than the vaccine that's up to you . I suppose its a case of weighing up the longterm unknown risks associated with taking the vaccine against the know risks of dying from Covid based on your age. I would rather have the vaccine as I have less chance of dying .
1/1	Well im not leaving my house till i get my vaccine. I was actually lookin forward to the vaccine so i didnt die from just being near someone. Looks like im going to be stuck in for another year -_-
1/1	Well is the Corona 19 virus safe, this time last year were you wishing there was a vaccine,well there is my mother is 96 in a retirement home she got both I asked her how it was she said a piece of cake son! My wife got both she is fine, my point is don't be afraid it is fine!
0/0	Well it is not FDA approved. It is still experimental. You have seen people getting severe side effects from it.
1/1	Well it would be nice to think that, specially when I am unable to make myself comfortable due to covid 19 illness - been ill for 8 days and this really blows
0/-1	Well mainstream media ain't to be trusted that's for starters
0/0	Well my mom started losing her hair so it must be a good thing right?
0/0	Well my wife got the vaccine and now has COVID, the vaccine doesn't work, it's a scam
0/0	Well my wife got the vaccine and now has COVID. I‚Äôve been doing apitherapy (bee sting therapy) and taking care of her while she‚Äôs ill. I‚Äôm testing negative the last week.
0	Well now they will make money in perpetuity, similar to the flu vaccine. Every year they will sell this crap.
0/0	Well ok if u want you take it, risk becoming an SCP
0/0	Well only a brain dead idiot would class the clot shots as safe. You have a vast Choice of potential illnesses to consider: myocarditis, strokes, etc, etc. I suppose you can hone in on your vaccine choice depending on which disability you would like to take a chance on. J&J would seem to have most chance of giving you myocarditis.. Here‚Äôs the damage after vaccination in the EU. The US is similar. The injuries and deaths are reported to be around 40 times underreported by academics. So the deaths may be as high as 1.5 million! The injuries come in then at an amazing 130 million. The US will be similar. This is a fucking joke right?A proper vaccine gives immunity for around 4 years. The J&J immunity wears off after 2 months! Pfizer after around 6. So you will need endless boosters, wheras natural immunity is longer lasting. So how do these vaccines boosters ( what a term ) handle variants? They don‚Äôt.Well Pfizer needs to jab kids with the clot shot in order to maintain their liability shield - translation they make $80 billion in revenue per annum, but pay out zilch, zero, nada to vaccine damaged people. If they did, they would be bankrupt in months. But at least the kids are safe. Nope.https://dailyexpose.uk/2022/01/12/20-facts-your-doctor-forgot-to-tell-you-about-vaccines/ Whereas Ivermectin can handle all phases of covid with no or near zero injuries or deaths ( from the ivermectin itsel ). Recently released DARPA documents:...... Japans huge decrease in covid cases after ivermectin usage. ( big Pharma with that Ferret Fauci killed off Hydroxychloroquine ( he previously recommended it ) and ivermectin as if they were shown to be viable treatments, then the Energency clot shots would not be allowed . Robert Malone estimated this cost 500,000 lives ). There needs to be a Nuremberg Court for all of these bastards who sold their soul to big Pharma. 12 were hung at the last one. A similar number need to be hung for Justice this time.
1/-1	Well presented - thank you!
1/0	Well respected journal the lancet published phase 1 and phase 2 trial results and say it produces sufficient antibodies in all patients. Phase 3 trials with 40 thousand people have begun.
1/1	Well said and agree that on above all and priority basis the health workers and older people should get vaccination. Definitely, there is logic and prioritization is fundamental to get control over and overcome the obstacles of covid 19.
1/1/1/1	Well said! I‚Äôm a school nurse and got the COVID 19 vaccine 11 days ago with no reservations. I‚Äôm working hard to keep my students and staff safe.
1/1	Well said. "Lifesaving vaccines shouldn't be auctioned off to the highest bidder. In a global pandemic like COVID, corporations must put people over profits." Universal Covid-19 vaccines for all.
0/0	Well sit down little sheep an listen...... BECAUSE THE MASK DO NOT WORK AN NEITHER DOES THE VACCINE....
0/0	Well still haven‚Äôt gotten one and never plan on it. Thanks for the report though
0/0	Well thank the heavenly FATHER who created us all to think of making us an immunity system to where u dont need a vaccine which is the virus and these demons are getting paid to infect u all even in the
0/-1	Well that should pretty much be a wrap on omicron then. If the vaccine can t prevent infection and the variant is barely killing anyone, there s essentially no point in getting a 4th.
0/0	Well that should pretty much be a wrap on omicron then. If the vaccine can‚Äôt prevent infection and the variant is barely killing anyone, there‚Äôs essentially no point in getting a 4th.
0/-1	Well that's awesome!
1	Well that's good but who knows how long it will be until it's rolled out to the public
1/1	Well that's really encouraging and enlightening. I may take vaccine.
1/1	Well the problem is that people tend to be egocentric rather than altruistic. There are always people who always lean onto what they believe in and the freedom to choose also adds up to it.
0/-1	Well the vaccine doesn‚Äôt prevent people from getting covid or spreading it. plus if you care to notice ... the more people get vaccinated with these experimental vaccines. the higher the variant cases get ! Welcome to year #2 of 2 weeks to flatten the curve. all for a virus they are telling you will be like any other annoying childhood illness
1/1	Well there vaccine can't be any worse the current mRNA vaccines.
0/0	Well they can shove it up that dark place as far as I am concerned, when asked about the over 65s as to the effectiveness of their so called wonder vaccine they answered in a typical vagueness well suited to a cheap skate politician... They did not have data on it in regards to the over 65s was their answer, in other words the jury was out on it but its safe to take it... a bit of a contradiction would be an understatement.
0/0	Well they just about got all the older people vaccinated so now they're saying its attacking kids so they can push to get them vaccinated..something isnt right with these vaccines..
1/1	Well this is convenient timing to have this recommended, I'm actually sitting in the waiting area after getting my first dose!
0/0	Well this vaccine will only help the body to tolerate the 5 g frequencyz more better...
0/-1	Well we don't vaccinate due to the vaccine inserts the majority of them list death and so on
0/0	Well yeah because it‚Äôs gene therapy and NOT a vaccine at all.
1/-1	Well, "socialist" government research funding laid the groundwork for the vaccine, before it was worth creating a startup to develop a product. And arguably, the distribution is failing because of a lack of "socialist"-style government planning, not because of red tape.
0	Well, COVID has the same symptoms as radiation poisoning, so if you get a vaccine that makes you more receptive to radio frequency, well, you will get sick more.
1/1	Well, I actually don't want to get this virus. It's pretty bad, and neither do I want to pass it on to anyone (even you). So I'll be getting a jab. Don't be so selfish.
0/0	Well, I can't be the only person scared shitless by these scientists giving it their best "reckon".
1/0	Well, I will take the vaccine if the pharmaceutical companies can be sued for disability or death caused by said vaccine
1/1	Well, I'm 67 years old and have multiple preexisting health conditions and I've been trying to get an appointment for the vaccine for three weeks and can't get an appointment through those sites and myturn.com
1/1	Well, I'm 67 years old and have multiple preexisting health conditions and I've been trying to get an appointment for the vaccine for three weeks and can't get an appointment through those sites and myturn.com and I haven't gotten anywhere. I've tried the phone number to although I don't have to because I am tech savvy. It's not us, it's L.A. County that doesn't have their shit together.
1/1	Well, I‚Äôm feeling absolutely fabulous today, more than 24hours after getting my initial #COVID19Vaccine dose. Make sure you have yours when it‚Äôs your turn, especially high risk communities
1/1	Well, at least more vaccines for us intelligent people!
0/0	Well, clearly the vax is racist and hates freedom.
0/0	Well, do what you want. Personally, me, never would I trust these people.
0/0	Well, for me these were not mild side effects, fever and chills and swearing? No, thanks, I won‚Äôt have it! Probably I had it already last February!
1/1/1	Well, have fun taking your chances everyone, I'm getting it. Really not a hard decision. You seem to be afraid of what you don't understand, but to me this really isn't scary at all. This is technology, and I'm taking advantage of it.
0/0	Well, here we are at that point in time where we have to fight for the right to NOT be injected with poison.
0/0	Well, if quite a few of your friends only had mild covid symptoms the second time around it's because they caught Delta the first time around and omicron the second. Nothing to do with having had the vaccine.
1/1	Well, if you don't get vaccinated.. Be prepared for that virus to target you. When we are all unavailable to it, it will seek a new host... Aka none vaxers.
0/0	Well, it is your choice but don‚Äôt tell me to do it!
1/-1	Well, it‚Äôs not like any of us expect anti-vaxx people to be smart
1/1	Well, maybe this would make some people be mentally able to drink Corona beer again.
0/0	Well, my friend was bedridden for three days from getting her vaccine. I‚Äôll pass.
1/-1	Well, she would rather get multiple injections of Botox on her face and lip fillers than getting the vaccine.
1/1/1	Well, thank you, good to know cause this is the vaccine that many of us will be probably receiving here in Spain. It's a relief. Let's just hope the South African variant won't become dominant and other more virulent variants won't appear
1/1	Well, the "enlightened folk" sure are having a fun time in the comments. I'm sure they be having an even better time when they're in mourning (heaven forfend).
0/0	Well, the vaccines are clearly safe. Great , when the companies state that they will be liable for all deaths ,myocarditis and other injuries then I will get mine.
1/1	Well, this vaccine is being made with world class technology, with the cooperation of many first world countries all sharing information and making a vaccine. If they release it to the public, it‚Äôs safe.
1/-1	Well, to personally answer the question, we just don't know. But all we DO know is that the pandemic is coming to a complete end soon enough with how things are going right now with COVID-19 cases on the decline right now.
0/0	Well, vaccine was 100% effective in killing a doctor from Brazil last year. Look at the history of vaccine. The 1st polio vaccine that went out to the kids in quartine died from the 1st batch of vaccines. The news is so biased not a single episode has been based. I want ingredients for vaccine and pros and cons.
0/0	Well, what they don‚Äôt do is stop infection, symptoms, or transmission. ‚ÄúYou had one job!‚Äù
1/1	Well.. at least most of the anti-vaxxers will die from their own choices.
1/1	Well...every vaccination make a few reactions,so its better have in my body any defens to fight againts virus...
1/1	Well...here in South Africa,some church leaders have secretly told their followers to reject vaccination.With some followers distributing the anti-vaccination instructions through text messages;WhatsApp or word of mouth.Since,these churches are based in poor communities,the rest of the community finds out about it.Then they begin to question vaccination,with some people deciding to avoid vaccination.
0/0	Welp - still not getting vaccinated
1/1	Welp the people who don‚Äôt want it will get covid and die sucks for them for being absolutely insane I just feel bad for them at this point
0/0	Went to lunch with a small group of relatives (8) when the subject of Covid vaccination came up and only one among us has gotten the vaccine. The other seven of us agreed we were not getting it under any circumstances.
0/-1	Were we not closer when there were no vaccines? Self deceit.
1/1	Western world; got the institutions with some of the smartest people on the planet with some of the most advance tech. Also western world; vaccine caused autism.
0/0	Weve got kids and adults are either damaged or have died from these Jabs and they still wont tell the truth.
0/0	We√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re better off watching the Simpson√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s, as their predictions are spot on !
0	We√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve had adverse reactions to vaccines before so we are not going to have anymore as the risk is worse on taking it than not taking it.
1/1	We‚Äôll be busy building antibodies! Be part of the solution and get your vaccine too!
1/1/1	We‚Äôre definitely picking up speed now.
1/1	We‚Äôre just building resistance, it‚Äôs all good!
1/1	We‚Äôre just thankful that we in our 90s and 60s got our 2 shots of Moderna last February and we‚Äôre alive and well and look forward to gathering with our fully vaccinated family and friends in the next few months without masks
0/1	We‚Äôre only as safe as our communities with the lowest vaccination rates.
0/0	We‚Äôre seeing fully vaccinated individuals getting Covid, plus you still have to wear a mask. So, what‚Äôs the point a false sense of protection.
0	We‚Äôre tired of this crap, enough is enough!!! Live with it, eat healthy and exercise. You‚Äôll be fine.
1/-1	We‚Äôve all heard you can‚Äôt get the flu from the flu shot, but why does it sometimes give you ‚Äúflu like symptoms?‚Äù The answer is in your immune response!
1/1	We‚Äôve become a nation of whiners and babies. Side effects, really? How about thank you to researchers who have worked tirelessly on this?
0/0	We‚Äôve had adverse reactions to vaccines before so we are not going to have anymore as the risk is worse on taking it than not taking it.
0/1	We‚Äôve reached critical mass: pejoratives like ‚Äúanti-vaxxer‚Äù and ‚Äúconspiracy theorist‚Äù no longer hold any weight. Joe Rogan (unintentionally) made the world realize that these words are mostly used to deflect from truth. They are panicking. Truth has caught up with their lies.
0/1	What !!!!! But they've bypassed the very one that they cannot /should not bypass (but HAVE) according to the Nuremberg Code. I just cannot believe this video. These people are actually publicly, happily, blatantly ignoring the Nuremberg Code. Previous trials for other covidviruses....all the animals died after a time.
0/0	What I do know is that I will not take it. Ivermectin is the answer not this Vac.
0/0	What I don't understand is how the vaccine immunity supposedly lasts buy natural immunity does not. ..that doesn't make sense to me
1/1	What I don't understand is if your child cannot be vaccinated due to adverse affects, why would you then advocate for anti vaccination? Your child is now a part of the group that relies on herd immunity...advocating for anti-vax just puts your own child at even more of a risk...
1/1	What I find funny is that if you show a scientist proof that he is wrong, he'll analyze it and change his mind. However proving antivaxx/homeopathy fans they're wrong simply reinforces their beliefs
1/1	What I find pretty odd is that people seem to worry a lot about possible long-term effects of a vaccine while worrying little about those of COVID-19.
1/1	What I got out of this was we should vaccinate not just the wealthiest nations to stop the pandemic. This sounds extremely intelligent and like a good plan
1/-1	What I hate about common sense is that some people might believe there is middle ground to science, when there is not.
1/1	What I learn. Anti vaxxers are more deadlier than virus.
1	What I liked about the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is the no tears after I shampoo my hair.,
0/0	What T F are you talking how can you guarantee it won't go to nucleaus.. only in ribosome.. how can you vouch for such theory.. it's just a theory.. .. you guys have no idea what can or cannot happen when you jab with mRNA vaccines... it's all being rushed.. and you guys will kill lot of people soon, Molecular cell biology is not that great.. nobody is so sure... there are zillions of things in it.. you cannot understand .. it's not like newton's laws.. this is damn complex... do not come and preach half ass science here..
0/0	What Utter Garbage!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is full of poisons, unknown material with unknown effects.
0/-1	What a LIAR
0/0	What a bozo... The executives of moderna are nonchalant about perpetrating the largest case of fraud the world has ever known.
0/0	What a crock! All this for an illness with an untreated survival rate of 99.9%, more so if treated early.
0/0	What a disgusting piece of propaganda trying to use peer pressure to push an untested medical experiment!
1/1/1	What a fantastic job all of the people who have had a part in creating this vaccine. Thank you for your efforts.
0/-1	What a glorious testament to human ingenuity!
1/-1	What a idiot , says it all about the ANTI VAXXERS
0/0	What a joke, J&J vaccines is paused and yet AZ vaccines merely changed the name and packaging intending to sell more, both vaccines have the same blood clotting issues! The intentions behind it is sadly obvious!
0/0	What a load of crap this all is, especially this channel itself, I don't trust vaccines
0/0	What a load of propaganda - "she's playing her part". That just demonises those who don't as 'not playing their' part' in keeping society safe. What game is the UN playing here. Let's not forget that it was the UN's cover up for China that contributed to the virus teaching pandemic proportions. The V sign I'm holding up is the British one, which means... This vaccine is too rushed. The UN can't say what is going to happen in the long run. More studies need to be done, but for the sake of business and profit, they are going ahead.
0/0	What a load of rubbish, how dare they guilt and criminalise people for making the own choice, and then try and take the choice away....
1	What a lot of people fail to realize is that they‚Äôve been working on a vaccine for many years before this for when this happened. I‚Äôm only 52 but I like my life and I want to keep living it so I‚Äôm vaccinated and nobody can make me feel bad about it! I‚Äôm no sheep, I just love myself and everyone around me more and bah bah bah if somebody wants to call me a sheep.
1/1	What a relief. My mother received her first dose on Saturday. She is 70, with COPD, and she has hunkered down for this entire pandemic. To think that, once the vaccine does its job, she can survive this virus as if it were a cold? Well, it is simply a huge relief.
0/0	What a surprise-and next week it will be "Why are people with 2 shots and 7 boosters being admitted to hospital?"Of course the answer will be because they haven't had their 8th.
1/1	What a trooper. A flu shot is really essential this year with the Covid pandemic. I will definitely be getting the Covid vaccine when that is available. Thank you for sharing
1/1	What a wonderful day I have just had my second vaccine Thankyou Sheffield for all your hard work Friendliness and expert care You are all wonderful!!!
1/1	What a wonderful sentiment and recommendation from one of the world‚Äôs experts who really knows and appreciates the miracle that these vaccines represent. I can only imagine how good the compliance would be if vaccinations were available for the Spanish Flu a century ago; a lot like the polio vaccine in the 1950s.
1/1	What a wonderful thing to do. Made me cry. 90 years young and wanting the vaccine . Awesome.
0/0	What a wrong decision. Greece should have learned a lesson from Israel. Most covid patients there have been fully vaccinated. Vax is not the answer. Get med if you are not well, not vax.
0/0	What about Billy gates nano chips injection king
0/-1	What about Tiffany Doven? Is she alive since she took it? Anybody knows if she is ok?
0/0	What about all the people around the world a lot in the US dieing shortly after having the vaccine, sweeping that under the rug are we?
0/0/-1/-1	What about all the people dying from vaccine Doc? All of you will be held liable.
0/0	What about all the people that are having major reactions, with some dieing from these vaccines?
0/-1	What about all the scientist that were banned off YouTube for having the wrong "scientific" opinion on the "pandemic". Is YouTube a great arbiter of scientific fact?
0/0	What about animal studies where the animals with Mrna vaccine got a cytokine storm. And the animals got very sick or die.
0/0	What about long term side effects from the vaccine ....
0/0	What about people who already have autoimmune disorders? Does that increase the risk of the mRNA "vaccine" causing adverse reactions? Without proper data, I'm going to avoid the "vaccine" on that risk alone.
0/0	What about protection from naturral immunity? Most people who aren't vaxed have had the virus and have more protection that the vaccinated. Honestly ... Does anyone read?
0/0	What about risks of long term side effects?
0/0	What about the 'DYING' 'side effect' is that normal too then?
1/0	What about the 130,000 people that died
0/0	What about the 99% pre vaccine COVID infections who didn't require hospitalization?. You're assuming because I have been vaccinated I avoided hospitalization. But since I'm not anywhere near the high risk or even medium risk that without the Jab I would have been?
0/1	What about the Russian vaccine? I can't seem to find scientific papers about it (just political-biased news) and it's the only one that's coming soon to my country. Plus there are news talking about renal and circulatory problems that happened to people in the test phases that they kept in secret until now. That's not that alarming but it is pretty unconfortable to decide about getting a vaccine with that kind of doubts.
0/0	What about the cdc saying 15000 people have died from these vaccines?
0/0	What about the fact that they are discriminating, they only recognise a certain strain‚Ä¶.the issue is that all other types of pathogens and cancers are left to grow unmonitored by our now natural immunity being dampened down.
0/-1	What about the fraudulent pandemia !?
0/0/0/0	What about the ingredients? Never hear about them. No thank you!
0/0/0	What about the man that died from it right after getting it today in the media idk if it happened today or yeaterday n he wasnt old that I know of
0/0	What about the nano technology particles in the vaccination and the long term safety implications of nano particles in the human body and for what reason .
0/0	What about the ones who took the vaccine and died? People also died from taking the vaccine.
0/0	What about the people who are vaccinated and still dying for covid-19 .. no one wants to talk about that. I guess blame.it.on unvaccinated people
0/-1	What about the people who got it, got over it and have the antibodies?... Why would you need the vaccine if you already have the antibodies?..
1/1	What about the possible long-term side effects of not getting vaccinated? DEATH!!
0/0	What about the stories of babies who have a life of suffering after a vaccine? What about toddlers who cease speaking and develop autism after a vaccine? Did you know that 1 in 30 children in California are autist? And that 10 years ago it was 1 in every 1000? Did you know that the same symptoms of mercury poisoning are the same as autism?
0/0	What about them saying get the vaccine and you can go back to normal life
0/0	What about those cases in Norway where 23 people died after getting the jab?
0/-1	What about those that have got long covid symptoms post vaccine, which are now called post vaccine long haulers??
1/0	What age group is eligible now in almost March 2021?
1/1	What an incredible scientific breakthrough. It‚Äôs amazing we have access to this life-saving medicine.
1/1	What annoys me more than anything is who‚Äôs footing the bill for these people who don‚Äôt want the vaccine, but expect others to foot the huge medical costs for their defiance. This isn‚Äôt about personal freedom. It‚Äôs about living. If you die because you‚Äôre stubborn, that‚Äôs not about freedom. It‚Äôs about others stopping you as well. We‚Äôve had vaccines for years that have helped end some of the most serious things out there. I don‚Äôt get why people think this is different.
1/1	What annoys me the most is that Melissa is anti-vax because her daughter can't get vaccinated so her daughter actually relies on herd immunity to not get seriously sick. Yes there are certain cases where vaccines are bad for a specific person but in my opinion I believe that this is all the more reason to be pro-vax because then you rely on herd-immunity to survive.
1	What anti-vaxers don‚Äôt get is that the chances of dying from Covid are MUCH higher than dying from the vaccine
1/1	What anti-vaxxing is bad I never knew this It's not like vaccines are a theoretical suit of power armour or anything Lmao But seriously I don't understand why people don't vaccinate It's like going to a casino but not collecting any rewards you make It's just Stupid
0/0	What are the benefits of getting a COVID-19 vaccine? Absolutely NONE; vaccine is detrimental to your spiritual and physical health; forgive me.
0/0	What are the long term effects? What about what it does to pregnant women and their babies? Oh wait, we don‚Äôt know what‚Äôll happen yet.
0/0	What are the long term side affects, oh, wait no one knows
0/0	What are the long term side effect? We do not know yet. We don't know what would happen in a year or 2. Or 10, 20 years. They don't even know if it will stop you from getting the virus.
0/0	What are the true ingredients of covid vaccine? Me & my family won't be taking it!
0/0	What are they doing with the DNA? The AstraZeneca people came out with 1st without testing.im not taking any of the crap!!!!
0/0	What are we rats used for tests and having no control over our selves. Choose your poison. None fore me please!
0/1	What are you all afraid of? It is not us who ask questions that are afraid. We don't non comply because we are scared...it's quite the opposite really. Much harder to watch the masses become storm troopers than it is to wear a mask
1/1	What are you going to do if people start dropping dead from the virus? Take the vaccine
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	What concerns me is that safety tests can only test for known problems, unknown problems are only revealed by time.
0/0	What did i say? This has been over, i proved atleast 1 death from vaccine, we can conclude its not 100 % safe or necessary ..
1/1	What do anti-vaxxers and Russian roulette players have in common? They risk their lives.
0/0	What do we truly know about this trial vaccine of poison absolutely nothing
0/-1	What do you have to say about astra Zenica‚Äôs vaccines being stopped in a few countries due to blood clotting issues. All who had this issue were healthy with no immune issues and no other health concerns so is this something to be concerned about?
1/1	What do you want us to do? Stay locked up indoors? Any person will take their chance to rid society of this pandemic by taking the vaccine. It‚Äôs killing the people not just medically but socially, mentally, physically, financially and emotionally.
0/0	What does vaccine do that immune system doesn't do?
1/1	What doesn‚Äôt kill you mutates and tries again
0/-1	What ever happen to " to each their own"? Or "my body my choice"?
1/1	What ever happened to "If it save one life"
0/1	What ever happened to herd immunity through letting your immune system do it‚Äôs job
1/1	What evidence do you have to support that the vaccines are unsafe? Each vaccine has minor side effects and a couple have adverse reactions. This is a very small number. Covid-19 has killed millions and its mutations are killing more, every day. Which do you choose? A strong chance of no Covid thanks to a vaccine or Russian roulette with Covid-19
0/-1	What exactly is the vaccine supposed to be for? If it really works, then why do people still need to take such precautions?
1/1	What gets me is the ‚Äúin my opinion, I think it was developed too fast.‚Äù Bitch, what the fuck do you think progress is? ‚ÄúIt took years to develop x,y,z vaccine‚Ä¶‚Äù Yes, and people people used walk up to a tv to change the channel! Remember TV Guide?! I had to fucking TIME when to watch shows! Now I watch any show I want on the toilet at work! It‚Äôs called PROGRESS!
0/-1	What goes into ones body should be a matter of self choice and not force! Regardless of whatever the consequence, that is the bedrock of the human choice, God given free-will and the right of every human being.
0/0	What good is a vaccine that is supposed to especially help the frail and vulnerable if it kills them.
0/0	What happened to .....My body, my choice! I guess they conveniently forgot that line now that the narrative doesn‚Äôt fit the agenda.
0/1/-1	What happened to flu season, no more ,it's gone.
0/0	What happened to the JVCI RECONMENDATION NOT VACCINATE CHILDREN HOPE THESE PARENTS DONT LIVE TO REGRET THERE ACTIONS
0/-1	What happened to the immune system God gave us to fight off viruses? My hope is the covid will settle down during the spring just like the cold/flu season do.
1/1/1/1	What happened to trusting the scientific community and your doctors?
0/0	What happens if u take the vaccine and something bad happens....u can't sue them.
0/0	What happens when you take a perfectly healthy body with a great immune system and inject it with things like formaldehyde, polysorbate 80, human DNA, pig, dog and monkey DNA and live viruses? The answer is not ‚Äúit makes the body healthier and stronger‚Äù.
0/0	What has happened to people? This is inhumane. Totally sickening, we are talking about a jab for a virus with a 99.97% recovery rate and an IFR the same as flu, not the plague! It certainly is NOT about the jab but about complete control of the plebs.
0/-1	What has science ever done for us? TV Off.
1/1	What i Dont understand, whats wrong with a 2second COVID-19 Jab, yes they aren't sustainable.However, they have been effective with lowing the ommission of the spread of COVID.

0/0	What if the vaccine shows its side effects after 5-6 years? A vaccine needs decades to be considered safe, and we can't even sue the vaccine company. And now it's getting mandatory, I'm so out of clue
0/0	What if the vaccine they're rushing to make is the thing that causes the REAL pandemic?
0/1	What if you find out 5-10 years later if it does major organ damage? You cant sue them. Govt has provided vaccine companies with liability protection. So you are screwed!
0/0	What if you have an underlying autoimmune condition? I'm concerned about vaccines triggering a flareup.
0/0	What if your unvaxed and at home with Covid but feel fine? Your vaccines don‚Äôt work.
0/0	What is a computer nerd doing in this video, pretending to be an medical expert? My guess is, because he's the biggest vaccin market manipulator and covid-spreader in the world.
1/1	What is a vaccine ? Vaccine is : death virus ( basicly ) Why we need it ? There is no medicine yet effected to this virus ; our only wappon is our anticors ! And when we got vaccineted , our body learns the new virus and starts making anticors... so we got ummin What if we dont get vaccinated ? Then we will meet the original virus ! And our body will start producing anticors also , but this will take time and will be after the virus gets all over the body.. Can we still survive ? Yes of course ! %99 ! But if u get vaccinated , your body will learn the virus and yor chance will be : %99.99 What about side effects ? There will be side effects , like all the other vacvines ! And now my question : what about the side effects of the real virus ? After they stay in yor body for weeks , after they conqouer yor livers , vines , throat ! Have u ever though about the side_effects of the covid 19 ? Anyway.. the choise is yors.
0/0	What is going on in the world, is truly bizarre! To the extent that in just the past few short months, all virology and immunology textbooks ever printed in existence, are being re-written as we speak, the premise to all empirical scientific methodology, logic and reason.
0/0	What is going on right now, is known in epidemiology as the pathogen endemic equilibrium phase, (viral stasis) and is perfectly normal. Virulence weakening and dilution is what always happens when mutations and naturally acquired herd immunity is occurring throughout the populations. Invariably mutation causes infection rate increase and lethality rate decrease. Vaccination at this stage, is essentially pointless.
1/-1	What is hidden in the propagation of the right to self-harm is not only that the general public has to pay for it in terms of costs, but that all the caring people who are then needed because one has damaged oneself have to shoulder the rucksack of the failures.
0/0	What is potentially dangerous: rushing the approval process, then rolling it out admitting you are not sure how effective it will be, and admitting you need to measure the results on UK population before affirming fully its effectiveness. Covid vax scepticism is healthy.
0/1	What is scaring me is in a google search any alternative views about the vaccine are being filtered out. Maybe we need to remember the HIV Aids crisis. That has never gone away, people just manage to live with it. There is no cure

0/0	What is sense taking vaccine if it does not guaranty anything. A local male got paralyzed after taking vaccine.
0/0	What is stopping me from getting the shot at this point is when I research how many people have DIED from the vaccine the information is not there. I‚Äôll read something and the next day it will be gone. I‚Äôm actually scared of the vaccine more than covid.
1/1	What is taking so long? How can you sit on the sideline because 1 person died from a theory while thousands are dying everyday while you‚Äôre analyzing out an abundance of caution. Move it!
0/0	What is the benefit of the vaccine when people are still getting infected even after taking it. UNICEF, does this vaccine guarantee a safeguard against the virus? If not, stop fooling innocent people.
1/1	What is the big deal about vaccines...of any sort. Why not remember vaccines that saved lives many years ago...polio, small pox, tuberculosis, yellow fever, etc. These anti vaxxers...bored rabble with nothing better to do.

0/1	What is your age? My mother is 58 and took the vaccine 4 days ago, she‚Äôs experiencing soreness and a lot of fatigue. Immediately after the vaccine she reported dizziness. I‚Äôve definitely noticed the decline in her energy and loss of focus since then
1/1	What is your expected life span? Not 30, like the middle ages ? It's because of medical scientists, such as these doctors
0/0	What it concern me the most is it lowering lymphocytes T, B (fight cancer cells) mitocondria and high level of D-Dimer (sign of thromboses). FIFA did not find the cause of 108 player death in less than 6 months, and most collapse on the field.) All vaxxin.

0/0	What kind of idiot take a shot that clearly still in it‚Äôs experimental stage that has countless reports of adverse effects and calls the people wanting to wait for more data idiots? Idiot is the person who willingly replaces his common sense with fear. We have about one year of data on the covid vaccine whereas we have about 90 years of data on the flu vaccine. Do not compare them. They‚Äôre not the same. One is proven safe. One is not.
0/0	What kind of vaccine is only effective for you when someone else takes it?
0/0	What losers would give the covid vaccine to their children.
1/1	What matters after the single dose is not the number of cases, but the number of severe infections. If one dose prevents 100% of hospitalizations and deaths from covid that is more than adequate.
0/1	What most people fail to understand is, vaccines are only a way to infect some one with a virus. The difference between that and natural infection is it is manufactured and deemed to be safe.
1/1	What needs to be done is to make the vaccine mandatory for all people living in the US.

0/0	What people don't understand is that Western Medicine is built for profits not cures. Just imagine if every disease and illness known to man is cured. How will these pharmaceutical, CDC and FDA make their money??? So remember this when you go to a doctor or deal with insurance companies or medication all of this are made for profits only. No one ever in the history of medicine talks about boosting the immune system the frontline to fighting off bacteria and viruses. These drugs that put out in the markets are designed purposely to have side effects to keep you depending on Western Medicine.
1/1	What people don‚Äôt seem to get is that if you are low risk and not personally worried about Covid, when given the choice, you are more likely to choose a better vaccine. Pfizer/Moderna are both higher effectiveness and come with no bad press. Can anyone actually say if they had a choice between AZ and one of the above they are choosing AZ? It offers no advantages. I am pro-vaccine. People also need to understand that wanting to get the best vaccine is not that crazy a concept.
0/0	What people learn from history, is that people never learn from history. I'm not taking any mRNA created from eugenicists
0/0	What percentage of the vaccines were fabricated immorally? All 3 approved by the USDA were fabricated immorally. Do the right thing, not the evil selfish thing.
0/0	What really annoys me about the media is the whole ethical issue, trying to emotionally blackmail people. But forget that it is highly unethical to force people to have treatment that they don‚Äôt want! We all have a right to decide what to do with our own bodies and should not be discriminated against.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	What scares me most about this is there is a No Liability Clause which means I cant sue them and recieve compensation for any damages that might be caused by this even up to death
0/0/0/0	What should scare you even more is it‚Äôs changing your RNA; your bodies blueprint and the changes are permanent and irreversible. Gates wants to depopulate by 3 billion. He plans on doing this with vaccines.

1/1	What so many anti vaxers choose to ignore is that most of them are enjoying healthy lives because of the childhood vaccination programmes.
1/1	What sucks is that some won't get it because they're doubting it or they're conspiracy theorists. Humans suck
0/0	What surprises me most is that when patients get serious side effects after the first dose and that doctors will then still recommend the second dose...
0/0	What the f***!!! Big pharma should test their mRNA vaccines with these two pathetic weirdos. They are creepy as hell. Now I'm really really scared.
0/0/0	What the hell is going on bowing down on earthly things.No one on earth will escape death.everyone will go through the same process so believe the creator of humans and not vaccines.
0/-1	What the professionals are not saying is that when you've already had the covid you do not need the vaccine as you already have the ANTIBODIES. And is Been proven through studies the ANTIBODIES stay with us for life. Also, even on the CDC website, which keeps on changing of course because Dr Faucci keeps on changing his "opinion", it says people with preexisting condition and compromised immune system, as well as pregnant women should not take the vaccine. I've had the ANTIBODIES for over a year already, through which my doctor found out i had the virus even after a tested negative twice, and although I go through lingering symptoms, I'm fine. As well as many of my large family. I would if anything, recomend to take the ANTIBODIES test instead of taking the vaccine.
0/0	What the use of getting the injection when you can still get the virus and also transmit it to others
1/1	What these people don‚Äôt understand is yes, your child may have had a bad reaction to a vaccine so in cases like those, of course they shouldn‚Äôt be getting vaccinated, but that‚Äôs why people who don‚Äôt have reactions should be vaccinated, so that the people who aren‚Äôt able to, like your child, are protected
1/0	What truly terrifies me is that after years of hysteria, many people still do not actually know what covid is and what vaccines do and that the vaccine fanatics are the least educated group.

Lord thank you for now the United States and the entire world to be vaccinated will be a miracle... . We are going to be on our way to being Covid- free. Remember to continue in using the masks.. But Pray to the CREATOR to Protect you and your loved ones every day and night...
1/-1	What would be convincingly ‚Äúsafe‚Äù though? 40,000 subjects and 0 deaths? 1,000,000 subjects and 2-3 deaths? Absolute safety is really hard to prove. The risk in the meantime is your chance of getting Covid before you get vaccinated multiplied by your chance of getting long term side effects or dying from Covid, and then multiply those same risks for whoever you might spread it to. There is some risk in waiting for longer term data. I would get it if offered (and FDA cleared) as my wife and I are both high occupational exposure, but she‚Äôs pregnant and we have a toddler too so they won‚Äôt be getting it anytime soon.
1/1	What would be really cool is if these vaccines reached around the whole world to the point many of these viruses would go extinct.
0/0	What would be the purpose of a vaccine for something with a natural survival rate of nearly 100%?
0/0/0/0	What you NEED to know is that NOBODY knows the long term effects.
1/1	What you are doing is truly dangerous. If this virus is not controlled utilizing real medical science & research the situation we are in could last for years. It was tested thoroughly. It is being rolled out in phases. Allow it to work. This is bigger than your show & ratings.
0/0	What you really need to know is that a very high percentage of medical staff won't take these deadly vaccines.
0/0	What you were saying goes against what science has proven over and over and over again natural immunity is better than a vaccine. Every time.
1/1	What's amazing is that vaccines have been so good at protecting us that some people forgot how great they are. They just think, oh it's just a flu when it's literally malaria, one of the world's greatest killers.
1/0	What's concerning to me is long term sustainability.
0/0	What's dangerous is those who don't even consider anything outside the info. they are given by Govt and the vaccine companies. Vaccines companies are in this to make a huge profit and help the Gov. agenda. That's it. This is why Gates moved away from computer software.
0/0	What's going in America is the result of OVER-VAXXING people which reboot & ramp up the Covid & Flu infection rates following each jab for a vicious cycle as people drop off the map along the way. Then, it's onto serving People costly monopolized Covid pills as the antidote on the other hand for their side-effects or symptoms. It will take a world of people to insist on stopping this madness (since Covid will Never Be Eradicated). People are not up for being abused & all. Warp-Speed Drugs are allow so many to capitalize or get-rich off of all this. They are taking advantage of the Obamacare Medical insurance Policy to milk taxpayers $$ and Federal $$$ for all its worth (even if that comes at the expense of harming People's businesses, jobs; lives, health or immune system).
0/0	What's in the vaccines Joe? The media covers up the disaster side effects they cause. Help the unvaccinated help the children who are innocent.
0/0/0/0	What's not to trust about a for profit, already paid for, rushed vaccine? I'll hold off and let others be the real world testers thank you.
0/-1	What's the long term effects from taking all these vaccines? Everybody seems to be rushing to get the most vaccine. Looks odd

0/0	Whatever is in the jab can‚Äôt be undone after you take it, no fda certification, no long term testing, people still getting COVID after getting the jab, many side effects reported, many deaths etc and the government wants to mandate this thing?
1/1	Whatever it was it wasn't the vaccine.
1/0	Whatever we call it, it substantially reduces the severity of the disease. Isn't that enough reason to get it? No? How about unburdening hospitals (and staff) so other people can get care for non-covid problems?
1/1	Whatever your vaccine is, as long as it is approved by WHO and it is anti-covid, it is okay. I was given sinovac and will be receiving my second dose next month.
1/1	Whatever, as long as the vaccine keeps my chances of a serious illness at 0% I‚Äôll get it every year like I do the flu shot

1/0	When Anti-Vaxxers refuse they vaccine they must also be made to sign a waiver that neither them or any of their family will receive treatment by the NHS when they catch COVID-19, and they are locked in quarantine until they die/recover. Simples!
1/1/1	When I call high risk patients with COVID, I am so relieved when I hear they had a prior vaccine. If it is one dose or two, Pfizer or moderna, time and time again, their symptoms seem milder. In some cases, it likely saved their life. Get vaccinated when you have the chance.
0/0	When I can see documented studies outlining long term effects, I‚Äôll consider it. Until then, I will pass.
1/1	When I caught Covid, it was terrible but I never had to consider the ER. I have an autoimmune disease and COPD. I‚Äôm so glad I got vaxxed. My daughter didn‚Äôt catch it. Yes!
1/1	When I get my second vaccination it will be on my grindr profile and I'm very OK with that.
1/1	When I get on a plane I want a qualified pilot. When I go the dentist I want a qualified dentist. When I get my boiler serviced I want a qualified gas engineer ‚Ä¶. When I want to protect myself and loved ones against a virus I don‚Äôt however want thousands of qualified viral epidemiologists with decades of experience all saying the same thing and backed by qualified medical experts in other field all over the world. Instead I want a bunch of unqualified fed up people without even the basics in school level biology to tell me how complicated science they don‚Äôt understand is in reality a hoax. .. yep, that makes sense

1/1	When I think that some people still question the effectiveness of vaccination If we had the contamination figures with Omicron without vaccines, it would be a hecatomb‚Ä¶ Vaccines save lives, and prevent severe forms of the disease, including in children
1/1	When I was in elementary and had an epidemic of dengue fevers in my country, a doctor said to me. "Prevention is more better that treating diseases" It is true that there is no vaccine for dengue but I still hold the doctor comments about it.
1/1	When I was in the army part of my job was to teach our soldiers about biological warfare and why vaccines are mandatory for soldiers. I had a soldier who was an anti-vaxer, hadn't had her children vaccinated. After one of my classes she came up to me with a long list of questions about vaccines, I was not able to answer all of them but what I did was call one of our medics to join the conversation, after that she made an appointment with a doctor on base to get her children vaccinated. Sometimes what it takes is showing the worst case scenarios and then having an open and honest discussion with people.
0/0	When I was young, one of my friends woke up paralyzed from the waist down one morning after receiving a vaccine. I think vaccines are great, but there's no way in hell anybody will force me to take one that I don't want. I think I'll let the rest of the world get the Covid vaccine, then there will be reputable data to base my decision to either get it or not on.

1/1	When a person dies of covid, the conspiracy nutjobs will immediately blame poor health and not the virus. However, if a vaccinated person dies for any reason, they'll blame the vaccine and nothing else. This is how you can tell that the conspiracy nutjobs are really desperate and I love it.
1/1	When a person has spent months and months making fun of people who take precautions and spreading lies which are likely causing deaths, they don't deserve a ton of respect just for dying. Dying doesn't change the fact that their behavior in life was likely appalling.
1/1	When a population takes vaccines, it leads to a herd immunity effect.
1/1	When a safe and effective vaccine is found, COVAX (led by WHO, GAVI and CEPI) will facilitate the equitable access and distribution of these vaccines to protect people in all countries
1/1	When a scientist tells me that the research says it would be helpful to my comfort and wellbeing to take a vaccine, I'm going to take it. And I would urge my constituents and all others who may have any confidence in my opinion to please follow the scientists and get vaccinated.
1/1	When a second booster becomes necessary I will get a J&J. I‚Äôve had 2 Pfizers and a Moderna. It seems like each shot has a particular strength.
0/0/0	When a vaccine is safe and effective you don‚Äôt need to promote it no?
1/1	When a vaccine works perfectly it prevents vaccinated individuals from being sickened by the disease, and it also prevents them from transmitting the virus to others.

1/1	When it comes to vaccines it‚Äôs important to not allow perfect to be the enemy of good. All indications are that we now have several very good vaccines that can save many lives. While none of them are 100% effective against a mutating virus they are still very powerful weapons that should eventually allow us to get back to some semblance of normalcy.

0/0	When people ask you why you don't get your vaccine, simply respond: The same reason as you, to help people
1/1	When people behave like children and refuse to voluntarily take their vaccinations, thereby putting the most vulnerable people in their society at unacceptable risk of grave illness and worse, they must then be treated as children.
0/-1	When people fear the "cure" more than the,so called,Pandemic...

0/0	When pharmaceutical reporters are praising something, then I guess that qualifies as an advertisement.
1/1	When presented with an opportunity for a vaccine, don‚Äôt wink at it, grab the opportunity. It could be the difference between life and death.
0/0	When searching for truth, always follow the money trail. Natural immunity has no profit margin, therefore, will be ignored in favor of vaccines that do not prevent reinfection and is still infectious to others. More importantly, enormous profits from vaccine sales for the "illness profit centers" and big pharma, is always the motive.
1/-1	When she gets covid she change her mind there is a pandemic
0/0	When someone is out of shape, overly toxic, and generally unhealthy‚Äîvaccines are of no use. When someone is fit, clean, and generally healthy‚Äîvaccines are of no need.
0/0	When someone says "just because it's safe" in regards to an experimental vaccine should give us pause. Remember DDT was "safe"!
1/1	When someone suddenyl become knowledgable about how vaccine can be developed just by google searching stuff. And then dismiss all valid scientific evidences.. Yea you have the right for your opinion but science is not based on Opinions but on facts and evidences and discrediting years of research and such is soooo bafflinf at best.
0/1	When someone who was PCR "positive" for Covid dies in a motorcycle accident: they say "+1 covid 19 death". When someone dies just after getting the Covid "vaccine" they say "he would have died anyway, just a coincidence, not the vaccine".

0/0	When this experiment Fails ... Who will take responsibility ?
1/1	When this is all over the UK people will be thanking the goverment for their Covid rollout program which got the country back on its feet long before anyone else. The EU will be looking at themselves and asking some very serious questions about their own response. Rightly so too when lives are at risk.
0/0	When those who are vaccinated feel they are at risk from those who are not vaccinated reveals that they have no confidence in the vaccine. So why did they get vaccinated?

1/1	When will you roll out the 3rd booster shots for 15 to 17 year olds so I can take it?
1/1	When you are offered vaccination ACCEPT it. I come from a time when polio was still a scourge and none of my friends, or I, had the chance of a ' jab ': some were left with marked deformation, I was lucky with just a thinner left leg and shoulder higher than the other. Unfortunately my being canted to the right was a major factor in my spinal problems as I grew older, resulting in major surgery in my 30s.

0/0	When you eat healthy and have a strong immune system your body can fight any virus. There is no need for a vaccine.
0/0	When you finally understand that it's not about health but about money, a vaccine costs 30 euros.
1/1	When you get a vaccine it‚Äôs a less severe form of Covid 19 that lets your body produce antibodies for it so if you ever do come into contact with someone who has Covid you will be able to fight it off I‚Äôm pretty sure

1/1	When you think the average IQ is below 100 it's not a surprise that there are literally millions of idiots who will believe the anti-vaccine nonsense.
0/0	When you told me that I would not spread the virus if I had the vaccine, I was confident in your research. Literally 2 months after my second shot, that all changed and I lost the confidence in your research.
1/1/1/1	When you vaccinate yourself but not your children, you're just selfish
1/1	When you weigh the risk of the vaccine vs. the risk of the virus, it is obvious that you should get the vaccine.
0/0	When you're forcing well-meaning adults to do something they don't want to do, you're the bad guy. Always. No exceptions. Joe Biden is a bad guy, his entire administration are made up of bad people, and I hope the American people make it loud and clear that they will not be forced, threatened, or intimidated into doing things they do not want to do. This is the United States of America, a country founded on the values of Liberty and Justice. This is not a dictatorship, nor is it a cage full of rats in a laboratory. Protest. Go on strike. Be vocal. Say no.

0/0	Where I live it's become mandatory. I'm terrified as I know people who have had vaccine injury and as a diabetic I worry that I might get a bad reaction. There are just so many vaccine injured citizens and mainstream media isnt reporting it and why not?? Knowing too much sometimes makes it more frightening.
0	Where I live, they've fired healthy, unvaccinated nurses and doctors and let COVID POSITIVE, vaccinated ones work... how much sense does THAT make?
0/0	Where I live, which is the state of Mississippi, we have the most sick children in America. And we are one of only three states where vaccines are forced if you want your children to actually go to school. We are the one state with the most sick children and we are the state who gives the most vaccines.
1/1	Where can I get one? I'm in Washington
1/1	Where can one get it? Obviously I want to prioritize medical professionals and people who are at risk first but for the average Joe where/when can I get info on the availability?

0/0	Where did you get the live virus from? Unless u are harvesting it and the culprit of murdering 1000s of people
1/1	Where do I sign up?!?!?!
0/0	Where do you get the "90 to 94%" efficiency rates? No vaccine ever has such a high rate of protection. As these vaccines are in the experimental phases we can't make such assessments. Heavily vaccinated countries show high rates of infection. The only observable effects of the vaccines is a dampened down hospitalisation rate. I think these figures have been manipulated by various agencies who benefit financially from the sale of these vaccines.
0/0	Where does the spike protein come from? Where are the amino acids derived from? And the immortal human cells are from? Somewhere along the line fetal stem cells were used in the development of these vaccines, and we STILL don‚Äôt know EXACTLY from what and how it is made, but fun graphics anyway.

1/1	Where there is a will, there is a way. Well done to all concerned.
1/1	Where vaccines differ from the other things you listed is that if you‚Äôre vaccinated your probability of transmitting the disease gets lower as well. It‚Äôs not just a personal decision it also affects everyone you meet or even people that shop at the same stores as you. Getting vaccinated helps protect others, not just yourself
0/0	Where's the REAL Science the one that tells us the truth?
0/-1	Where's the commercial for this vaccine with the fancy name and all the side effects whispered quickly?
0/0	Where's their masks at moment I'm not convinced about vaccine will be a while before I get mine so plenty time to decide and still let people in and out country
1/1	Wherever you are, you can continue to protect our people by getting a COVID-19 vaccine and booster.
1/1	Whether or not these vaccines have full FDA approval does not change the fact that getting covid is a far greater risk than getting vaccinated. That much is very clear.
1/1	Whether some side effects may or may not occur, I do believe the pros will outweigh the cons, and I will rather have side effects, than to end up dying from COVID-19.
0/-1	Whether you are ‚Äúleft‚Äù ‚Äúright‚Äù ‚Äúpro vax‚Äù ‚Äúanti vax‚Äù ‚Äúpro lockdown‚Äù ‚Äúanti lockdown‚Äù. We need to stand together against vaccine passports. They are not the way to get your freedoms back. It will be exactly the opposite!! Be careful what you wish for. Think of our kids future.
1/-1	Whether you believe or dont believe in masks anyone who shoots someone over a mask is insane.
0/0	Whether you like it or not, the COVID vaccine is one of the most dangerous vaccines ever created. It doesn't matter how bad the pandemic is, if you force that vaccine on people and they're injured or killed, that makes you guilty of crimes against humanity.
1/1	Whether you‚Äôre a Pfizer Princess, Moderna Mam√≠, or Johnson Jawn, shout out to you for taking care of your health
0/0	Which is more reprehensible? Allowing those who do not want the vaccine (sometimes for good reasons) to return to a normal life, or injecting a vaccine into people who come under duress and can therefore no longer give free and informed consent?
0/0	Which is why you don‚Äôt see hardly any of them speaking out against the jabs.... they probably own tons of stock in these companies... which should be illegal and shows that all these branches of gov colluded... wonder if Supreme Court justices own any of those stocks or any in dominion ... just a thought.
0/0	Which parent wants to risk their teen son to risk of myocarditis with unknown long term potential heart condition. With the near less than 2 % of teens getting infectious COVID cases being , very , very low. Unless something we don‚Äôt know yet.
0/0	Whichever way they spin it, the simple facts are the corona vaccine doesn't really work but there's too much money riding on it, they have to push it.
1/1	While COVID-19 vaccines were developed rapidly, all steps were taken to make sure they are safe and effective
1/0	While I appreciate that the vaccines were fast tracked. It seems based on the millions worldwide who have been vaccinated over the past 6 months, and the statistically small number of issues people have experienced, there is enough "evidence" about their safety and efficacy. I'd rather get vax'd and reduce my possibility of death and long term health risks, than go unvax'd and risk death and chance of taking others with me on the way out. Vaccines are a less potent version of a virus that enables your immune system to more successfully fight it off. If you have an issue with the safety of vaccines, then you should also have an issue with not wearing a mask. Getting vax'd seems a lot safer than living in the unmasked South. You're getting exposed either way. Same experiment, just different controlled level of risk.
1/1	While I do have faith in the Covid vaccine, it‚Äôs disheartening to see that a comedian that gets high and talks about monkeys and aliens on his podcast is managing to undermine the entire medical industry. I hope the industry can find a way to gain back more faith from the general populous.
1/1	While I'm happy and fortunate to be part of the first 8% nationally to get the #COVID19Vaccine , let's hope the next 62% needed for #HerdImmunity do not need to wait many months! #VaccinesWork

1/-1	While evidence suggests there is some level of immunity for those who previously had COVID, it is not known how long you are protected from getting COVID-19 again.
1/1	While i am thrilled to have received my first dose and have a firm appt for my second dose. My hubby is not so luckly. He received his first dose March 12 and has not received a call for his second dose. Seems you have a better shot with a state dose vs a federal dose. So sad
1/-1	While in philippines 2 shot and first dose in different brand ??
0/1	While the vaccine was developed in record time it is important to know that it has passed all the necessary requirements for emergency use authorization than any other medicine or vaccine requires.
1/1	While there are lots of people whose experiences of racism in the medical field bred their anti vax opinions (whose experiences are valid and should be listened to), they're not justified in spreading propaganda or misinformation about vaccines. Also the Covid vaccine is one of the most trustworthy in history due to the affirming background research you already explained halfway through the video.
0/0	While your information wasn't useful at all !.you're upbeat and positive personalities make me more scared than ever before !. It comes off very stepford wivesy !. And the fact that you're expected to take this for lack of better words experimental vaccine.and no one knows what the side effects are going to be I mean no one knows what the side effects are going to be. And the government makes it where you cannot hold them liable for damages !. No I don't buy a car without a warranty !you're not going to put a experimental vaccine inside of my body and tell me well it may work it may not work and who knows what it's going to do !. When your kidneys are shut down, your heart is firmly damaged, and your kidney cease to function because of this experimental vaccine. And you and your family have no recourse financially.Because the government decided that there will be no liability to this vaccine yeah I don't think that's fair !. I'm not going to be pfizers guinea pig !.stay safe people and take the vaccine I think all of you should take the vaccine !.
1/-1	Whilst I agree that it is much better to have the vaccine than risk Covid, the statistics James uses are not correct though. He says that one in every thousand people that get the virus in the U.K. die of it. If that were true and given that yesterday we heard that there were 70k deaths it would mean 70m people have already had the virus in the U.K.. if that was true we would not need a vaccine?
1/1	Whilst I agree that there needs to be more transparency between the government and the public to curtail scepticism in its many forms, I think that if people believe the vaccine is harmful and don‚Äôt want it, leave them be. Have them sign an agreement that they refused the vaccine and if they contract Covid, they have to cover their own treatment.
0/-1	Whilst we are grateful that the pharmaceutical's made the vaccines, the government funded and rolled it out, we're at the end of the line now. The public should get the choice to get boosters or not, without them being isolated from society

People have died of the flu over the past year and a half because there's been no mention of a flu strain, therefore they kept their mouth shut about it so as to let people catch it, die, and blame it on a disease that doesn't even exist!!!!!!!!! I'm living proof! I've done everything normal, been everywhere i wanted to go, including packed bars, have never worn a mask, and I haven't even had a cold in well over a year!!!! Am I lucky, F no!

I wonder if they are trying to save us or justify their decision. If enough anti vaxxers influence enough people not to be vaccinated does that force the government to make vaccines mandatory for certain activities like travel because we wouldn‚Äôt achieve herd immunity? Thus causing the thing they are fighting against
0/0	Why are the 300,000 that die from a single Covid outbreak in the US more important than the 100,000 that die every bad flu season? Or the 50,000 that die during even a moderate flu season?

0/-1	Why are there no traditional Covid-19 vaccines? I admit I've been hesitant about the mRNA vaccines, but at the same time I really don't want to keep playing with fire. I think myself and a multitude of others would feel more comfortable taking a more "traditional" vaccine like the NovaVax or CoronaVac. It would for sure boost vaccination rates. The question is why are none being approved for use, but they are approved everywhere else in the world....

Why do the pharma companies have full indemnity against being sued. Why are their so many people who have already suffered from these vaccines, seizures that can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be stopped or death. Why is there no investigation into the people in a nursing home who having survived the peak of corona now 24 of them died within days of receiving vaccine. Why the censorship of thousands of doctors professors and scientists who have facts that media will not allow us to hear. Why

0/0	Why do people want a vaccine? The Australian vaccine has been halted, as those vaccinated were testing positive for HIV antibodies.

That doesn't seem too wild a theory now, does it?

Wake up and stop listening to DR Fraudci now. This was a #plandemic. It was a test of our freedoms and you all failed miserably. Watch what happens when they make it mandatory to get the vaccine.

Why doesn't he worry about vaccinating "EVERYBODY" also apply to the flu, pneumonia, etc.?? And why does he say that the vaccines PREVENT infection when that isn't true? The effects of the lockdowns have been far worse than the effects of the virus for a disease with a 99.5% recovery rate.

0/0	Why would the vaccine protect against different strains and not natural immunity? Come on dude. Don't just eat up everything the government says, ask some basic common sense questions.
1/1	Why would they even need to kill people with vaccines like that when there are nukes? It'd be a lot quicker.
0/0	Why would this be longer lasting than the immunity acquired by people who have already recovered from Covid-19
0/0	Why would we debate vaccines? Remember, the science is settled. We don‚Äôt need to question lord pfauci and his holy juice. Safe and effective! Safe and effective! You can‚Äôt catch covid if you get these vaccines! All you people sounds like anti vaxx plague rat scum. Stop killing gramdmas!
0/0	Why would we listen to anything WHO has to say. They have compromised themselves when they hid the truth of this pandemic from us.
0/0	Why would we need a vaccine when there are medications that work?!
1/1	Why would you listen to a nutcase on the internet instead of proffesional doctors?
0/0	Why would you need the mRNA vaccine to help your immune system when all you have to do is take your vitamins and eat a good Balance diet
0/0	Why would you put an untested and unproven substance into your baby and risk not only your own health but that of your unborn child
1/1	Why would you rather listen to some random person on YouTube, than doctors and scientists? The millions who've already died from Covid would envy your chance of getting protected by a vaccine.
0/0	Why would you take a medicine (vaccine) not YET approved by the FDA?
0/0	Why would you take a untested vaccine for a virus that's 99.9% survivable and only inflicts the elderly with pre-existing health issues?
0/0	Why would you take a vaccine that hasnt been tested and proven over years
0/0	Why would you think its reasonable to get vaxxed after 2 years of Lies, Propaganda, lockdowns? I find it quite unreasonable to even entertain the thought of ever trusting those vile creatures in government again. They can write anything they want in this report, even If they release it. It might be some Kind of damage control report.
0/0	Why would you trust the government? Big Pharma has ZERO liability if the vaxx/booster injures or kills you!!! #bloodclots #VaccineSideEffects
0/0	Why would you want a vaccine for a virus that‚Äôs never been isolated? A virus so deadly it‚Äôs cured the flu
0/0	Why would you want to give essential workers an experimental "vaccine"? It hasn't even been shown to prevent contagion.
0/0	Why would young healthy people need a vaccine
1/1	Why wouldn t you get the vaccine? Even if your not at risk wouldn t you get it in case of coming into contact with at risk people and the vaccine could help them?
0/0	Why you are giving this microchip for people....You are shameless
1/1	Why? Is it bcs of blood clots? It's a very rare thing. 4.6 cases out of 1 million shots.
1/1	Widespread vaccination for COVID-19 is a critical tool to best protect everyone from COVID-19 and COVID-19 related complications.
1/1	Widespread vaccination for the coronavirus means that the virus will not infect as many people. This will limit spread through communities.
1	Widespread vaccination for the coronavirus means that the virus will not infect as many people. This will limit spread through communities. Both Pfizer and Moderna report that their vaccines show approximately 95% efficacy at preventing both mild and severe symptoms of COVID-19
1/1	Wife getting the Covid vaccine. A huge relief. Phew.
0/0	Wife vaccinated and boosted, still got Covid, twice. I‚Äôm only vaccinated and didn‚Äôt get it. The vaccine doesn‚Äôt do what it is suppose to do.
1/1	Will I do it? Probably yes, although I'll definitely leave the first batches for those who actually need it.
1/1	Will I do the vaccination? Probably yes
1/1	Will I get another dose if approved for the general public? Of course. Will I get a yearly dose if it comes to that point? Yes. We all have a social responsibility for own health as well as the health of others to make a society like ours function.
1/1	Will I take the COVID Vaccine? Yes. Do I trust it will work? Yes. Do I think that once I have the vaccine, I am immune to COVID-19? No. I would still take reasonable precautions till this whole thing blows over, but I will feel a lot better about things. Vaccines do not create immunity‚Ä¶they enhance your resistance to the disease

0/0/0	Will NEVER get the vaccine
0/0	Will continue to wear a mask and do social distancing but I will not take vaccine.
1/1	Will definitely do when available to me but health care workers and others need it way more than us right now
1/1	Will follow the science like we have always done. I have 3 and if requires 4,5 or 6 or if it is an annual vaccine, I will get it so I can live life again and not burden the hospitals should I get sick.
1/1	Will get a vaccine because getting a case of COVID-19 would require hospitalization.
1/1	Will get the coronavirus vaccine as soon as an FDA-approved option becomes available.
1/1	Will get the vaccine immediately.
1/1	Will get the vaccine within one month.

0/0	Will happily go to the wire on this one...if you intent to try and force this on me expect force in return..
0/-1	Will happily go to the wire on this one...if you intent to try and force this on me expect force in return...
0/0	Will it actually provide a high level of immunity though?
0/0	Will not be taking a vacation for the Chinese virus
0/0	Will not be taking this jab, people need to realise it‚Äôs gonna be booster after booster it was never gonna stop at two jabs
0/0	Will not comply! Informed Consent would involve both long-term data on the experimental technology and no duress what so ever to make health care choices for myself including taking a "vaccine" ie: Untested mRNA genetic modification technology. Any attempt to prevent people from traveling is patently repulsive to all free people.
0/0	Will not get the vaccine
0/0	Will not take due to the vaccine distribution.
0/0	Will not take it. Absolutely not
1/1	Will probably give the vaccine to my kids
1/1	Will recommend it to family and friends.
0/0	Will the mainstream media be giving as much airtime and an updated tally for everyone who has been harmed, disabled or died by having the vaccine, in the exact way that they have reported on the daily amount of people testing positive or dying with the virus?
0/0	Will this vaccine give me immunity? Doctor: ‚ÄúIt gives Pfizer immunity.‚Äù
0/0	Will this vaccine program really make any difference when a estimated 40% say they will not taking it?And now reports of suspension of injection's for any one with a allergic reaction response history.Obviously drug company protecting it back from litigation if adverse effects become a issue?
0/-1	Will u take responsibility of the side effects caused to others?
0/-1	Will we have to carry a vaccination certificate for when the Gestapo ask to see our papers?
0/0	Will we young people bear children in future? We will have to wait and see
1/0	Will you have to have booster shots ? , course you bloody will. Lots of money in vaccines .
0/0	Will your job keep you on if you become disabled due to vaccine? My aunt now has heart complications after vaccine. Now she fears becoming laid off due to those complications. A few days after 2nd dose, she went into her first only seizure and mini coma, with doctors unable to explain it. Now she has needs to constantly monitor her heart pressure.
1/1	Willing to completely trust modern medicine and doctors and nurses to receive an organ transplant-one of the most invasive procedures ever-but unwilling to trust that same modern medicine and those same doctors & nurses who are requiring a vaccine?
0/0	Wish I could convince my Grandmother to not get the second shot. I'm terrified for her, she doesn't understand that shes risking her life more by getting the shit.. I mean shot.. than she was by NOT getting it. At 83, and healthier than most people I know that are half her age, she just wont listen to the bad reports from the damn vaccine!
1/1	Wish I could get a vaccine!
1/1	Wish I could get it here in Mexico.
1	Wish I could show this to my dad so he‚Äôll let me get vaccinated (I‚Äôm an essential worker) but it would only lead to an argument or me getting kicked out
1/1	Wish mRNA vaccines were available in my country.
1/1	Wish they would hurry up in the Netherlands. So far only ~2/18 million have been vaccinated.
1/1	Wishful thinking, but I‚Äôm going to choose to trust if Biden and Fauci said it‚Äôs happening, it‚Äôs happening. That being said, I‚Äôm fully prepared to be disappointed.
0/0	Wishing I never got Moderna. Hands have hurt every since.
0	With 0 long term studies... what could go wrong.
1/-1	With 26,000 city workers still unvaccinated Saturday, those who haven‚Äôt complied with NYC's COVID-19 vaccine mandate will be put on unpaid leave starting Monday. https://t.co/vKbI26aJf9
1/1	With COVID cases surging worse than ever, getting vaccinated is one of the most important things we can do. But until the vaccine is widely available, socially distancing and wearing masks will actually save even more lives, and alleviate the pressure on healthcare workers.
1/1	With Delta the hospitals are full of young people who thought they didn't need the vaccine because they are young and healthy. Getting vaccinated is also doing ones part to reduce spread to those who are at higher risk of dying.
1/1	With Moderna switching to more doses in a vial, I presume they can increase shipments also? Or has that already been implemented?
1/1	With Yellow Stain gone and a vaccine in the pipeline ... 2021 is looking better already
1/1/1	With a mask, and a vaccine. Yup, those are great for you!
0/0	With all due respect no one knows the long term effects of the vaccine. Not hating or anything.
1/-1	With all due respect, what about the older people in nursing homes and first responders?
0/0	With all this covid19 vaccines going around the world do you believe they will tell us when they've found the cure√¢‚Ç¨
1/1	With all those people against vaccines, science and doctors I really wonder how humanity managed to progress so far this much!
1/1	With anti-vaxxers there is no hope for the human race
0/0	With any unknown, parents are very frightened of doing something to their child that might have long-term ramifications
0/0	With current recovery rates and Ivermectin available. why bother ?Just looking at the various stats makes it clear we do not need to immunize the entire population. Save the money to improve and build our medical facilities.
1/1	With each shot that goes into someone's arm, we get closer to the end of this pandemic.
1/1	With most of the country vaccinated that should cause Covid to die out in this country.
1/1	With my job description I wouldn't have a choice. Either way I would absolutely get vaccinated.
0	With respect to unvaccinated deaths, a large contribution of death comes in 2-7 weeks post vaccination. The problem is that first 2 weeks are counted as unvaxxed. But there is a strong co-relation to duration from vaxx.
1/1	With so many not vaccinating and spreading eradicated viruses, I want more vaccines as fast as possible, especially mmr.
1/0	With stuff like this im okay with them saying, tough your getting it.
1/-1	With the Corona vaccines, we even have the advantage that they have already been vaccinated millions of times worldwide. So that even the detection of very rare side effects has been simplified.
1/1	With the invention of various vaccines, antibiotics, and other therapeutic agents, the average life expectancy has increased dramatically in recent years.
0/0	With the restrictions and vaccines we do our best to generate a stronger virus. The weak virus froms will disappear from the restrictions and vaccines, so the strong mutants can get ground.
1/1	With the super spreading variants here, it seems to me it's pretty simple - get the vaccine or get covid.
1/0	With the vaccine only reducing your risk of serious symptoms but not actually stopping you getting or spreading the virus nullifies the actual reason for a passport. If the vaccine actually stops you from getting the virus it would be a no brainer. I‚Äôm not against the vaccine at all. But i am against anything that‚Äôs completely inutile!!!!
1/1	With the vaccines, the cases of COVID-19 are going down. Thank You for the warp speed of the vaccines being available and a big Thank You to the Nurses, National Guard, and Volunteers for their service of saving lives.
0/0	With them Omicron spreading like a wildfire, we can see how ineffective vaccines are with the prevention of the spread. Luckily, this variant is mild.
0/0	With this amount of people, that potential for unknown side-effects could be magnified with a larger sample size (with obviously a larger range of health states), and become noticeable.
1/1	With vaccine passports we can have the best of both worlds!
1/1	Within 9 months we have five vaccines with excellent trial evidence & others to come
1/1	Within a couple of weeks my whole family should be vaccinated (other than me, I‚Äôll be at the end). It‚Äôs a really good feeling.
1/1	Without Astrazeneca, Britain wouldn't be in the happy place it is today, with cases falling and deaths falling too (there were only 23 deaths yesterday, out of a UK population of 67 million).
0/0	Without Vaccination i survived, got covid-19 i give credit to my immune system and not the vaccine, not only that i seen people who are fully vaccinated and still died.
0/0	Without having studies to prove this is effective, it is reckless to do this.
1/1	Without strict measures and mandatory vaccination we will never get rid of the pandemic.
1/1	Without the vaccine, we can't go and watch the sports event live!
1/1	Without vaccination verification it's extremely unlikely that any International travel will be permitted in future It's doubtful this will impact heavily on many of the anti-vax people...because they know the earth is flat
1/1	Without vaccines we would still have polio, smallpox etc. I will have the jab as soon as it is offered.
1/1	Without vaccines you don't have immunity to fight the virus.
1/1	Without vaccines, schools will not be able to fully re-open.
1/1	Without widespread vaccination, we will not be able to end this pandemic
1/1	Without widespread vaccination, we will not be able to end this pandemic #vaccine

1/-1	Woho finally!
1/1	Wolverine‚Äôs healing ability can‚Äôt save me from COVID. But the vaccine can. Get it!
1/-1	Women on BC are at a much higher rate to get blood clots than either the AZ or J&J vaccines are causing, and nobody is doing anything about it. What is this bullshit?
0/0/0/0/0	Won't be getting that vaccine for sure. Until years after where its guaranteed safe and has 0 side affects long term.
0	Won't be injecting poison into me.
0/0	Won't be taking any vaccine poison that messes with your DNA.
0/0	Won't have any side effects for me because I will never take it. My body my choice. If it's ok to say that to kill an unborn human being them what could be the problem.
0/0	Won't take it unless it's forced on me.
0/0	Won't touch this unless I 100% couldn't get over it.. they are acting like the side affects are nothing lol
0/0/-1	Wonder how much Pfizer payed that ginger lad to hype it up
1/0	Wonder if the full dose caused an immune response against the viral vector
1/1	Wonder why people don't catch smallpox and polio nowadays. Oh, they have been vaccinated, including the anti-vaxxers!
1/-1	Wonderful
1/1	Wonderful news! Let us crank this vaccine out to the maximum and get everyone protected. Then we can do the right thing and help out those less fortunate than ourselves around the world. Spread the love, not the virus!
0/1/-1	Wonderful news!!! Britons that are thinking and questioning everything.
0/-1	Wonderful news, but I wonder what's with this site stating that the vaccine failed? Is it credible in any way? Or what do they mean?
1/-1	Wonderful news, incredible earrings!
1/1	Wonderful news. Now if only the children in this country have parents who are intelligent enough to get them vaccinated.
1/1	Wonderful!!!! Thank you science for being a light of hope!!!!
1/1	Wonderful. There should be so much hope in this vaccine from the Oxford University team. Thank you so much, Oxford U.!!
0/-1	Wondering which country the zombies begin

0/0	Won‚Äôt happen here. You all enjoy your dna altering
1/1	Woo hoo! One down, one to go!
1/1	Woohoo first vaccine Syringe done with Astra Zeneca. If I do get any side effects I shall just have to relax and read @MichaelRosenYes new book, started last night - it‚Äôs a wonderful and emotional read. An ode to the NHS and to his lovely-sounding family.
1/1	Woohoo! Covid Vaccine booked for Wednesday!! Wasn‚Äôt sure if I‚Äôd still be classed as vulnerable after being discharged but very happy to be invited
1/1	Woohoo! I got my first Covid vaccine today! (We had to double mask while there.)
1/1	Woohoo! They're following the science. A 0.0006% chance of a clot *from* the jab is a MUCH smaller risk of a blood clot from catching covid, using birth control, or several other commonly prescribed substances.
0/0	Woooow...Disasters...Panics, fears...Compulsory....Mandatory...What about the quality of medical treatment? We see that in some countries, like the Netherlands, with 88%, did not bring any result.. We have a new lockdowns, new measures, full hospitals....So the solution? When the first two did not work, let's continue with the third one....Let's make it mandatory...Logic? The governments are loosing any logic in this crisis management.
0/-1	Woops, they died. ‚ÄúThis is how science works.‚Äù
1/1	Woot! Getting my first shot tomorrow! So excited to be apart of the stats.
1/1	Words cannot explain how joyous I am to know that my grandparents will get their first dosis of the #COVID19 vaccine this week!
0/-1	Words don't do justice to how grateful I am to have come across you, you're genuine and humble and you help to translate scientific jargon into simple and easy to understand language. I hope you see this and can possibly help me, I'm at a fork in the road of what to do, either get the vaccine or go with natural immunity. A brief overview about myself, I'm 34 years old, 5 ft 10 inches tall, and 85 kg. Australian aboriginal, eat vegan, go gym, and am in overall great health, no serious health issues, just very basic health issues that we can get throughout our lives, and easily eventually get over. Once again, thank you ! You've earned a subscriber. Finally, I'm surprised in a good way, the civil discourse in this comment section, I feel comfortable in this community, thanks !
0/0	Work on Saturday was voluntary; however, those who refused would have their rations reduced by half (Animal Farm).
0/0	World is suffering from the politicians more than covid-19. Vaccine is created to make companies and politicians reach.
0/0	World is thankfully WAKING UP to your outright lies and emotional manipulation. Say no to vaccine.
0/0	World should protest against vaccine

1/1	Worst case scenario of the vaccine is still better than getting the virus.
0/1	Worst effects.... Does That include Death??
0/-1	Worst one out there, don't trust Russia.
1/0	Worth mentioning--the pope has told Catholics that it's a moral imperative to get the vaccine.
1/1	Would DEF get the vaccine - husband and I are both anesthesiologists and in patients airways all day everyday and we have an 8 month old at home. Would do anything to keep him from getting sick.
0/1	Would I call pro vaxxers paranoid ? Most definitely that ls a title that could fit many of them. They get so paranoid with any desease lol.
1/1	Would I love to have seen a 10 year study on the vaccine? Sure. That's not a thing we have the luxury of right now. First dose down
0/0/0	Would a person with more than 2 brain cells to rub together get this vaccine?
1/0	Would another way of looking at these deaths be this: the same people who are fatally vulnerable to Covid-19 are also fatally vulnerable to the vaccine for the same reasons? If this is a correct statement, then doesn‚Äôt this cast doubt on the benefit of this vaccine?
0/1	Would be great but there is very little evidence they work.
1/0	Would be terrible to think that these "tribes" of anti vaxxers are having their beliefs reinforced by people employed to create anti vaccination posts and memes etc.

0/0	Would rather have the virus then go anywhere near the vaccine
0/0/0	Would rather have the virus then go anywhere near the vaccine, never trust a jobsworth
0/0	Would someone please explain why Trump is spending OUR MONEY on a poison vaccine, when there is already a cheap, plentiful, and tested treatment/cure for Covid?
1/1	Would think that everyone would want to take a vaccine that decreased the chances of dying by 99%
1/1	Would you either take a perfectly safe vaccination to own the sheeple or possibly spread disease what a brave stance from this lil freedom fighter bravo.
0/0	Would you fly in an untested experimental aeroplane, If the answers no then ask yourself why would you allow an experimental untested biological pathogen that for the first time in human history that actually goes in to your DNA and alters it . How much do you trust the government's and multi trillion pound corporation's that in the past gave us: Thalidomide, Asbestos in baby powder, HIV contaminated bloods to haemophilic children, None of these assaults on humanity saw and prison sentences, they are about to do it again as the world's governments have cancelled legal recourse and public prosecutions resulting from adverse reactions. Keep your holiday, Keep your fancy restaurants, Keep your needs and follys, Keep your Autoimmune diseases, Keep your horrors of science, I'll keep my DNA and know that fear did not drive me to give up that which is truly MINE.
1/-1	Would you rahter to scientists that studied for several years or some tin-foil hatted fool?

0/0/0	Wow no thanks! I'll be at the end of the line. There was not enough proper testing for a vaccine of this type.

1/0	Wow remember when we thought the Oxford vaccine would be ready in the fall? Now they are in line to be the fourth OR POSSIBLY FIFTH! What a damn shame. Stoked to know when the J&J is coming though!

0/-1	Wow! The experts finally making sense! It only took two years for them to pull their heads put of the sand!
0/0	Wow, I'm impressed about his confidence regarding the medium/long-term efficacy of the vaccine. Can you tell me how many doses are needed to maintain medium/long-term protection? 1 dose? 2 doses? 3 doses? 4 doses? 5 doses?...
0/-1	Wow, I‚Äôm sure everyone was hoping you‚Äôd slow down production...

1/1/1/1	Wow, this is amazing. I'm looking forward to getting the mRNA vaccine!

0/0	Wow. Finally, answers! Don't take that vaccine!
0/0	Wow. I feel the same way!!! All of these vaccinated people getting sick and having issues and I'm like what's the downside of not being vaccinated? The only one I can think of is.... I'm never sick. I don't understand how people don't see that the vaccine compromises their natural immunity.
1/1	Wow. Just wow. A few months ago it seemed like this will drag on for a very long time. Now look at this. Awesome. Science does wonders.
0/0/0	Wow. Pfisor makes their own study.. aren't responsible for harm...and the ones making money on it. How dumb do people have to be to believe these Demon's.
0/0	Wow. The side effects is a whole other pandemic... Smh
1/1	Wow. Very impactful! Please get vaccinated!!
0/0	Wrong! Herd immunity is more successful by getting the actual virus. We do NOT need a shot for a virus with a 99.9% recovery.
1/1	Wrong, it‚Äôs 2 1/2 times more likely for someone with natural immunity versus someone that‚Äôs fully vaccinated that have never had covid. Natural immunity isn‚Äôt stronger. My best friend just died 3 weeks ago at age 34 unvaccinated.
0/0	Wrong, vaccines have, not even minimally, been shown to have boosted anyone's immune system, or prevented the spread of any disease. It's back to the drawing for you, doctor.
1/1	Wrong. The vaccines DO lessen transmission. "These people" are selfish and stupid. They aren't making a choice based on facts or science. Their ignorance has caused our hospitals to be strained to the point where surgeries are being rescheduled, and people who need emergency care for other illnesses can't get it. The only diseases that have been eradicated are smallpox and rinderpest. But polio is very close to being eradicated--by vaccines. We rarely see children get measles in this country--because of vaccines. Your "personal freedom" to swing your arms ends at your neighbor's nose. You don't have a right to put others at risk.
0/0	Wt was z sign 4 it ha???? U r z son & doughter of devil n I won't take dis vaccine
1/1	Wtf are these people thinking!! I am vaxed and still think this is way to young!! 99.999 kids are safe
1/1	Wtf is wrong with these people for real? They‚Äôre PROTESTING the vaccine? I mean I think I‚Äôve seen it all now.
0/-1	WwhhaaattT‚ùìdid he just say this is an EXERCISE?
1/1	Y'ALL!!!! I just got a time & date to get my first #COVID19 #vaccine shot!!!
0/0	Y'all can have that vaccine. I ain't taking it at all. Ain't going to happen
1/1	Y'all complain about the side affects from the vaccine. If you were actually impacted by covid you wouldn't hesitate to get it. I'm still recovering 3 months later after being in the hospital w it. I got mine today and I feel kinda sick, but it's nothing compared to covid itself
0/-1	Y'all still doing that, huh? Lol. Bless your hearts.
1/1	Y'all! Get vaccinated, wear a mask, and keep working to keep each other safe. We're not out of COVID19 yet.
1/-1	Y'know, amidst our fantasies of flying cars and rocket powered hoverboards, it's easy to forget that we're already in the frickin future.
1/1/1/-1/1/1	YAYYYY can't wait to get one

1/1/1/1	YES GET THE VACCINE IF YOU DONT GET THE VACCINE YOU SHOULD NOT be allowed to travel international...happy now..
1/1	YES IM VERY SURE UR VACCINE IS GOOD AND THEN IS COMINE SOON THANK U
0/0	YES ITS UNSAFE ... AND NOT TESTED SUFFICIENTLY!
0	YES KEEP FIGHTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Standing with ya'll from Detroit, Michigan!!!
1/1	YES! The "side-effects" are a strong indication that your immune system is responding strongly to the vaccine. THAT is what you want! Your body is reacting to the supposed harmful "bug", the vaccine, and is ramping up the response.
1/1/1/1	YES, of course, I will take the Covid-19 vaccine! With pleasure and no fear!
1/1	YES, of course, I will take the Covid-19 vaccine! With pleasure and no fear! And finally the perspective of being protected against that dreadful virus within a month after‚Ä¶ a dream!
1/1	YES. PLEASE get the vaccine when your age group is eligible. I‚Äôm 17 and my mom doesn‚Äôt want me getting it but I am making it a goal to get vaccinated ASAP. My first flu shot was only a year ago because she was skeptic and I am perfectly healthy right now. Please stay safe everyone!
1/1	YES.a Million times YES. The Pfizer one, which is one of the MRNA ones, and can be ‚Äútuned‚Äù to work for all variants, including the current South-African one (where I live). The anti-vaxers are welcome to get Covid, as we need to breed fools out of society.

0/0	Ya I have immunity. It‚Äôs called an immune system.
0/0	Ya I've just had my first dose and I'm still scared of the exact same thing as you, i mean a vaccine should be tested for at least 5 years, and this came out fast, o well too late now, for me anyway,
0/0	Ya absofuckinglutely not. I can wait a few years.
0/0	Ya didn't even need the FIRST shot but those that took it are wheely uckfed now.
0/0	Ya know anybody who gets this vax is just straight up brainwashed
1/-1	Ya plz missing the move theatres
0/0	Ya right. Remember when doctors recommended tobacco for good health?
0/0	Ya want me to take Johnson vaccine when they can‚Äôt even make cancer free baby powder???
0/0	Ya'll can take those vaccines before i do, thanks Never takes vaccine
1/1	Yall better get the vaccine when it comes out!
0/0	Yall getting injected with something that isn't even preventing the virus
1/1	Yall happy with living in lockdown still?
0/0	Yall still getting the vaccine üòÇ, just don‚Äôt be mad at the ones that don‚Äôt want to take it later on when your love ones or yourself gets sick or something. I hope they don‚Äôt but just at least government don‚Äôt care about us. It‚Äôs 2021, cmon ü§¶‚ôÇÔ∏è lmaooo.
1/1	Yall want this frantic about 3K ppl dying A DAY enough to stay in the house but 6 cases of blood clouts out of 7 million got yall saying "see this is why i didn't get the vaccine". Alrighty
1/1/1	Yay just got my first dose of Moderna yesterday! Arm has a small welt on it and is a little sore but no real problems. Only side effect so far is a massive case of relief.
0/0	Yay to all of you wonderful people against mandates on this thread!!! You make this unvaccinated person feel less alone in this civil war.
1/1	Yay we need that vaccine in Ohio too!
1/1	Yay! I want the Johnson & Johnson one how do I sign up for that one
1/1	Yay! Proud of you! Excited to get my vaccine (although that won‚Äôt be till probably october) and then i can go back to school :)
1/1	Yay!! I can't wait to see my friends and go out drinking and meet weird people again.
1/1	Yay, Mayim - Yes!! I agree with you 100%. Everyone get vaccinated- for Covid19 we‚Äôre all in this together.
1/1	Yay, finally there might be an end to this pandemic!
1/1	Yay, that‚Äôs great news.
1/1/1	Yay, they finally got a vaccine
1/1	Yay... I am up for it!!
0/0	Ye we getting used as guinea pigs no vaccine for me
0/0	Yea I know 3 people who have had both vaccines... And both have caught covid after!
1/1	Yea I'm nervous too, for those exact reasons. But I'm probably going to get it ASAP. I'd rather roll the dice on a vaccine and its side effects instead of Covid and its side effects.
0/0	Yea and that's why the majority of us "the smart people" yall trying to sell this bogus quick profits to ain't buying them ever. I'm gonna take my 98% chances everyday before I take any one of them. I'll get sick 50 times before I consider taking anything you'll are selling. What doesnt kills you, equips you
0/0	Yea and why are they censoring all the doctors on YouTube that have been speaking against taking this vaccine ...if its safe why censor them what are they trying to hide. They must think the ppl are stupid
1/1	Yea dude it‚Äôs so safe !
1/0	Yea how bout dont take the vaccine. Stop letting the media and celebtraties convince you that the vaccine is safe. Many people are reporting horrible side effects like DEATH
0/-1	Yea its rare but I'm thinking twice about the vaccine now. 36 reported cases of thrombocytopenia by early feb21. When and if it occurs to someone it's devastating
0/0	Yea man but 1 death is way too many for medicine designed to cure you. I cant trust it. Too scary to risk
0/0	Yea try forcing into me and you're finna taste this 9
0/0	Yea vaccines that cause deaths
0/0	Yea when the side effects are worse than covid no thanks
1/1	Yea, I mean, who would want to get a vaccine against an infectious virus anyway? Seems silly. I mean, it's not like the current ICU, ventilators and deaths are attributed mostly to the unvaccinated...oh wait...never mind. Let Darwinism work! (the unvaccinated are 23 times higher than the vaccinated to be hospitalized due to COVID)
0/0	Yea, I'll pass on being a guinea pig.
1/1	Yea, I'm glad to see so many people getting vaccinated
0/0	Yea, I‚Äôll never take that vaccine
0/0	Yea, great idea. Just keep shooting yourselves up with something that‚Äôs not approved.
0/0	Yea, lets stop giving it to ppl under 60. The people 60+ need to die anyway so lets force them...
1/1	Yea, people who get the vaccine can still get it. They just become 95% less likely to get it. This is huge, so let‚Äôs not discount it.
1/1	Yeaaaa had my vaccine today, halfway to freedom I hope, side effects with everything, its a chance you take. ü§î
0/0	Yeah Democrats want to force this down our throats. I don‚Äôt consent.
0/1/-1	Yeah I always compare risky activities to the risk of breathing and just say fuck it I breathe so why not try and ride a chainsaw down a ski slope.
1/-1	Yeah I am not sure what they are going to do. I am sure that some people will take it after they see a bunch of other people do it. But some never will.
0/-1	Yeah I feel better. NOT! Its all adding up. I have suffered an anaphalactic reaction. Do not want to have another one
0/0	Yeah I got the original strain, spent every moment of it with my wife and infant child‚Ä¶ they never got sick and I beat it in 48 hours, it‚Äôs all lies
0/1	Yeah I really don't get it. It just feels off how hard they're pushing this vaccine, not to mention that all the "bonuses" come off as patronizing with a $5 gift card or some crappy fast food place. I'm for vaccinations, but not vaccinations that are released this soon with so little testing.
1/1	Yeah I want it. So hurry it up already. Let‚Äôs stop wasting good vaccine on the GOP pandemic deniers and give it to frontline workers/elderly and then me
1/1	Yeah I was so skeptical at first! I am glad I researched more about the vaccines. I'll take the first available! üòÅ
1/1	Yeah I will definitely get the vaccine even though I have a general phobia of needles. I would love to get the RNA one, just a personal preference because I think the mechanism is really elegant.
1/1	Yeah I will definitely get the vaccine even though I have a general phobia of needles. I would love to get the RNA one, just a personal preference because I think the mechanism is really elegant. But given that I'm young and healthy, I will have to wait...
0/0	Yeah I'd rather not become a guinea pig, but thanks anyway.
0/-1	Yeah I'll be rushing right down to Hannaford's to get a vaccine developed in less than a year with unknown long term effects to protect myself from a disease with a higher survivability rate than the flu.
0	Yeah I'll get the vaccine in the next life R IP
0/0	Yeah I'm not getting this vaccine I don't know wtf is in it .
0/0	Yeah I'm not taking that garbage I'll take my 99.997% survival rate
1/1	Yeah I‚Äôm good getting vaccinated and not being dead
1	Yeah and don‚Äôt worry about anything. It‚Äôs completely safe. Research has been solid and proven safe Take their word for it.
0/0/0/0	Yeah because everyone is so excited for vaccines. It wasn't good enough that we drink and eat posion now they want us to inject it in to us
1/-1	Yeah because people listen. My moms anti vax but I got all my vaccines because my doctor said ‚Äúit‚Äôs time to get some vaccines you should her XYZ‚Äù and she just said ‚Äúyes ok‚Äù.
0/0	Yeah completely safe after two failed shots with promises and mandates... It doesn't work.
0/1	Yeah coz no jab no work,kids gotta go to school and eat.i personally think she didn't have a choice.i can see deep inside her eyes she not happy
0/0	Yeah fuck that. Not shooting up some mystery vaccine
0/0	Yeah give it to old people first, in a few years time they‚Äôll be dead which they‚Äôll simply put down to old age not this over exaggerated virus
0/0	Yeah good luck making me take it
0/0	Yeah honestly I cannot even date someone who can be this easily brainwashed ... lord knows I also would not want to be pressured into getting an experimental vaccine everyday.
0/0	Yeah im 32 and in great health, no vaccine for me, i simply dont need it. If i were forced to tho, based on my research id take the jandj one
0/0	Yeah it is poison, and it takes along time for side effects to go away, along time stay safe.
1/1	Yeah it will help vaccine hesitant people while they watch the vaccinated wear masks ‚Ä¶. Awesome , I‚Äôm so glad I got vaccinated so I can be forced to act like it didn‚Äôt matter , while everyone says it was a good idea
0/1	Yeah it works preety well In truthful Europeans countries...not in nigeria where the scammers in government are in charge of funds and pallative. Shame.
1/-1	Yeah its been very disappointing on several fronts:
0/-1	Yeah it‚Äôs dangerous for us to think outside public opinion... that means we‚Äôre probably doing something right üëçüëçüëç
0/0	Yeah it‚Äôs no longer a conspiracy when it‚Äôs actually happening.
0/0	Yeah let's talk about the shortening of the protein multiplication process and not go too deep on how the trial phase was rushed.
0/0	Yeah my grandma 64 died 3 weeks after getting the vaccine
0/0/0/0	Yeah no thanks. I'll take my chances with the virus.
0/0	Yeah nope. Not shooting up some mystery vaccine
0/0	Yeah right Good luck with pushing that Johnson and Johnson Vaccine
0/0	Yeah right!! 143 deaths in UK shortly after vaccinating and government brush it under carpet as irrelevant due to underlying health issues. They‚Äôre the people we‚Äôre supposed to inoculating...how many deaths from these vaccines are acceptable??
0	Yeah that makes sense. You're taking a shot to keep you from dying but you have a chance of dying anyway. You have to cross your fingers and hope you aren't one of the unlucky few
0/0	Yeah they kill people don‚Äôt act like no one is dying from taking the vaccine B.G. The man who says we need to depopulate now all of the sudden wants to save the world with the vaccine, let that sink in
1/0/1/1/1/1	Yeah we are living in times that for the first time people are more afraid of a vaccine than the actual virus
0/0	Yeah we should definitely decimate our military over a shot that doesn't actually work all that great, especially when Russia and China are inching really close to starting a 2 front war that the US will be dragged into. This is a great idea.
0/0	Yeah when people start developing strange cancer in 10 years from the vaccine, don't say I didn't tell you all so
1/0	Yeah yeah I know, low risk, take it anyway. We need kill shots in arms and sheep herd immunity.
0/0	Yeah you guys are gonna have to chase me down with a tranquilizer to get that shit injected in me. I'm straight on have fetal cells injected in my body.
0/-1	Yeah! right! I don‚Äôt believe a word of it and will never have it. The reason for my decision are to long to go into to here
0/0	Yeah, I am not taking that vaccine.
1/1	Yeah, I got covid a week after the second shot and thank God that I did. I am 55 and overweight and I didn't fall super ill, it was weird and I could feel how the vaccine was helping me not to get sicker. I am convinced that if I hadn't been vaccinated that I would have ended up in the ER or worse. People GET VACCINATED!!!!!
1/1	Yeah, I recon we‚Äôve got about 35-40% that are going to idiotically decline the jab...because ‚ÄúmUh FrEeDoMs!!1‚Äù
1/0	Yeah, I will take the shot too when im almost 80
1/1	Yeah, I'm drinking copious amounts of tea this morning too. Hey ho. We'll get through this sure enough. And spring has nearly sprung, then summer and by then we should all have had our vaccines.....
0/0	Yeah, I'm still not getting it.
1/-1	Yeah, I'm wondering why there are so few doses available already. Wasn't "Warp Speed" supposed to be about manufacturing doses prior to approval? It seems like they should have been able to produce much more than what they have so far.
0/0	Yeah, I‚Äôll avoid that poison...
0/0	Yeah, I‚Äôm going to inject genetic material into my body because these two guys said it was OK
0/0	Yeah, I‚Äôm not sure about the vaccine. I‚Äòm immunocompromised, a former cancer survivor since 20 with many years of chemo throughout my twenties and thirties. I also suffered a stroke this past January from (told anyway) damage inflicted on an artery from radiation done in my mid twenties. Anyways, point is, I‚Äôm not in the best of health. I got vaccinated (Pfizer) back in April, second shot in May. Soon after my first shot, I began to develop a dry, unproductive hacking cough and strange feeling in lungs, as if I had pneumonia. This was a nuisance, but I didn‚Äôt pay it much mind. After my second shot, I began to develop sickly spells in my entire body, waves of sickness that are akin to sea sickness or food poisoning in their manifestations. A burning, infectious feeling through my body that is always present, but can worsen to hellish degrees, leaving me in misery. Crying over the toilet, vomiting and diarrhea, then going away over a period of minutes. It can be absolute misery, yet is unlike any illness I‚Äôve ever had. Since May, I have been in the ER three times, seven primary, three walk in visits, two specialists, and a week in a mental hospital from suicidal ideation from being so miserable. Yet all doctors have no clue what is going on. All my bloodwork is fine, lung scans are clear. Only thing that has shown up in my labs is an elevated sedimentation rate and positive rheumatoid factor, non-specific indicators of inflammation. Yet whatever this is, it often leaves me bedridden and has been a marked decrease in my QoL. I‚Äòm not an anti-vaxxer. I believe in the science, I trust the medical community. But, I cannot shake the coincidence of timing of when this obscure illness began to when I got my first shot, and how it became significantly worse after my second. This is purely conjecture on my part, but I suspect I‚Äôve had some exceptionally rare adverse reaction to the vaccine. Maybe it‚Äôs triggered something, like Lupus? I can think of no other cause. Don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm posting this, maybe in the hope someone knows something. I‚Äôm planning on a last resort to Mayo but am not optimistic they will find anything. This is flying under all screening, yet leaving me in misery. I wish I hadn‚Äôt gotten the shot.
0	Yeah, I‚Äôm not taking a vaccine for this either.
1/1	Yeah, anti-vaxers. I say let Darwinism sort them out
1/1	Yeah, it‚Äôs funny how numb I am to people dying of Covid now. At this point, people get what they deserve. Don‚Äôt vax? Fine, no one outside of your family will feel bad when you get Covid and die.
1/-1	Yeah, my husband was just a little tired after his, so there's really no telling, I guess? But it seems almost over now, so yay!
0/0	Yeah, no I'm not sticking a rushed vaccine in me when masks can do most of the work (at least if the people I've read that from are true lol).
0/0	Yeah, no one is allergic to poison, its poison.
0/1	Yeah, no one wants a fake vaccine for a fake pandemic. Who could have imagined that?
0/0	Yeah, sure. We all really need to go through all this for a virus that only kills 0.3% of us anyway. Get lost.
0/0/-1	Yeah, that "rare immune reaction" is getting to be pretty common
1/1	Yeah, the "my body, my choice" argument doesn't apply to public health crises.
0/0	Yeah, they sure aren't miracles, lol. As a survivor of two adverse events, I sure won't be taking this one.
0/0	Yeah, you can skip me in line
0/0	Yeah,id rather be in a gunfight than take a vaccination
1/1	Yeah. Everybody should take vaccine
1/0	Yeah. I'll wait until it's reasonably available and hopefully any side effects that may have been missed during the rushed approval have been found out.
0/0	Yeah. I‚Äôm at the point of not trusting any thing and any body ‚Äî‚Äî here in 2021.
0/-1	Yeah. Sell some vaccines. Apply psychological blackmail and stories about people that have accepted your false narrative. Sell sell sell. Pretend to fix a health crisis. While helping to create a health crisis.
0/0	Yeah. Sell some vaccines. Apply psychological blackmail and stories about people that have accepted your false narrative. Sell sell sell.Pretend to fix a health crisis. While helping to create a health crisis.
0/-1	Yeah. The sheeple have lined up to receive the injection and now the consequences and repercussions are discovered...... SMH
1	Yeah.. Vaccines are safe. It's called a side effect, you get side effecs on any medications. Hell, even panadol gives you side effects. The vaccine is safe, it will not cause you any danger.
0/0	Yeah... I think I will wait at least until there are a few more guinea pigs vaccinated first..
0/0	Yeah.... Like I've always said.... What vaccine???? I'm not unvaccinated.... Just unstupid...
1/1	Yeah? My friend just lost her 40 year old bodybuilder cousin, previously in excellent health. Not old, not unhealthy and not vaxed. Ya know, vitamins aren't FDA approved either, IJS. I don't want forced vaxing, but if you're not gonna vax, MASK UP OR STAY HOME. You have a right to make decisions about your health but not everyone else's.
1/1	Yeahhh vaccination should be provided cuz this is only solution to control this pandemic
1/1	Yeahhh vaccination should be provided cuz this is only solution to control this pandemic.Healthcare should be vaccinated too
1/-1	Yeeeeeesssssssss
1/-1	Yeees!!
1/-1	Yeees, soon I can see ice hockey agian
0/0	Yep for a virus that is 99.9% curable. SMH at how much stupidity is out there! Vaccine is more dangerous than the virus! My body my choice! I choose not!
1/1	Yep had my astra yesterday feeling good today
0/0	Yep of course you don't need the oldies you want to eliminate them as they are no longer productive!!! Murderers!!!!
0/1	Yep! Like I said my sons all up to date on his vaccinations I‚Äôm definitely a ‚Äúprovaxx‚Äù parent and don‚Äôt agree with the antivaxx movement. But it‚Äôs just not possible for a vaccine that has had less than a year of trials to be able to identify any long term side effects.
1/1	Yep, I'm probably not in the risk group (hashimoto's) but I will get it as soon as it's made available to me.
0/-1	Yep, I‚Äôm fully vaccinated (Pfizer) and boosted a month ago, tested positive 4 days ago.
1	Yep, medical and vulnerable groups first, but after that, I'd be happy to be next.
0/0	Yep, that's 8-10 doses they want to inject you with. When you see the damage at 3-4 doses. At the 8th, it's genocide guaranteed.
1/0	Yep, took it for 12 years, back to back, side effects left-right and centre. Men are very lucky...not compulsory ok , but let‚Äôs be honest we have all felt pressured to take it from partners and society at some point. It does however have therapeutic properties for certain conditions and also lowers the risk of a certain type of cancer (whilst it increases the risk of a different one). It‚Äôs deemed safe , it‚Äôs broadly prescribed to women as young as 13. And this vaccine is even safer in that respect. Open your pill‚Äôs side effects leaflet- yeah, ‚Äúsudden death‚Äù is listed.
0/0	Yep. Get a jab, with no long-term data, against something most healthy people have a 99 percent chance of fighting anyway. Snake oil.
0	Yep. I am unvaccinated as are my children. No one in my house has had Covid before. We are all very healthy. My wife is fully vaccinated (her choice even though I asked her not to do it). Guess who got Covid first and spread it to the whole family?
0/0	Yep. I'm not activated, I'm anti covid vax.
1/1	Yep. Lost my grandfather a few days ago to covid. I hope people can get this vaccine soon so no one has to deal with this any longer.
0/0	Yeppers..that's why I'm waiting. Never been positive for Covid.
1/1	Yes . Take the shots because the government says it good for you. Take the shots. The government knows exactly what you want and need. Do what they say and get used to to government control.
0/0	Yes ... We know how it will work ... Vaccines at least annually ... Different strains ... New vaccines! ... The pharmaceutical companies must keep making billions ... The media and governments pushing these "miracles" ... While the stories of those injured get covered up
1/1	Yes I am convinced that the vaccine is safe. We're talking about 95% efficacy or 90% efficacy way more than the typical 30 or 50 you get from the typical flu vaccination.
1/1	Yes I am proud to have taken 3 shots‚Ä¶.I did it as it was the right thing to do in order to assist in protecting my family and our healthcare system.
1/1	Yes I got my vaccine so did my husband and soon our 18 year old daughter so we can see and hug our grandchildren again soon
1/1	Yes I plan to. Covid is dangerous and if everyone would get the vaccine we would have far less problems.
1/1	Yes I was skeptical at first but because i have a comorbidity I got it rather than get covid and have 10x worse
1/1	Yes I will have the vaccine when it is offered to me and I am well aware there is a risk. My sister-in-law, a healthcare professional had the vaccine 10 days ago and had a slight anaphylactic episode immediately after. She was OK after about half an hour.
1/1	Yes I will take it because I care about other people than just myself
1/1	Yes I will take the vaccine because I'm a teacher and I want to get back in my classroom with my students asap.
1/1	Yes I'm absolutely 100% sure that both vaccines that have been discovered are safe. And I am absolutely 100% sure that Donald Trump is not safe and that if his lips are moving he is most likely lying. 100%.
1/1	Yes I'm taking the vaccine. I'm tired of masks.
1/1/1/1	Yes Moderna or RNA is very effective, I am done with 2 shots already, No side effect whatsoever.
0/0	Yes and I eat pink pancakes. No vaccine is safe. A vaccine in under a year is a joke. You can do little research to find out how useless flu vaccines are. For all of you getting the vax.. to a man made virus with a 99.8% survival rate ask your doctor about the vaccines ingredients, if you want fetus cells, Mercury and lead in your body then you deserve to have the vaccine.
0/0	Yes and we are expected to allow our children to get these vaccines??? People protect your child
1/1	Yes autism cases are rising, and we do not know yet what actually causes autism, but to say its vaccines is crazy. Studies have been done looking at millions of children and no correlation between vaccines and autism can be made. One possible cause for the increase of autism cases is our better understanding of the illness and we recently changed many of the global questionnaires for autism diagnosis around the time of the increase as well. I don't think anyone should force things to people, but for those who cannot get vaccinated, the vaccinated population is their only defence. I've had all my vaccines and I get a yearly flu vaccine.
1/1	Yes because I have put way worse things in my body! Lol. Bring on the vaccinations!
1/1	Yes because I'm not selfish. Just because it might not kill me doesn't mean I won't get someone sick and have it kill them.
1/1	Yes because experts believe that getting a COVID-19 vaccine may help you keep from getting seriously ill. It may also protect you and protect people around you.
1/1	Yes because getting Covid19 is not option me
1/1	Yes because it's important I do for those who cannot because of their health. I have a responsibility to keep up the heard imunity
1/1	Yes but covishield is effective post second dose. Side effects are common but vaccine should work for long term
0/1	Yes but refusing the vaccine is career limiting, as only NHS staff who have been vaccinated can work in front line, patient facing roles.
1/-1	Yes by taking the vaccine
1/1	Yes dr you are perfectly right all the front line workers should be vaccinated first they have and still are risking own lives to save others
1/1	Yes for vaccination. Getting the vaccine gives us some peace of mind too.
1/1	Yes get the vaccine!
0/0	Yes good idea. Sleepy Joe and his supporters should be jabbed at least once a day until they disappear.
0/-1	Yes half of the uk are smart
1/1	Yes hooray my mom's booster dose is booked finally as well!
1/1	Yes i am, wanna get back outside enjoy nature, without governnentao restructions. Here in europe it causes Young deaths
1/1	Yes it is looking promising. It‚Äôs also technology and the type of vaccine that makes a difference as to why it‚Äôs happening faster.
1/1	Yes it will be fine. These things are not released without proper testing. Anti-vaxxers will disagree of course and you will see lots of silly comments on Facebook etc.. In the end you need make the decision you are comfortable with but for me, I am very happy to be vaccinated as soon as I can and I all those dear to me do too
1/1	Yes it's safe
0/0	Yes let's let big business get even more into our medical history than they already are
1/-1	Yes missed my covid-19 shotüò´.....maybe NEXT weeküëç
0/0	Yes my elderly neighbour on one side of me was rushed to hospital last night with breathing problems 6 hours after receiving the vaccine and my other neighbours hand swelled up huge after he recieved his.
1/1	Yes of course I will, as soon as I can. I do not enjoy worrying constantly about being exposed to a dangerous disease. I want to be able to see my very elderly mother safely, to touch her. I cannot endanger her, so I must keep my distance. The vaccine is safe, a hell of a lot safer than viral infection. There is a new, highly transmissible variant reading rapidly around the world. The faster we can get vaccinated, the fewer of us will die, it is that simple.
1/0	Yes of course we need the booster shot, why you are not reporting the side effects and the deaths from the vaccines for each country you mentioned that they started with the third dose of this elixir ???
0/0	Yes part of my concern is long term effects that are unknown at present. The vaccine hasn‚Äôt been tested for the long term dangers so thats my number one fear. Also have concerns of the Bell‚Äôs palsy and death possibly of being related to vaccine.
0/1	Yes people have had serious side effects from the COVID vaccines and yes people have died from the COVID vaccines. No the COVID vaccines don't stop the Corona virus from happening. There are more negatives than positives with the COVID vaccines.
1/1	Yes please get vaccinated help stop or at least slow it down this virus is not messing around
1/1	Yes please take vaccine
1/1	Yes please vaccinate the stupidest ones firstly.. cheers mate
1/1	Yes please. Apparently there are way too many stupid people in this country that think they're smarter than those that created the vaccine and so insist on refusing it. We save our lives by saving theirs. After this pandemic is over, we'll look them in the eye and say, 'you're welcome'!
1/-1	Yes plss take
0/0	Yes pump that poison in those corrupt puppets
0/0/0/0/0	Yes thank you I'm an antivaxer, I have the right to choose
1/1	Yes thank you for this vaccine, I know it will stop coronavirus indefinitely just like the other ones for sure.
1/1	Yes thank you for this vaccine, I know it will stop coronavirus indefinitely just like the other ones.
0/1/1	Yes the vaccine itself can in some cases cause a similar allergic reaction that the virus can. It‚Äôs extremely rare but obviously a potential side effect. Think of it as the non fatal form of covid - if you got covid, you‚Äôd have this reaction PLUS the other effects.
0/0	Yes those people made a wise choice in getting unprotected exposure to a lab created gain of function genetically enhanced mutated virus known to have killed 5m so far - yes these people are indeed the smarter ones
0/0	Yes vaccination is not safe if we don‚Äôt do anything about it- it will go on and on
1/1	Yes very safe and effective in preventing hospitalization and death. most governments and scientists around the world have worked extensively to develop the vaccines
1/1	Yes we all know that Lisa but it does stop us from getting seriously ill and needing hospitalised it‚Äôs not going away anytime soon this Covid but through vaccines we can control how sever we take it, it like the annual flu jab you can still catch flu but on a lesser severity, I‚Äôve had my first jab 3 months ago and my 2nd one is on Monday the 3rd of May and I can‚Äôt wait to be fulling vaccinated and get my life back to some sort of normal it‚Äôs the non vaccinated ones that‚Äôs keeping the pandemic going.
1/1	Yes we need to vaccinate our children.
0/0	Yes well I just read a nurse got infected after the 1st dose..so..
1/1	Yes with Vaccines, let's save lives from the chances of disease and dying from Covid-19, in this way let's hope to end the pandemic
1/1	Yes! 90% of the drive thru vaccine stations are well done and efficient. It's incredible to me that we can tackle the biggest public health problem of our generation and the fix is free, fast, and drive thru.
1/0	Yes! Absolutely.There is nothing more dangerous than this vaccine than any others, or else they would not make it available.I thought at first that I would want to wait a while and see before taking it, but at this point, I don‚Äôt have to ‚Äúdecide‚Äù to wait. I‚Äôm 32, I am not an essential worker, and don‚Äôt have any health risks. I have several friends who work in healthcare and have already received the vaccine, and they are all happy and healthy. Soon everyone I know who is a teacher or social worker will get it too. It will be months before I am eligible to get one.
1/1	Yes! Everyone should get the vaccine so they can't spread the virus or contract it themselves!
0/-1	Yes! I am more concerned about My child more than I am concerned with the population! Damn right!!!
1/1	Yes! I have taken the vaccine finally!!!
1/1	Yes! I want to protect myself.
1/1	Yes! I will get a vaccine as soon as I am allowed to
1/0	Yes! Lets not give any vaccine to China
0/0	Yes! this will protect my families Gene's for the rest of their lives! (By manipulating and allowing them to be infertile) hooooray for modern RNA manipulation with technology
0/0	Yes! this will protect my families Gene's for the rest of their lives! (By manipulating and allowing them to be infertile) hooooray for modern RNA manipulation with technology.
1/1	Yes!!!!!
1/1	Yes, I agree everyone should take the vaccine.
1/0/1	Yes, I am getting vaccinated now, but only because the self-tests are no longer accepted or can no longer be carried out at all, which really annoys me.
1/1	Yes, I believe that vaccines work
1/1	Yes, I finally received my first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech‚Äôs vaccine 2 weeks ago and I am hoping there will be enough supply to give me the second shot.
1/1	Yes, I had a combination of shoulder soreness, headache, fatigue, and malaise (i.e. general body achiness) that lasted ~48 hrs with the first dose, and ~60 hrs with the second one. I got both doses on Fridays, and luckily I had already had both following weekends scheduled to be off. I felt ready for work again the next Monday both times. I think my experience is typical, but some people get no reaction, while others get a low-grade fever or take an extra day to feel better. Overall, it was so totally worth it to be significantly protected against infection!
0/0	Yes, I have done extensive research, and I will NOT risk my life on getting this vaccine.
1/1	Yes, I plan to get the vaccine. People who are more at-risk should be able to get it before me, but getting vaccinated is something that will help stop the spread of the disease, and I'll be able to go see my little nephew
1/1	Yes, I probably would. I'd like to do some more traveling in the future.
1/1	Yes, I will get the vaccine once it is developed.
1/1	Yes, I will get the vaccine once it is developed. I will go one step further. I will get the vaccine even in the experimental stages.
1/1	Yes, I will surely take the Covid 19 vaccine. This will help me in getting protection against the dreaded virus.
1/1	Yes, I will surely take the Covid 19 vaccine. This will help me in getting protection against the dreaded virus. The present vaccine developed by Covid 19 has undergone a three level clinical trial and has been certified by both the international as well as Indian health agencies. There has not been any life threatening situations reported so far by the candidates who have taken the vaccine. So in my opinion it is safe to take the vaccine and we should surely take both doses of the vaccine, as the first dose will produce
1/1	Yes, I will take the vaccine. I thought I would try to slip past in some queue if possible. So that I can take my second dose soon.
1/1	Yes, I will. I'd rather be a guinea pig for any possible long-term effects for the vaccine than for long-term effects of Covid. That said, it'll be a while before I am eligible (30s, no co-morbidities).
1/1	Yes, I would accept the vaccination invitation. Advice is not to have any other vaccine.
1/1	Yes, I would get a COVID vaccine.
1/1	Yes, I would like to take vaccination
1/1/1/1	Yes, absolutely. I will get it when it is available to me given my spot on the priority list.
1/1	Yes, absolutely. If people don't get it this virus won't go away. If I don't get it I'm no better than the people I consider the problem
1/1	Yes, absolutely. That's the only way we'll stop the pandemic.
1/1	Yes, and I regard anti-vaxxers as criminals who should lose custody of their children.
1/1/1	Yes, as long as it's Pfizer or Moderna.
1/1	Yes, as many people invent crazy stories about the Bill Gates and all that stuff, the companies wouldn't risk their own names making an unsafe vaccine. Also over physical health, I'm talking about mental health, I'd rather to have headache and fever for a couple of days and go to the cinema than not getting vaccinated and therefore not being able to go to school
1/1	Yes, because I am an at-risk person and working in a high-risk job.
1/1	Yes, because the anti-vaxxer rhetoric is ridiculous and fucking retarded.
1/1	Yes, because the risks of a vaccination complication are small.
1/1	Yes, because the risks of a vaccination complication are small. Typically, the problem is an allergic reaction - anaphylaxis. The rate of anaphylaxis for these vaccines are 11.1 in a million. [1] In most cases of anaphylaxis, no treatment was required, just careful watching.
1/1	Yes, but as a healthy young person I'll probably be the last of the line.
1/1	Yes, but immunity through vaccination is more long-lasting than immunity through infection.
1/1	Yes, cancer patients can receive one of the mRNA covid vaccines( i.e. moderna , pfizer).
1/-1	Yes, chicken pox is very bad if you get it as an adult, which is why before there was a vaccine people would intentionally have their kids get it. There's a small risk to kids too, but that's much better than getting in as an adult, so you would roll the dice!
1/1/1/1	Yes, definitely if a vaccine for Covid-19 comes out I'll get it, because we all know, we can't live our whole lives locked down
1/1	Yes, especially since I haven‚Äôt been in the UK since January and would like to visit my parents in 2021. But like some others said: I live alone, am a healthy amateur athlete in my 20s, do home office and don‚Äôt eat out at all, so I am really in no rush. Seeing my family a month or two later after a year without contact won‚Äôt be the end of the world.
1/1	Yes, everyone should be free to make their own choices. But when it comes with risk to others, we have to draw a line. Every COVID Patient in the ICU or the hospital in general means one less bed for someone else. Meaning, because you made a choice to not get vaccinated, someone else with a condition out of their control potentially doesn‚Äôt get that bed and the care they need. Cancer patients who were meant to have their operations next week have to wait another couple of months. It‚Äôs not just about your health, it‚Äôs about everyone else‚Äôs health too. I don‚Äôt like being told what to do either, I don‚Äôt think anybody does. That doesn‚Äôt give me the right to endanger others.
1/1	Yes, for God's sake. Please get vaccinated, keep your loved ones safe.
1/1	Yes, i wanna protect those around me.
1/1	Yes, if not enough people get it then we will not have herd immunity, which is a negative outcome. It then becomes the responsibility of the governing body to put in place restrictions, like we‚Äôve seen over the last year, to entice people to comply.
1/1	Yes, it is amazing that we have a vaccine and we can thank President Trump for Operation Warp Speed
0/0	Yes, it is causing blood clots and strokes, etc... in many people of all ages...üòßüòßüòß
1/1	Yes, it would be nice if we could get vaccinated. We are in category 1b, why are other groups being taken ahead of us? These vaccines and appointments are impossible to get.
1/1	Yes, it's definitely safe!
1/1	Yes, it's working. The vaccines reduce contraction, transmission, hospitalization, and death.
1/1	Yes, it‚Äôs Satan and Milo who brought COVID to unvaccinated devout christians who rely on god for protection. You cannot make this stuff up
1/1	Yes, of course I trust the COVID vaccine.
1/1	Yes, of course you have already had the virus, I believe you despite the thousands of times people lie on here to try and prove their point. Of course, the USA is the root of 99% of all conspiracy theories so maybe you should be thinking of whether to believe the yank idiots who come up with these conspiracies or believe educated scientists?
1/1	Yes, parents should most definitely have their children vaccinated. Frankly there is a lot of complete bollocks out there about the alleged risks of vaccines - in reality vaccination is extremely safe, and much much much safer than running the risk of the infection the vaccine is intended to prevent.
1/1	Yes, please get vaccinated. There is no evidence of any kind of long-term side effects, and while this particular vaccine is new, this type of vaccine is well-researched. Note that a lot of people do have some immediate effects, like a sore arm for a day or two, or even flu-like symptoms for a day, so plan for that.
1/1	Yes, polio was wiped out. Congratulations on bringing another idiot into the world.
1/1	Yes, research to date indicates the vaccines for COVID-19 have a very good safety profile.
1/1	Yes, tf COVID ain‚Äôt no regular flu. I have forgotten about the influenza vaccine for awhile. But the COVID vaccine is essential, idk how I would be affected by that virus without it.
0/-1	Yes, the WHO needs to stop spreading all its 'alternative facts'.
1/0	Yes, the anarchist pro-vax argument is that vaccines are good. They prevent an extraordinary amount of suffering and death with negligible downsides. Countless medical treatments that are correctly considered to be uncontroversial and good are still nowhere near as useful and safe as vaccines.
1/0/1	Yes, the key is getting mass-vaccination done in the developing countries. This isn't happening and its galling to see European (and other) politicians knocking and stockpiling AZ, when they could so easily be sent to those who really need them.
0/0	Yes, the truth is vaccines = bad. Although it's good to make lots of money by lies.
1/1	Yes, the vaccine hurts my arm. But it is worth it!
0/0	Yes, there is little demand. Even ~30% of nurses say they are hesitant to get the vaccine disregarding any limited supply.
1/1	Yes, there's around 1% breakthrough infections of vaccinated people. However, because they're vaccinated, they don't usually end up dead.
1/1	Yes, this is truly a matter of life and death.
0/1	Yes, those "vaccine's" affects can come years later as the Neurosurgeon said.
1/-1	Yes, until you‚Äôre struggling for oxygen in the local hospitals ICU and expect everyone else to pay for it.
1/1	Yes, vaccines are important & life saving.
1	Yes, vaccines are not 100% foolproof. Neither are antibiotics. Most medicines do not give you an entire guarantee that they will not prevent weakness under all circumstances. The point is that they help you.
1/1	Yes, very much yes. there is the issue that if I do not take the vaccine, I can never visit my mother again, ever, since she has all the risk factors for COVID.
1/1	Yes, we are going back to normal, let the vaccine come in!
1/1	Yes, we are just one serious outbreak from disaster. The government should be getting as many vaccine variants in to this country so we can have the chance to at least pick and choose the vaccine we are prepared to risk having.
0/0	Yes, when you invest billions of dollars into vaccine development it becomes extremely difficult to allow a potentially better cheaper already existing option like Ivermectin on to the playing field.
1/-1	Yes, where we go
1/-1	Yes, yes we do. Just take a look at Israel.
1/1	Yes, you can still get Covid but people who have been vaccinated have a much lower incidence for death and hospitalization.
1/1	Yes, you have. Vaccines don't stop you from getting the disease, or spreading it. The vaccine helps 'your' body protect 'you' from the disease when you get it. And for most people, hopefully you too, they won't get sick enough to go to hospital (and overload that hospital).
1/1	Yes. Absolutely. My parents are high risk and elderly...I‚Äôd really hate to inadvertently kill them
1/1	Yes. Because I don't want to die of Covid19, or have my lungs or other organs damaged by it.My risk of death if I enter hospital because of Covid19 is around 1 in 60.
0/0/0	Yes. Brilliant. So glad to see so many people are standing up for themselves. You are not selfish for refusing a medical procedure which has zero benefit to you and may even have irreversible harmful effects.
1/-1	Yes. But I won‚Äôt be first in line. I want front line workers and high risk people to get it first. This also lets me see if there are any major initial side effects.
0/0	Yes. Children are dying and suffering serious debilitating injuries POST VACCINATION. The RISKS seriously outweigh the benefits.
1	Yes. Definitely. The trials of the big ones look solid. I'm keen.
1/1	Yes. For the safety of those around me. I believe in science and the scientific community.
1/1	Yes. Get your vaccine. The quicker yall wake up and get it then the quicker this pandemic will be over.
1/1	Yes. I want to be able to offer safety to those who cant get it, and not be a risk to them.
1/1	Yes. I will get the vaccine the second it‚Äôs available to me.
1/1	Yes. I will get the vaccine the second it‚Äôs available to me. I keep hearing everyone to tell me to ‚Äúdo my research‚Äù and I have a bit but I‚Äôm not arrogant enough to think that I can do research better then those who have dedicated their entire lives to it.
1/1	Yes. If you care about the people around you you‚Äôll get the vaccine. The developers have all guaranteed all safety measures will be followed and none will be avoided just to get it out quickly.
1/1	Yes. In fact it has been 48 hours since I received my first injection of the Pfizer vaccine.I have parents, and friends who are at risk. I may be able to brush COVID-19 off, but they can‚Äôt. >80% vaccination is required for herd immunity, and I want to protect them because I care for them.
1/1	Yes. It‚Äôs not a joke. Without vaccines getting Covid is much more severe. Why do you think vaccines of past work. We‚Äôve all had them. Shingle shot. MMR. you take your babies to pediatrician and they administer vaccines. It‚Äôs not a new concept just a new virus
1/1	Yes. More vaccine equity. What a HUGE task WHO. You have my support and prayers.
1/1	Yes. My experience getting vaccinated was unreal. The efficiency was impressive.
1/1	Yes. My mother is being vaccinated tomorrow. I and ecstatic about it.
0/0	Yes. One side forcing the other side to do something against their will. That's what the Left does‚Ä¶
1	Yes. Properly tested on those valiant volunteers, and 95% effective, I‚Äôll get the vaccine as soon as it‚Äôs available. I certainly can‚Äôt depend on a huge portion of Americans to wear masks and socially distance; so a safe, viable vaccine is my only hope of getting back to a normal society. It worked for polio and small pox, and we had no reservations taking those vaccines‚Äîand wiping out those diseases. Of course, the loud anti-vaxers will come up with all kinds of b.s. concerning this new vaccine, and they can elect not to take advantage of it. But that Neanderthalish attitude will move me up in line. So, I‚Äôm good!
1/1	Yes. The COVID vaccine protects me against the severity of COVID 19 disease, helps me to fight the disease better if I contract the disease, less likely to get hospitalised. I trust my overall health helped me to tolerate the vaccine without any side-effects. I keep myself updated about COVID vaccine, as well as the disease with evidence based health information.
1/1	Yes. The miniscule possible dangers from vaccination are far outweighed by the dangers of contagious diseases.
1/1	Yes. The vaccine is proven safe and effective. I even had COVID and still got the vaccine because I don‚Äôt want to spread it or get again
1/1	Yes. Though I want to make sure people who aren't able to stay at home get it first which I believe is the plan in my state
1/-1	Yes. Type I diabetic.
1/1	Yes. Vaccines should be mandatory
1/-1	Yes. Why? Because I'd rather do something to protect my health and the health of others than bitch about conspiracies or "mah RIGHTS." Yes there's risks. Yes it's new. Yes the rollout has been a cluster fuck. But doing nothing won't improve anything for any of us. Fight me, I don't care.
1/1/1/1	Yes. Will take. It is the right thing to do. Same as with every other vaccine.
1/1	Yes... first day I can. Want life to get back to normal and feel it my duty to help protect the vulnerable
0/0	Yes... protect the vaccinated from the unvaccinated by taking the vaccine that did not protect the vaccinated in the first place. Then enjoy your heart inflammation, blood clot or Guillian Barre autoimmune syndrome.
1/1	Yes.My parents and my extended family will be vaccinated before I am as they all work as nurses at the biggest hospitals in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. Once my entire family is vaccinated, I‚Äôll finally be able to sleep better at night.
1/1	Yesss congrats, man! I get Pfizer 2 next week and can‚Äôt wait!
0/-1	Yesss, well done to these brave people, standing up for their rights. What has science ever done for us anyway?! I'll continue to take my advice from Facebook and YouTube like these people. Vaccines...pah!!! I can't wait for smallpox, polio, Diphtheria and rubella to make a comeback. Keep on keeping on, you brave souls
1/-1	Yessssssss cant wait!
1/1	Yesterday I buried my father. Today I go home a different woman than the one whose father got a positive covid test in January 2nd. Thanks again to everyone who wears their masks, who has gotten or plans to get the vaccine, and who are keeping each other safe.
1/1	Yesterday I got a second dose of Sputnik, side effects are the same as the effects explained in the video.
1/1	Yesterday I got to hug someone in my family after more than a year. We both sobbed for a moment. Vaccines are awesome.
1/1	Yesterday I had my second Pfizer vaccine.
1/1	Yesterday United States vaccinated 2million in a single day. We are in a good position let‚Äôs increase the speed of vaccination drive
1/-1	Yesterday a guy in my neighborhood said I was pretty brave for getting my vaccine. He also says that covid is so weak people don't even know they have it so why get vaccinated?
1/1	Yesterday all my family were tested for covid, and were positive. No symptoms, no fever. Everyone in my family got vaccinated.
0/0	Yet Im unvaccinated work in the nhs and not had a day off sick for the past 4 years but get sacked on 31st March thanks then
0/0	Yet another political decision putting the people's best interests in jeopardy.
0/0	Yet many got sick and recovered without a vaccine. NATURAL anti bodies already protecting their system and you want to weaken their immunity again ?
0/0	Yet more dodgy experiments, Act of desperation
0/0	Yet no one is talking about what‚Äôs inside the vaccination itself. If big pharma are so confident, why hide behind legal immunity under emergency use?!
0/0	Yet somehow the deaths have gotten worse this month
1/-1	Yet the anti-vaxxers won‚Äôt be able to let this sink in but would happily believe the fake news off dodgy conspiracy theory pages
1/1	Yet these people who don't want to be told what to do never complain about the millions of other laws telling them what they can't do - speed limits, other mandated vaccines, excess noise levels, letting your dogs run at large, etc etc etc etc
0	Yet they continue to mandate this vaccine. I don't don't get it. I pray for those that got the vaccine and those that are about to, due to mandates .
0/0	Yet they forget to add it's still in trial till 2023 and they don't know the long term side effects. Also if it protected others and yourself then why still the need for masks and distance etc.
0/0	Yet they still want you to take that poison. These people are truly evil and have no soul.
0/0	Yet we should believe the BBC and there reports. Like when they interview 100 people but only show the 4 people that stand there and say how they carnt wait to have the vaccine.
0/0	Yet, nobody knows of anybody that knows anyone that has outright died of covid that wasn't already dying with multiple comorbidities! The same people bringing us these "miracle vaccines" have also long been advocating for a drastic reduction of the human population.
0/0	Yet, nobody knows of anybody that knows anyone that has outright died of covid that wasn't already dying with multiple comorbidities! The same people bringing us these "miracle vaccines" have also long been advocating for a drastic reduction of the human population. 2+2= ?
0/0	Yhea she looks healthy, really, John Hopkins. Aka Bill Gates cash, need I say more, wake up America
1/1	Yo I was on birth control pills for 20 years which came with a higher risk of blood clots than the J&J vaccine does. Why are y'all scaring everybody?
0/0	You ALL Will Be Brought Before the Most Holy Throne of GOD.......PUSHING this LIE!! \n NOT A VACCINE...VAXSCHEME!!\nGENE MANIPULATIONS/THERAPY!!,
1/1	You ARE less likely to get sick if vaccinated, you immune system is quicker at getting control over it before symptoms appear. But if you do feel symptoms, far less likely to be a severe illness. The unvaccinated are at risk anywhere. Though I do believe that natural infection provided some protection, it‚Äôs been debated. You can absolutely still pass the infection even if asymptomatic, however coughing sneezing, etc will expel a higher amount of viral organisms than just speaking.
1/1	You CANNOT GET CORONAVIRUS FROM THIS VACCINE. IT IS NOT A LIVE VACCINE. most likely they had covid already without knowing it when they got vaccinated. Please do some medical research.
1/1	You DON‚ÄôT get as SICK !!! That‚Äôs why you should be vaccinated !!! It‚Äôs YOU PEOPLE THAT ARE KEEPING THE VIRUS GOING !!! Life will NOT RETURN TO NORMAL UNTIL EVERYONE IS VACCINATED , so hope you like this type of LIFE !!! It will NEVER END !!!
0/0	You Forgot to mention that this mRNA uses human cells to reproduce itself, that could lead to DNA mutation and you have no study to proove otherwise
0/0	You actually believe those numbers??? Isnt it interesting that there was NO flu this year?! Because they counted the flu cases as the Wu flu! Take the blinders off people! And masks do absolutely nothing!
1	You actually don‚Äôt get the dead form of the virus. Your body receives something that tells it to learn what to do when/if you get the virus. It‚Äôs a whole new way of vaccines! It‚Äôs going to pave the way for cancer treatments in the future. It‚Äôs cool, scary, but super cool üòé
1/1	You all have had around 28 vaccines. If you are military you have had around 87 vaccines. Stop being delusional and get the vaccine. Actually don‚Äôt, we need less people consuming our limited resources.
1/1	You all realize that if 75% of ppl take the vaccine we can go back to normal‚Ä¶ half of you all don't wanna take it because it takes you all don't wanna go to school
1/1	You allow unvaccinated people at school? Then why can't my kid bring peanut butter?
0/0	You almost had me until you started emotionally blackmailing the woman. In my experience, going outside and seeing new shanti towns of homeless people made me realise that the government was lying to us. I can't unsee it. For all the ro-vaccine people there, you need to clean up the lies being told before we can trust you. The biggest lie is "we're all in this together."
0/0	You always have a chance NOT to take the Covid-19 vaccine. 2. Why? Because I‚Äôm not a rat to be used for the medication testing.
1/1	You answered the most important of my outstanding questions and I feel even more comfortable going to get the vaccine now. I'm so grateful to have come across this video today üôèüèΩ Useful. Concise. Educational. Yes, this video was all that!
1/1	You anti vaxxers are crazy! Take the vaccine!
0/0	You are 100% correct we do not have a vaccine for covid. We have an effective therapeutic that's it
0	You are 100% correct. All this for a virus with a greater than 95% recovery rate. What on earth had happened to common sense and perspective?
0/0	You are NOT talking about the so called covid vaccine right? Because it is not a vaccine
1/1	You are SAF....... IF YOU TAKE THIS!
1	You are a bad person if you do not take it
0/0	You are a good brainless slave. The system loves people like you who are compliant, easy to control and don't think too much. Good luck with that vaccine that supposedly protects against a flu virus with over 99.5% survival rate.
1/1	You are all quite ignorant aren't you? Please watch vaccination videos to understand why it will not harm you
1/1	You are correct, COVID #Vaccine is much better than the Symptoms of COVID infection, additionally it helps your body to build the natural #active immunity (#memory cells) that help your body from any upcoming #COVID19 infection
0/0	You are crazy and a fool. I care not if the creator of the vaccine is Muslim or Jewish or Christian. It is against all these 3 religions according to their Holy books. Just because a Muslim created the vaccine means not it is allowed for muslims to take it. Please seek help.
0/0	You are dead !! World horror organization kills people !! its a depopulation agenda of Bill gates, WHO , USA and UN !!
0/0	You are definitely not counting me in.
1/1	You are going to be okay. Get vaccinated and save lives.
0/0/0	You are in the human trial right now you dunce cap. The australian health minister blurted this out on LIVE TV. An experiment in other words. No one knows what this will do in 6 months, 2 years, or when they next catch the common cold. I am so disgusted at the people who got this shot I feel no sympathy. I just hope they do not spread the poison to others somehow.
0/0	You are injecting coronavirus into my body
0/0	You are killing people, and we will not forget this.
0/0	You are mafia. They poisoning people and than asking them to take a vaccine which is even worst how time pass by
1/1	You are making a great job! We believe in you! Coronavirus gives an opportunity for development - that's one strong positive aspect of this pandemic. I'm watching all of those scientists in awe, keeping my fingers crossed. That's why I believe in science
1/1	You are making the right decision. I‚Äôve had both of mine and despite the concerns it does give you comfort knowing that you should never need hospitalisation even if you catch covid. 43 million had vaccine 327 bad reaction, I‚Äôd say odds very much in your favour
1/1	You are much more likely to face myocarditis from COVID than you are from the vaccine. At this rate, the virus is coming for all of us. Protect yourself, while there's still time. Even if COVID were only as bad as the flu, the flu is capable of killing you too
0/-1	You are not allowed to hold the drug companies accountable. Nuff said
0/0	You are not forced to take it. Stay strong
1/1	You are not forced to, but you are greatly encouraged to because your not only harming yourself but others.
0/0	You are not immune after the vax! THERE IS NO CURE FOR THE COVID!
1/1	You are playing a very dangerous game if you think you're better off not getting vaccinated. Are people dying in their millions not incentive enough for any sane being to see reason?
0/0	You are right vaxy, the vaccines are killing thousands.
1/1	You are right, it happened with the original sars vaccine. Scientists are now very aware of how and why this happens and are able to avoid it.
1/1	You are rioting against the vaccines because of conspiracy theories while every data proves vaccine works safely
0/0	You are safer not taking their experimental poison.
0/0	You are soo intelligent, don't go for any vaccine.
0/0	You are submitting to be a lab rat
1/1	You are the troll, not Tony. Not vaccinating your children is the choice that kills. Raising your child in an environment with other unvaccinated children also kills. The amount of vaccinations we get could be a debate worth having, but nobody ever raises that point unless they attempt to use it to undermine vaccination entirely, effectively forcing sane people to dismiss them as lunatics, that prefer dead children over live ones. And please do remember that pulling numbers out of your arse serves the same purpose: telling people to dismiss your claims. Today we get vaccinated for 10 diseases in Denmark. We can go through the list if you want to. I definitely want to see your list! Until I see it I will assume that you are a deceitful person, perhaps a fraud and a liar - something 99% of people believe you are, and this is their reason for not contending with your arguments as they don't enjoy debating enough to debate people with such characteristics.
0/0	You are vaccinated and got the booster shot and you still got covid? Then what does getting vaccinated actually do for someone?
1/1	You are welcome to say you don't trust anything about covid numbers. But you have no actual position on how effective vaccines are, whereas all the numbers show that it greatly reduces mortality rates
0/0	You aren't even allowed to question the process . Posts gets pulled off YouTube and you get suspended on Twitter. For just questioning. This should not be political in nature. People have reservations and are genuinely concerned. Those making it political are in the wrong, this is a health issue and we must all be safe whilst having our questions answered.
0	You aren't what you eat. Don‚Äôt be sheep.
0/0	You arent considered fully vaccinated until 2 WEEKS AFTER THE 2ND DOSE meaning if you die from the vaccine, your death will go down as unvaccinated and from Covid. Just another way the Jews inflate the numbers and make it seem only unvaccinated people are dying
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	You aren‚Äôt going to vaccinate me thanks
0/0	You aren‚Äôt going to vaccinate me thanks üëçüèª
1/1	You aren‚Äôt granted immunity, you‚Äôre giving your immune system the proper intel for your body to fight it.
1/1	You aren‚Äôt willing to get vaccinated then stay away from those of us who are. ‚ÄúThey‚Äù haven‚Äôt even offered it to the general public but it totally makes sense to kill your doctors and your front line workers üòÇüòÇ y‚Äôall ridiculous. When there are residents and board directors rushing to get vaccinated but we should take advice from YouTube comments and social media while not listening to people who have PhD‚Äôs in genetics & diseases. Don‚Äôt forget that the earth is flat & the moon is made out of cheese üòÇüòÇüòÇ
1/1	You avoided answering my question, why? Are YOU happy putting a vulnerable person's life at risk by not having the vaccination?
0/0	You being vaccinated doesn‚Äôt stop new variants lol u still stuck in early 2020
1/1	You better vaccinate your child, I don't want my child to get sick from yours
1/-1	You both need to listen toDr Simone Gold and Professor Delores Cahill (immune biologist!)
0/0	You can all take it but don‚Äôt make me or my Family that‚Äôs all I ask And good luck with a vaccine I hope it works out the best for you since there‚Äôs not much to know about it but I guess we‚Äôll find out in time more and more people that take it hope nothing bad happens to you all and end up being worse than the virus itself
0/-1	You can always Trust the Drug Company's. and the government.
1/-1	You can be anti-vax. You just can't lie about the medical facts.
0/0	You can be strong against any virus that comes your way, including COVID-19
1/-1	You can be what‚Äôs considered ‚Äúfully‚Äù vaccinated; that doesn‚Äôt mean that a very small percentage won‚Äôt contract Covid and croak. However, 98-99% of unvaccinated are the ones dying of Covid.
0	You can build trust by being trustworthy. But we all that will never happen.
0/1	You can call it whatever you want. I'm done. Life as normal. I don't care anymore. Or trust any of you. 1800+ views and 9 likes. That says something. Bet the dislike counter would be in the hundreds if they didn't remove it. Most people are over it.
1/1	You can choose between decreasing your risk of dying or getting infected and still won't take it? Are you dumb?
0	You can die from it but don‚Äôt be scared to get it ! So reassuring
0/0	You can either trust all the data collected is accurate and safe or you can use your critical thinking skills to wonder why you can't sue the companies for any side effects. If the margin of safety is so high, why negate the risk of lawsuits?
0/0	You can even put a picture of Jesus in it... I‚Äôm still not taking it
0/1	You can even watch these shorter videos that shows ignorance of doctors who push vaccines on people that don't even know why other than they have been taught in medical school vaccines are safe and effective.
0/0/0/0	You can forget about the world I for one won't be taking it.
1/1/1	You can get side effects from all the medicine so I take the vaccine when my turn comes
1/1	You can get the vaccine now (two, actually). I got mine in college when I went into healthcare
1/1	You can get these side effects from any vaccine....
1/0	You can give mine to some stupid Democrat
0/0	You can give your bullshit vaccinations to the people who want to take them
0/0	You can have mine, I‚Äôll pass!
0/0/0/0	You can have mine.
0/0	You can have mine. I don't need any dead baby vaccine to fight off a scary case of the sniffles that has a 99.6% survival rate.
0/0	You can have mine. I'll wait a couple years. Thx
0/0	You can have my vaccine I'm 69 and doing fine 98% survival rate btw
0/0	You can have my vaccine if you want it
0/0/0/0/0	You can have my vaccine you silly goose. Because I don't trust ig Farma or lying big brother
0/0	You can have my vaccine. I have just declined it (and I am still in perfect health!)
0/0	You can have my vaccine. I‚Äôm a nice person
1/-1	You can just let business owners discriminate and only let in who has a vaccine, just like school does. I don't know why all the fuss over that.
0/0	You can keep all of them
0/0	You can keep it, i the VIRUS isn't that serious, u can believe what u want
0/0	You can keep mine
0/0	You can keep that crap away from me!
0/0	You can keep your DNA changing vaccine
0/0	You can keep your vaccine. Not scared.
0/0	You can listen to your media your free apps but they will kill you. their advice for vaccines is lies vaccines are killing all. be a ware,, mask kills like vax they don't work your own gas killing u slowly
1/1	You can literally look up the side effects and the ingredients of thr vaccines online right now lmao. They tell you what's in the vaccines and what to expect before you get the vaccines. I'm not gonna lie, the side effects suck, but I'd really prefer being vaccinated to dying a slow and painful death or disability.
0/0	You can make all the covid vaccines you want but you'll have to kill me to make me take it
0/-1	You can never guarantee Total Protection from covid-19 people that have been vaccinated have tested positive for covid-19 after all vaccines
1/1	You can not travel or do any work or help anyone..without vaccinations
1/1	You can only throw out a life preserver so many times before you stop trying to save the drowning. I am weary of the unvaccinated to the extent that I no longer care about their catching covid.
0/0	You can push it day and night, not taking it. :)
0/0	You can put this vaccine along with all the others - where the monkey puts his nuts - vaccine are all dangerous
0/0	You can put whatever you want inside of me even someone else‚Äôs heart but I draw the line at COVID vaccinations
0/0	You can replace your 2nd astrazeneca by Johnson & Johnson...or maybe the opposite. Don‚Äôt worry it‚Äôs completly safe according to my mouse. She‚Äôs waiting for the end of human test to be vaccinated
0/0	You can shove your experimental "vaccine" where the sun don't shine.
0/0	You can still catch covid with the vaccines. Or without it use common sense for me the vaccine was rushed just for a billion dollar profit. People die every day from other natural causes or other complication with in themselves thats part of live. Go to the dr for a stubded toe and you got covid and get charged 10,000 for a covid test that cost 8.00 to make stay healthy and be safe and this to shall pass.
0/0	You can still contract, carry, and spread coronavirus with the vaccine
1/1	You can still die in a car accident while wearing a seat belt. Therefore I wont wear my seatbelt anymore. Logic
0/0	You can still get COVID! The vaccine is useless
1/1	You can still get Covid after vaccination, but it would very possibly not be as severe, which could mean life saving. I am fully vaccinated, feeling ok with the vaccines.
0/0	You can still get covid if you get the vaccine and the boosters, dude. Plus, if you're healthy, young and have no comorbidities what's the point in getting the jabs? It's really insane that they approved this experimental jab for kids now. But I'm sure you think it's just fine and dandy.
0/0	You can still get covid, and you can still spred it to others, so why should you take the vaccine?
1/1	You can still have COVID when you are vaccinated, the vaccine just helps your immune system destroy the virus quicker and also makes it less likely that a person will die from COVID
1/1	You can still remind your loved ones to get vaccinated. It's not late
0/0	You can take my vaccine! I'll be treating myself with self isolation, lemsip and bedrest!
0/0	You can take that vaccine and shove it... This is just an advertisement for pharmaceutical companies. Their track record in the past with dangerous drugs hasn't been good at all.
1/1	You can take the vaccines, it will help to prevent death
1/1	You can take the vaccines, there will not be any side effects
1/0	You can talk to me all you want. I am not getting a vaccine that is not approved or even necessary for me.
0/0	You can tell me I am selfish. I am not, it's purely personal medical decision.
0/1	You can trust big pharma. Even though they got immunity from lawsuits and the head of phizer sold off 5 million in stocks. Lmao
0/0	You can't be forced to do anything. You ALWAYS have a choice.
0/0	You can't even trust their powder why would we trust their shots
0/0	You can't force anything into my body!
1/-1	You can't get at people like that with facts.
0/0	You can't make a vaccine for coronavirus because there's multiple coronaviruses there's billions of variants, it's a cold virus
0/0	You can't pay me to take it
0/-1	You can't prove covid is airborne, so I will not wear a mask
0/0	You can't trust a drug dealer
1	You can't use reason to convince anyone out of an argument that they didn't use reason to get into.
1/1	You can't use reason to convince anyone out of an argument that they didn't use reason to get into. guess our education system is failing us -- its shocking how many people dont understand how vaccinations work
1/-1	You cannot choose in the uk. But no worry we have the whole country covered soon. Vaccines r us. It‚Äôs what we do here.
0/0	You cannot create a vaccine for a virus that reinfects. Anyone pushing covid vaccines are just street corner dealers for the world's biggest drug lord Bill Gates.
0/0	You cannot fool the world this days your vaccine is a scam
0/0/-1	You cannot put MRC5 (14 week old aborted fetal tissue dna) into the temple of God, period.
1/1	You cannot reason with Anti-vaxxers.
0/0	You cannot remove experimental synthetic RNA from your genetics
0/0	You cannot trust the Covid19 vaccine as the number of deaths from this vaccine are pretty significant. The number of people having severe symptoms from this vaccine are in quadruple digits. Someone named Muthukaruppan Mani is acting like an expert on vaccines but he is from India. Your opinion has zero value. Please disappear from the Internet as it is not your invention.
0/0	You cannot wear a mask to protect others and you cannot get vaccinated to protect others. Stop with all the crazy talk.
0/0	You cannot. There are no long-term studies and literally hundreds of scientists and doctors that warn for the serious side effects that they expect will occur and that already have occured. There are already so many deaths and hospitalizations in VAERS that there is plenty of reason to worry. VAERS, Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System, is the official US reporting system that according to Harvard Medical School reports only 1% of adverse reactions to vaccines. This means that there could be as many as 1,300,000 deaths from COVID-vaccines already (updated numbers as per Aug. 13th). But they just don‚Äôt admit it and deliberately discourage people to report. But even if reporting is 10% we are talking about at least 130,000 deaths and half a million hospitalizations. In the EU they are currently (sept. 2021) at more than 23,000 COVID vaccine deaths (Source: EudraVigilance). With COVID they called everything COVID to bring the numbers up, now they do the opposite to make it look as if the vaccines are safe
1/0	You cannot. To be honest it has some risks. No more than other vaccines, but they are there. BUT, I know COVID-19 is unsafe, and now with the Delta Varient being more virolent and easier to catch I know I have to decide which will more likely kill me, COVID-19 or the Vaccine? Easy, the vaccine is far safer than the disease.
1/0	You cant get allergies when yur dead and thats a fact
0/0	You can‚Äôt be forced to get this gene therapy. It‚Äôs we‚Äôre in a state of emergency you can‚Äôt be forced to get it
1/1/1	You can‚Äôt fix stupid. Good. The more & quicker for the rest of us. I got my 1st shot today
1/1	You can‚Äôt heal what she had. Hopefully people will see what has happened to her and get the vaccine .
0/1	You can‚Äôt make this shit up‚Ä¶I had Covid a few weeks ago‚Ä¶I would rather go through Covid then have GBS from the vaccine
0/-1	You can‚Äôt say definitely until we see how many of the people that died received the vaccine.
0/0	You can‚Äôt tell me someone isn‚Äôt engineering these variants and spreading them around as they did with the COVID-19 virus originally.
0/0	You can‚Äôt tell me what to put in my CHILDREN!!
0/-1	You can‚Äôt trust anything in the world anymore.
0/0	You can‚Äôt. Remember, normal vaccines take 5 - 10 years to develop. These were fast-tracked, bypassing many safety trials. We are the guinea pigs!
0/1	You could literally read out statements from the vaccination leaflets or the manufacturer's website and people would call you a conspiracy theorist who is spreading misinformation.
1/1	You could look out the window. 100s of millions have been vaccinated. Very few issues.
0/0	You could never convince me to take a vaccine.
0/0/0/-1	You couldn't pay me to inject that crap into my body!
0/0	You couldn‚Äôt pay me to get the vaccine when it‚Äôs first released
0/0	You cried ‚Äú you‚Äôre an anti vaxxer‚Äù at me because I‚Äôm doubtful about this, for good reason. My point is, you‚Äôre free to do as you want, but I‚Äôm not taking it.
1/1	You definitely take a vaccine to protect yourself and others. If someone is vaccinated and they are less likely to become infected or develop symptoms, then they are less likely to spread the disease to others. That‚Äôs why vaccinations work.
0/-1	You didn't mention the bit about the vaccines being given under EUA Emergency Use Authorisation because they have not yet completed regular approval process.
0/0	You do not know what you are injecting
0/0	You don't get immunity after these vaccines, even the manufacturers aren't making that claim
1/1	You don't get to "choose" to drive drunk, and if you do - you'll have to deal with the consequences. You don't get to "choose" not to vaccinate, and put people around you in danger. I find it extremely stupid that spread of disease (by not vaccinating, not wearing a mask, going out when sick, etc') isn't given a punishment, when it equates to, in a way and farther down the line, killing a person, or many. Freedom is relative.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	You don't have to be a conspiracy theorist to sense that there is definitely something fishy about this whole thing.
0/-1	You don't have to be an \"antivaxxer\" to understand the stupidity this year
1/1	You don't have to get the vaccine now, but it would be the smart thing to do.
0/0	You don't hear about the side effects but because anytime it gets posted up, it gets ripped down
1/1	You don't just vaccinate people to stop them from dying, you also vaccinate to stop them getting any other long term conditions that a virus may give.
0/1	You don't know that the vaccine is safe. You're a human petri dish.
0/-1	You don't need immunity from flu
0/0	You don't need jabs. You still get it and pass it
1/1	You don't need to convince me to get the vaccine. You just need to get me the vaccine.
0/-1	You don't rush a vaccine to market.
0/0	You don't wanna take that thing..... they did not take enough time to develop it. your better off risking it with something that's slightly worse then the flu.
1/0	You don't want to cut your chances of ever obtaining the virus at all by about 2/3 while giving you 100% less chance of major symptoms? That seems like a poor choice in logic to me.
0/0	You dont need injections of some magic potion to be healthy.
0/0	You dont need vaccine to survive CoVid...you need it for compliance.
0/0	You don‚Äôt even really know what the long term effects may be! Stop using people as guinea pigs!
0/-1	You don‚Äôt get corona but it could kill some of immune system
0/0	You don‚Äôt have to worry about giving me vaccine keep for you
1/1	You don‚Äôt listen to doctors speaking on Covid prevention, but you listen to the doctors to treat you for Covid ü§î
1/1	You don‚Äôt want the shot don‚Äôt get it, but the people who want it should have the option too. Don‚Äôt stop them it‚Äôs their right.
1/1	You gamble with your life but don‚Äôt spread lies and misinformation about a safe vaccine. Also don‚Äôt infect vulnerable people who could die because of you infecting them. Also if you get severely ill from covid please refuse hospital and ICU admission
0/0	You get a fine if you don't commit suicide. Understand that these politicians need to die unless you want them to come for your kids next.
1/1	You get more mercury eating a pear than are in every vaccine you‚Äôll ever take...
1/1	You get vaccinated early, you get early protection
0	You go take the shot, if your fine in a couple of years I may consider it.
0/0	You go take the vaccine. Enjoy you serious side effects. Hopefully you will still be alive in a few years but I doubt it. Foolish hybrids
0/0	You gon die or turn into a zombie for real
1/1/1	You got the vaccine! That's such great news!
1/1	You got this. Thanks for getting vaccinated!
0/0	You got to love when people who get the vaccine claim that they got sick from someone who hasn't received the vaccine lol
1/1	You gotta be a special kinda stupid to be more afraid of a vaccine than dying.
1/1	You gotta be a special kinda stupid to be more afraid of a vaccine than dying. Every one of us has been getting vaccinated since we were infants and that you are still alive so you can be paranoid is pretty solid proof your fear of this one is as dumb as it gets.
0/1	You gotta be out of your mind to voluntarily inject this genetic product into your body.
0/0	You gotta be the dumbest person to ever accept Dangerous Experimental MRNA gene treatment shots which are still in trails til 2023 against a virus that a 80 year old can survive 99.97%. 2002-2012 All 5 different animals died from MRNA after being subjected to live virus. Have a nice day sheep
1/1	You gotta work on the people that decline the vaccine or are skeptical. Do more commercials, something.
1/1	You guys are doing such a great job informing us about the vaccine! Thank you! <3
1/1	You guys are mad tripping. It‚Äôs literally 1 person on 1 mil ppl this happened with. You guys should read the side effects of ADHD medication or the pill for women. Way more dangerous than the vaccin. Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt seem to care about that???
0/0	You guys do understand that being against the covid vaccine is not the same as being anti vaccines right?
0/0	You guys need to look deeper because these jabs are NOT good!
1/1	You guys pls get the booster!! A 9 person group went ice skating & half got it. The half that didn‚Äôt had the booster. My bf got it & gave it to me
1/1	You guys r all dumb the vaccine has been tested a lot of times and y'all still think it's hazardous and risky lmao and also it's a new technology we aren't in the stone age LMAO
0/0	You guys seem so excited... tell you what, I will sacrifice my shot and give it to one of you
0/0	You guys seem so excited... tell you what, I will sacrifice my shot and give it to one of you :)))). It's ok, you can thank me later
0/0/0/0/0/0	You guys seem so excited... tell you what, I will sacrifice my shot and give it to one of you :)))). It's ok, you can thank me later.
0/0	You guys shouldn‚Äôt take the vaccine. It‚Äôs a hoax right? There‚Äôs no virus right? So yea, ... don‚Äôt take it.
0/0	You guys skipped the step where the consumer researches everything and gains their own knowledge on what they'll be consuming instead of talking to a "medical professional." Look up the ingredients and what they do and consider whether you really need to take unnecessary drugs if you're a healthy individual with a strong immune system and you haven't gotten the virus yet.
1/1	You guys talk like we live in a perfect world governed by angels and all this pandemic is just a mistake caused by nature but now we have the vaccine and the vaccine is so good and just take it so we can all go back to our beautiful lives.
1/0	You had me until you said ‚Äúno risk‚Äù of getting what is being vaccinated against. This is inaccurate and misleading. We need unbiased truth. Thank you.
1/1	You had to show your vaccination record to even get into nursing university. I wouldn‚Äôt want nurses who aren‚Äôt vaccinated working with me. I am a Canadian Nurse and you if you aren‚Äôt willing to protect yourself, you can‚Äôt protect others.
0/0	You hate yourself and freedom of choice.
0/0	You have NO excuse for not researching these vaccines. How can you allow yourselves to put this stuff in people knowing there has been absolutely no time to be sure of what this will do to people? You are making guarantees to a population that is becoming more aware. You will have to answer to GOD.
1/1	You have a better chance of having your Twitter handle stolen than getting a blood clot from the vaccine ;)
1/1	You have a choice: you can save your life and others...or you can take the same life away from yourself and others.
0/0	You have been lied to for two years, purpose, to get that needle into your arm.
0/0	You have covid for the second time and you are fully vaccinated. Then how is getting the vaccine helping? So weird you are telling people to get vaccinated when you are proof it is not working! So strange...
0/0	You have no clue of what the side effects will be until more people are vaccinated. You have a tiny sample to work with right now.
1/1	You have no place in a hospital if you refuse a COVID vaccine . Sorry
1/0	You have survived infectious diseases so far, due to vaccine?
1/1	You have to admit that our doctors are very talented Mash'Allah. Let's trust them and continue to raise awareness. I will try to find the vaccine with my team in shaa Allah.
0/0	You have to be crazy to take a shot for the common cold, what scam
0/0	You have to be one evil parent to have your child stabbed and not consider the horrendous consequences!
0/0	You have to remember that the vaccine is being brought to you by the same people that knew there was asbestos in talcum powder for 60 years and didn't tell you
0/0	You have to remember that the vaccine is being brought to you by the same people that knew there was asbestos in talcum powder for 60 years and didn't tell you.
0/1	You have two choices, one be Zombie ( By taking vaccine) or two be a Survivor ( By not taking vaccine). Your choice, Choose carefully
1/1	You have your ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù to decide what‚Äôs best for you and your family. Your choice comes with consequences. You have placed your family in the no fun zone. See it‚Äôs all about ‚Äúyou‚Äù. Stop complaining and be a good human..get vaccinated
0/0	You imagine putting a seat belt on but it unhooked every time you were hit.That's the "vaccine" as you call it. I wouldnt bother locking it in anymore.
1	You just don't know how vaccines work. That's all. It is not a cure, it is a vaccine.
0/0	You just proved a point: no need for a vaccine when there are plenty of effective alternative therapies that prevent Covid from progressing, prevent hospitalization, & prevent death. The experimental injections do none of that. In fact, quite the opposite.
0/0	You kidding me?! Not enough people are getting the virus so we're purposely injecting, and making super spreaders????
1/1	You know 2 things that never get old? Anti-vaxxers and their children
0/0	You know as well as I do how dangerous the vaccine is!
1/1	You know how not wearing a seatbelt is illegal and gets you a ticket? I don't see why not getting your vaccinations would have a less serious consequence.
0/0	You know how they work? By not taking them
0/0	You know how when we think of the Holocaust, and ask ourselves "how could people let this happen?" Yea, that's going to be our children and grand children asking the same question about us.
0/0	You know how you know the vaccine is bullshit? They have to push propaganda in your face 24/7 to try to get you to take it.
0/0	You know how you're not supposed to buy the first iteration of an iphone or a playstation, or download the 1.0 version of a software and just wait it out till they fix the kinks with the update? Yeah...
1/1	You know it's faster because by now our modern technologies and Experts really help when it comes to this. Back then it was longer because we don't have high tech stuff. But anyways experts will try their best to help others, I believe that
1/0	You know it‚Äôs the end of the world when they force you to take the vaccine
1/1	You know my stances Nick, it's better to get immunity from vaccination. But I won't deny natural immunity exists
0/0	You know our body's can make their own vaccine.
0/1	You know something? If you don't take the 'vaccine', if you maintain a healthy immune system, take responsibility for your health and fitness, and all the rest of it...... One day you're going to wake up dead. Gets us all in the end.
1/1	You know that COVID itself has been linked to some of these issues. It's interesting that you are only focused on the possibility that the vaccine is responsible for any alleged upticks.
1/1	You know that even if this death was related to the vaccine, FAR more people have died from COVID than the vaccine?? Like, its not even comparable. And therefore much better for your health and the health of others to get vaccinated
0/0	You know that it could take years to see if it's safe?
0/0	You know that it could take years to see if the vaccine is safe?
0/0	You know there‚Äôs something wrong when they try to ‚Äúforce‚Äù something on you
0/0	You know they just paused the johnson and johnson vaccine because people were dying of rare blood clots.
0/0/0	You know this is all a joke when South Park makes an episode on it. I hope the (United) States opens their eyes and understand what the real plan is.
0/0	You know vaccinated people are getting and spreading the virus right? lol lol lol wow
1/1	You know what also causes myocarditis? Covid, and it's worse with real covid than the vaccine. Given that Omicron is so incredibly transmissible, everyone is going to get it. Odds are STILL better with the vaccine. Seriously.
1/1	You know what does disrupt a woman‚Äôs menstrual cycle? Stress, anxiety, illness. This pandemic year has really disrupted cycles, not the vaccines
0/-1	You know what else is a very rare event? Dying from covid but we crammed a untested vaccine down the worlds throat.
1/1	You know what is absurd? Not following common sense health measures like getting vaccinated during a global pandemic.
0/-1	You know what is really killing people? Medical malpractice.
0/0	You know what it's not worth the comment. I'm not taking it
1/1	You know what vaccines do give your kids? A future.
1/1	You know what's even more rude? Exposing everyone around you to a disease that can kill them. It's kind of hard to imagine something more rude than killing people.
0/0	You know what's even safer for kids...no shot
1/0	You know what? Screw you guys. I'm a proud anti vax father of 5 and my kids are happy and healthy. Edit: *father of 44. Edit: father of 3. Edit: father of 2. Edit: father of 1.
1/1	You know what‚Äôs amazing? The coronavirus first arrived on our shores about 10 to 11 months ago. And look at how much historic progress we are rapidly making on the COVID vaccines! I am very proud of humanity‚Äôs biomedical science.
0/-1	You know what‚Äôs freaking hilarious? The lady behind the desk is not wearing a mask inside, and the dude outside is wearing one LOL
0/0/0/0	You know where you can stick your vaccine, don't you. It won't be in MY arm!
1/1	You know who really should be protesting right now? Healthcare workers, who have had to endure an extended pandemic of the selfish and unvaccinated. But they won't, because they have too much integrity and too many unvaccinated patients on ventilators waiting for them.
0/-1	You know, people don't always not get vaccinated because we don't trust it.
1/1	You lord Jesus, gave humans the knowledge to develop vaccines to save people's lives. Science isn't anti religion, so it makes no sense that people who are religious are so anti science..
1/1	You made a choice not to get vaccinated, but 10 Billion doses have been administered, safest vaccine rollout in the world, and you are still whining about the choice you made. 90% of drivers who actually cross the border *are* vaccinated, & lots of work for you elsewhere.
0/0	You made a huge mistake. You just altered you dna.if it dont effect you it will effect your children...if you will be able to have any.
0/0	You may also get cancer or die in a year or two of a violent reaction to something that used to be harmless to you (some scientists have suggested this). Who knows? Also, we will NOT be free to do whatever we want regarding the vaccine, as you will soon see.
1/1	You may have missed a lot of good news about another vaccine today ‚úì No CVST or thrombotic events, > 64.5 million doses ‚úì 95% protection vs severe infections in extended 6 mo f/u of 900 cases in main trial ‚úì Progress for vaccine vs B.1. 351, and kids https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-provides-clinical-and-supply-updates-covid-19-vaccine
1/1	You may not die from covid but someone else could therefore you need to take the vaccin, to protect others!
0/0	You mean sticking a vile of the coronavirus directly into your bloodstream isn't helping.... Shocker üò®
0/0	You mean the Covid-19 vaccines that don't work?',
1/0	You mean to say vaccines work?! But what about Bill Gates and tracking you?! I was sure they had a strong argument he was up to something!
0	You mean when you attempt to force People against their will, they will rebel by any means necessary.
0/0/0	You mean, who will take the vaccine. No thx, I‚Äôll take a pass on that one.
1/1	You might as well buy your coffin off of Amazon. Just get your vaccines, will ya?
1/1	You might die without the vaccine shot, but it‚Äôs your call
1/1	You might have serious long term side effects. But you might have serious long term side effects from all of them. It is impossible to know this as none of the vaccines have been around long term. Perhaps Pfizer and Moderna will cause deadly cancer in all recipients in 10 years time, and it wont happen to anyone with other vaccines. Extremely unlikely but who knows? Nobody. What we do know is COVID-19 is deadly and kills or seriously debilitates people, even younger people at times. And as we have already seen cases of COVID "longhaulers," there are likely many awful long-term issues with COVID that we will find out about in the future as well. I think it is wise to side with the vaccines, as from what we know, unvaccinated people who contract the virus tend to be the ones dying.
0/0	You might see claims that the COVID-19 vaccine can make someone infertile or impotent, harm a developing fetus in the womb, make the immune system attack the placenta, or hurt a baby who is breastfeeding from a recently vaccinated mother.
0/0	You morons. Omikron is not an issue regatding hospitalizations. Mandates ate nonsense and dangerous intervention in basic human rights regarding the own body. The individual decision to reject a forced medical treatment without any personal or sociatal benefit for anybody, has to be protected by any means.
1/1	You most likely were already vaccinated as a baby but if you are dumb enough to not vaccinate a child and you want to return to times where 1 out of 3 kids die before reaching the teenage years then there is something wrong with the way you are thinking. Please look up all the studies proving vaccinations are safe and you will realize all these anti vaxxers are complete and total morons without one ounce of common sense
0/0/0	You must be a brainless sheep to take a vaccine for a flu virus with over 99.5% survival rate
0/0	You must be so proud of your vaccine procurement... disgusting
0/1	You must be vaccinated, the Mercury has blocked your brain cells.
0/0	You must state things as they really are. This is NOT a vaccine, it is an experimental drug, untested, unproven over time.It does not meet the medical definition of a 'vaccine'.
1/1	You need at least 70% of people to take the vaccine to get rid of it so just giving it to elderly and people with pre existings isn‚Äôt enough, as someone with health conditions I really hope people won‚Äôt be selfish and take it so people like me and the elderly can go back to normal lives
0/0	You need to develop a vaccine that does not put people at dangerous risks of blood clots, strokes, anaphylactic shock, bells palsy and heart disease.
1	You need to help Brazil! COVID is ravaging the country, you need to get vaccines to them!
1/1	You need to inject and youre ready to effect and wait the results if its injected vacc√≠ne is effect√≠v√© to you. Pray faith and believe. God blessed us.
1/1	You need to take the vaccine and protect yourself and those around you.
1/1	You never lost your freedom. Sorry protecting your friends and family is such an inconvenience to you
1/1	You only have to vaccinate the kids you want to keep.
1/1	You people better get Vaccinated before it's too late.
1/1	You people got vaccine when you was a kid your Tb.your polo shot and others you did ok this one is no different
0/0	You people have no idea what goes on. Covid does not have any affects on the brain. The false info the media pushes is just insane. The SARS virus has been around for years and years. Shove the vaccine. Poison
0/0	You people realize these vaccines are not even FDA approved yet, and you want to force people to take them anyway? No long term studies, many people are having some awful side affects, and you can‚Äôt wait to give these to children babies and others who are low risk, because you don‚Äôt want to lower your chances of hospitalization by working on your own preventable diseases.
0/0	You prepare yourselves to change the DNA you the sons of devil we don't like such kind of vaccination in our pipeline
1/1	You put protections in place for your technology, give your health the same courtesy. Get vaccinated against the COVID-19. Stay Healthy
0/0	You raced making flu shots more than 70 yrs ago, and you made. But what happened since then? Did flu disappear? Oh yes, it did. It got a new name: Covid19.
1/1	You read that all the time with people dying of covid. "I should have taken the vaccine"
1/1	You really can't fix stupid. They're just going to hurt themselves and sadly people with weakened immune systems. If they could be tried for murder, I'd wager they'd get it pretty quick.
1/1	You really can‚Äôt reason/use logic with an anti vaxxer. Most of them I‚Äôve spoken to don‚Äôt know (in simple terms) how a vaccine works. Lmao
0/0	You really have blind faith in a system that you don‚Äôt even understand how it works. You have some seriously misconstrued ideas. And you are not nearly as safe as you think you are.
0/-1	You really love this idea... it's getting hit about every day now‚Ä¶ Soon we'll all be showing our papers to the nice men with the guns.
1/1	You refuse vaccine, when you get Covid, you do not have any care in a hospital as you have put many other people at risk.
0/0	You remember D.A.R.E in school and they taught us about peer pressure and drugs. I was peer pressured to get the vaccine more In the last two weeks than I was for any illegal drugs in my entire life.
0/0	You see all the Photo's of Biden & Others high up getting their Covid Shot I don't buy it for a minute it's all for a photo shoot fake I'm sure it's a B-12 Shot or other. They think if you see them getting their shot you will run out and get yours How Stupid do they think most are? They are hoping all the Sheep will line up for the Slaughter in droves.
0	You seem to be overlooking the T and B cell response that natural infection gives rise to. I hope this video isn't deliberately omitting relevant data to present the political point of view of the creators in a more favourable light.
1	You shold thank the pharma companies they will save us with these vaccines
1/1	You should be allowed to print someones tweet about how vaccines are bad and race them to the doctor and steal their vaccine when the time comes. If they come back with a printout of you saying sketchy stuff in 2011 it blocks it though
1/1	You should be glad for vaccines. Imagine smallpox came back?
0/0	You should be in prison for forcing that cocktail on your kid.
0/0	You should be worried after you take jab cuz it will end up.killing everyone within 3 years so if you think.its worth your life then go for it
0/0	You should drink a glass of water rather than taking this vaccine.
1/1	You should get the vaccine. Don‚Äôt believe the conspiracy theorists
0/0	You should have never Injected the chinese Plauge into your veins.... whenever you hear the word CHINESE with a product, The very second thought is FAKE PRODUCT.....
1/1	You should literally require proof of vaccination (perhaps on your ID) or a doctor's note saying you cannot be safely vaccinated in order to access certain public spaces and services
0/0	You should never be forced to put something in your body if you do not want to. I do not care how safe it may be. You should not have to, especially if it only benefits yourself and nobody else. 99% survival rate. Lets just move on people.
1/1	You should not have the right to become a host to a potentially deadly virus and then infect others by exposing them to yourself in pubic spaces. If you don‚Äôt want the vaccination then take responsibility for your decision and self isolate..
1/-1	You should say vaccinated the right vaccine though
1/1	You should still get the COVID-19 vaccine even if you‚Äôve had a previous infection. The vaccine acts as a booster that strengthens the immune response.
1/1	You should take the vaccine anyway because its more effective that way
0/-1	You shouldn't dismiss those people that are wary of a new vaccine as nut jobs. The swine flu vaccine had a 1/70 000 odds of giving people narcolepsy, something that was not known until long after. 1 year of testing is not enough time to accurately gauge these long-term risks. Narcolepsy is life-altering, you can't live a normal life after. If the Covid vaccine has the same odds, I for sure won't take it. I think many people here in Sweden will not since the narcolepsy issues became so news worthy here. If I were in a risk group, then probably but as a young person, it is not so obvious.
0/0	You shouldn‚Äôt have trusted the science or the liars in government so quickly. Funny because I have zero jabs including the flu ever. Zero sickness. You should be pissed because you are the one spreading it not me. Yet so many on this conversation are so proud. Why?
0/0	You shout not take those mRNA shots, It‚Äôs worthless and useless as Fauci himself.
0/0	You take it and all your friends and family. I'll see what happens at least 5 years down the track. 30 years research on these types of vaccines, no success, in less than a year, success, bingo, suspicious?
1/1	You take the shot not for yourself but for other people too!
1/1	You the man I got both shots no side effects but this keeps me assured. Thank you so much!
0	You think the big pharma make vaccine out of kindness? No it is to make money! Wake up!
0/0	You trusted Johnson + Johnson baby powder/ They knew it had asbestos. You gonna trust this?
1/1	You turn up and what is in stock is what you are getting. I got the Pfizer vaccine and had zero side effects. Love it!
0/-1	You two youngsters have certainly drank the kool-aid. Do you do ANY research yourself or do you just believe what you are told? Never mind, i know the answer to that question. Sure hope no one listens to you, but unfortunately, i know some will.
0/0	You vaccinated still spread it and get it. When will you start making sense??
1	You vile anti-vax lowlifes are responsible for the deaths of probably thousands of gullible people. How you sleep at night is beyond me. Shame on you all.
0/-1	You wanna see ‚ÄúMind Control‚Äù? Tell your parents you are not vaccinating your child... And SEE...
1/1	You want a normal life again? Then take the vaccine!
0/-1	You want to know the cure? Stop watching the media.
0/0	You want to know why it's rollout has been so bad? It's hard to get the nasty stuff they put in the vaccine, that's why. They have to wait for the chinese to send it over.
1/1	You want to return to a normal life? Get vaccinated.
1/1	You weaken our nation, get vaccinated ffs. Give back.
1/1	You were thorough and put my mind at ease regarding the vaccine. I wish I had a doctor like you who explained things with so much passion and compassion.
1/1	You were very brave once again. It looks like maybe a vaccine for covid will be required every year because it keeps mutating. Probably a small price to pay as long as it keeps everyone safe. Thank you for your valuable information and for putting yourself out there everyday. Stay safe until your vaccine kicks in. Impressive drumming by the way.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0	You will NOT put ANYTHING in MY BODY, NOTHING. I DECIDE WHAT GOES IN MY BODY.
0/0	You will NOT put ANYTHING in MY BODY, NOTHING. I DECIDE WHAT GOES IN MY BODY.fdfdfdf
0/0	You will never put this drug into my child's body! I'll deal with covid, my family will deal with covid. You touch my child, you die. I'm not sorry. If I could sue you for a bad reaction, then I would start to re think my position
1/1	You will think, ‚Äúwhat was all the fuss about.‚Äù Just do it and be protected.
1/1	You won't die The news reports the spectacular and exceptional which scares you. Millions of people have had it and there is 1 POSSIBLE death. You have a greater chance of winning something in the lotto. lol. Fear governs society.
1/1	You won't get the vax? then stay the hell home and don't be around anyone.
1/1	You wont have the advantage of maximal immunity, if you don‚Äôt take the second shot. So its not dangerous, but if you felt more-or-less fine after the first shot, there's not a good reason to skip the second
0/0/0	You won‚Äôt need to because half of that number won‚Äôt want it , me included , cheers
0/0	You would be a fool to take an untested unresearched vaccine
0/0	You would be crazy to take an experimental vaccine. Just Google Pfizer criminal history.
0/0	You would have to be an idiot to let them inject you with something they rushed together.
0/0	You would have to be insane, or coerced, into getting an experimental jab while pregnant, or thinking of getting pregnant.
0/0	You would have to be mad if you're young fit and healthy to get the vaccine. Ill take my chances with a runny nose and a light cough.
1/0	You would need to be a very brave person to stand in front of me and tell me that I have to take the vaccine.
0	You would not want to vaccinate your kids because all vaccines are full of toxins and poisons.
0/0/0/0	You'd have to be a damn fool to get that fast-tracked vaccine.
0/0	You'd have to be nuts to get that shot, absolutely loco. Whenever authorities are pushing something, that's a red flag there's a hidden agenda, especially when it's global which merely serves as the legit angle for the false flag operation.
0/0	You'll regret taking it in a couple of years when the side effects show up
1/1	You're 1000 times more likely to die of COVID than vaccine side effects.
1/0	You're a doctor, you have to give the good example
0/0/0/0/0	You're allowed to question medicine. But not vaccines. Never vaccines!
1/1	You're always this patriotic. So now be it again and take the vaccine asap
0/0	You're an absolute fool if you take any of these vaccines.
0/0	You're basically rolling a dice with your health at stake.
0/0	You're concerned about getting #COVID but you're not at all concerned about being injected with it? That makes sense.
0/0	You're cute too. Funny how you think the pharma. industry doesn't make money off of forcibly required vaccines for old childhood illnesses 99.9% of kids got at school and didn't die, or go deaf, called the measles ect. People will be just as freaked out about chicken pox in ten years. I used to work for the CDC, I know the politics that comes out of there, and none of these shots are necessary. Basically, you are defending the idea of forcing a parent to play russian roulette with a vaccine, that I'm sorry to inform you, does cause autism, and other nasty things, so that your kid won't get something akin to the damn chicken pox. The CDC has been busted lying already, and the people who have come out against them, I am confident, one day, will be vindicated. You are the one that has bought into the scare tactics. If you think there aren't also plans to make money treating the effects of these vaccines, think again. Children also develop life long immunity when they are allowed to get these illnesses, and they are not going to die. You will not have life long immunity with a vaccine, no matter what they tell you. Go ahead and get yourself tested. See if you are still immune to all the crap they 'vaccinated' you for as a child. I will bet money that you aren't immune. They will tell you 'some adults' need a second or third shot... because the truth is we all do, and the truth is, the majority of people will never know they are not immune. Also, good luck finding the group of unvaccinated Orthodox Jews and Amish people that came down with the measles, in the last few years just so CDC could have a few American cases. They don't exist, and these are people who would otherwise have no idea the government is blaming them for disease outbreaks. I believe the Nazis did the same thing.
1/1	You're good with the Moderna at around 75%. Not excellent, but decent protection if you're in a high risk area.
1/1	You're just upset the vaccines work.
0/0	You're not alone Jack.There are millions of us not taking this farce.Sit tight and hang in to your intuition.It is your greatest protection.
1/1	You're not someone whoever got infected with covid19 virus or its life threatening complications. Antivaxxers are the dumbest people you will ever meet.
0/0	You're not supposed to take it while pregnant or breastfeeding. What an overwhelmingly huge bummer, I guess I have no choice but to wait the next 15 years before I take it. Maybe we'll actually have data on long-term side effects by then...
0/0	You're not vaccinating populations, you're vaccinating individuals. Individuals with free will don't want to take a vaccine that can kill them.
1/1	You're phase 1 because your work helps more than just yourself. Keeping you healthy increases your ability to treat the rest of us that can't get the vaccine yet.
0/0/0/0/0	You're presenting theories as facts. mRNA technology has not been adequately or unequivacably proven. I do not want a chemical messing with my immune system. I'll boost my system naturally thank you.
1/1	You're spending too much time online really. The vaccine worked, Look where we are now?
1/1	You've made the best argument for the vaccine I've heard yet.
1/1	YouTube could do a hell of a lot more to combat misinformation spread by anti-vax conspiratorial videos.
0/0	Youd be a DAMN FOOL to take this vaccine
1	Young and healthy people can get very sick, too
1/1	Young and healthy people can still get very sick from covid. I don't want to take unnecessary risks and will get the vaccine.
0/0	Young healthy people have died. AFTER "vaccination"
0/0	Young healthy people have died. AFTER "vaccination".
0/0	Young people are the real target of this poison.
0/-1	Young soccer/football players in the U.K. Have died from heart failure caused by the vaccine. All of them were under 30 and last I checked there was 3 of them out of less than 1000 pro players.
0/0	Young soccer/football players in the UK have died from heart failure caused by the vaccine.
0/0	Young women have virtually zero chance of dying from covid if they are healthy! Why are they taking it?
0/0/0	Young women who plan to have children someday shouldn‚Äôt take this vaccine yet. It hasn‚Äôt been tested long enough.
1/1	Younger people need to come out of their overconfidence of stronger immune system and get vaccinated to save themselves as well as stop spreading the virus to the more vulnerable people.
0/1	Your "advice" is .... "dont listen to any negative things about it, everyone has to have it" ... cool that seems like an unbiased, responsible response
1/0	Your Covid19 vaccine is excellent. In a family of 5 where one of the member got both doses and was exposed to the virus 25 days after getting the 2nd dose. All the family tested positive except for the vaccinated member.
0/0	Your Government are killing you all.. yes killing you all read that again and again and again.. comply YOU WILL DIE simple as.. vaccines KILL end all NOW..
0/0	Your Not Vaccinating Me! I AM NOT Taking Any Covid-19 Vaccines! There Is No Covid-19 Pandemic This Is a Plandemic! Your vaccinations are In line with depopulation
0/0	Your a COMPLETE IDIOT if you trust vaccines ESPECIALLY THIS ABOMINATION COVID VACCINE!
0/0	Your body does this naturally, no jab required.
0/0	Your body does this without a dangerous drug
0/0	Your body has its own immune system. Let it do its job. If you're healthy you should be fine. Why do I want to put some man made concoction in my body. SMH
1/-1	Your body will only be able to adapt, adjust & heal if you first understand what it takes to keep it healthy.
0/-1	Your body, your choice. But stop gaslighting those who understand that poison is NOT a cure for poison. Their body, their choice. They are anti vaxxers for the same reason people don't pet angry rattlesnakes.
0/0	Your body, your choice. The vaccine does not keep you from getting covid or spreading it.
1/1	Your boy just got his second vaccine shot. I‚Äôm two weeks away from going to a Yankees game and being totally confused about what is safe to do or not to do as a fully Covid vaccinated human.
0/0	Your chance of death from the vaccine is the same as from the virus. So I will take my chance with the virus.
1/-1	Your chances of getting blood clots in general is 2 per 1,000. So less than 1 out of 1,000,000 potential from the J&J vaccine and there is a pause? So much for science, math and common sense. Someone must have a stake in Pfizer big time.Trump is right.Pure politics
1/1	Your chances of getting covid and dying or becoming a long hauler are MUCH greater than any issues you could have from the vaccine. There are people dying every day with regrets about not getting the vaccine. Dont be one of them.
1/1	Your child cannot get COVID-19 from any COVID-19 vaccine, including the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.
1/1	Your child may get a COVID-19 vaccine and other vaccines, including flu vaccine, at the same time.
1/1	Your decision about whether or not to get vaccinated is not just about yourself ... This is a 'love your neighbor' moment. https://t.co/koWOkF6BaS
1/1	Your decision to not get vaxxed affects other people by filling hospital beds and taking up resources (not to mention making new variants more likely). But you still want to exercise your right to not get vaxxed? Fine. Just sign a waiver that if you catch COVID, you agree and acknowledge that you will be deprioritized when it comes to hospital and ICU admittance as well as other resources (e.g. ventilators). Problem solved.
0/0	Your doctor recommend you get a second shot? Common sense would tell you definitely NOT
1/-1	Your family and coworkers need you
0/0	Your father is now a genetically modified organism. You can be very proud.
1/1	Your gal is joining the workforce as a HCSW - Vaccinator in the fight against COVID-19
0/0	Your government hates you and will kill you to protect its vaccine empire. It will kill you to maintain control. Hate it back.
1/1	Your healthy immune system is not going to protect you from covid19 because it has never come across that particular pathogen before and it is therefore not primed to eliminate it.
1/1	Your idiotic anti-vax crap is ignorant and insane.
0/-1	Your immune system can now protect you from Covid
0/0	Your immune system does that without making corporations very rich
0/0	Your immune system is the best way to protect yourself!!!
0/0	Your immune system works BEST
0/0	Your kids can get hurt by this vaccine
1/1	Your last line brought a tear to my eye. I am ready for this to be over too, I'm ready for people to stop dying, I'm ready for my parents to be able to hug and kiss their grand children. I'm ready for the world to be safe again.
0/0	Your natural antibodies are more important than an artificial substance.
0/0	Your natural immune system is best
0/0	Your natural immune system is stronger than any vaccine
0/0	Your not going to tell me that out of 6 million shots one person a had a fatality and there're pulling the drug. There is more here they are not telling us.
0/-1	Your obedience is prolonging this nightmare
1/1	Your odds of getting a blood clot from Covid vs the vaccine is exponentially higher
0/-1	Your own Immunity is the best Vaccine!
0/0	Your priority should be concentrated on providing sufficient food and healthy water for poor countries before marketing the vaccines.
0/0	Your propaganda is disgusting. We don't get healthy by filling our bodies with toxins. Likewise, we don't get sick from an absence of pharmaceuticals.
1/1/1/1	Your reply and info is appreciated. So much clear info re covid-19 and vaccines means I will get vaxxed.
0/-1	Your right their both a pair of sanctimonious hypocrites But maybe they both realise that the whole thing is a load of mass hysteria and like almost 100% of people in the country they have nothing to be worried about so were just getting on with their lives
1/0	Your safer getting the flu vaccine because it gives a small immune boost and it‚Äôs been around longer sorry not sorry . Covid vaccine can wait
1	Your strong immune system also needs to be "tuned" to recognize the virus. Otherwise it takes too long to respond to the new threat.
0/0	Your vaccine is experimental many side effect.. God will judge you.
1/1	Your very good video has taken away my fear of vaccination. got my first shot today. Thank you for your factual and good information!
0/0	You‚Äôd think the jabbed would start asking questions by now
0/0	You‚Äôll never force me to get anything I don‚Äôt deem safe into my body. Just like the flu shot which contains a small amount of mercury which can‚Äôt be taken out of your body ever. No thanks give the Jab to someone else who wants it!
1/1	You‚Äôre an idiot, vaccines have saved millions of lives. Get out of your basement and get a fuse if reality.
0/0	You‚Äôre gonna trust a vaccine that was made in a year or less even though it takes years of research that‚Äôs why we can‚Äôt find the cure of other diseases huh. bill gates helping with the vaccine even tho he‚Äôs been very open about population control. Interesting.
0/0	You‚Äôre immune system is still more effective than the covid vaccine
0/-1	You‚Äôre not in hospital. It is by definition mild.
0/0	You‚Äôre not making me inject that evil into my body. Let‚Äôs all pray right now. Literally!
1/0	You‚Äôre not understanding the point. It is still more likely to be harmed by the vaccine than the virus. End of story. So stop saying that the spike proteins vaccines are not harmful
1/1	You‚Äôre protecting those who cannot be vaccinated
1	You‚Äôre still glad you got all those vaccines when you were a kid, right? So get one against COVID. Please inform yourself before spreading misinformation.
0/-1	You‚Äôre tortured by vaccine ? Just.. don‚Äôt.
1/1	You‚Äôre. Also I‚Äôd rather take any long term vaccine effects than face possible lung scarring.
1/1/1	Yup and feeling great. I'm immune compromised and was able to get it earlier than most in my age group. So thankful #CovidVaccine
0/0	Yup let‚Äôs just genetically modify our cells and just hope it goes well
0/0	Yup, don‚Äôt have kids but if I‚Äôd did have there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôd have given consent for them to be jabbed.
0/0	Yup, everywhere people got the jab people get covid. The jab is the virus!!!! At least its mostly dem cities where this occurs‚Ä¶
1/1	Yup, having those flu like symptoms right now. If this is how my body reacts to the shot, I can't imagine how terrifying and painful contracting actual covid would be. So glad I'll be all protected by moving day.
0/0	Yup.. Still not taking jt.
1/1	Y‚Äôall I‚Äôm so thankful that I‚Äôm vaccinated. I‚Äôve been down and out with covid all week, and all I can think about it how much worse it could‚Äôve been because of comorbid disorders I am diagnosed with. It could‚Äôve been so much worse. I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs almost over. Whoosh.

0/0	ZAMBIAN PRESIDENT IS AWAKE.... and he is warning his people to NOT take the vaccine
1/0	Zero Covid is incredibly easy to achieve. Getting to minimal cases more so. As many counties are proving. We just don't have the discipline. We have a narcissistic culture instead. Many don't have the intellectual capacity to do what needs to be done. So we're relying on vaccines
0/0	Zero side effects from covid, myocarditis from the faulty vax. Sounds like Pfizer punkd yall
0/0	Zero vaccines here, just like I don't get any others. Had Covid. Was mehh sick for a few days. Eat healthy. Exercise. Am not a lardass or have a co morbidity or immuno deficiency. Happy to live my life like usual. Cheers to the rest of you.
0/0	Zero would be the number of vaccines you need.
1/1	Zombie movies make way more sense, now. I can totally believe a zombie plague would collapse society. Nobody stays in the house when the government says there are flesh eating zombies outside, and even if they cure it, huge segments of the population won't take it.
0/0	Zombie stage one.
0/0	Zombie vaccine coming soon, you take that shot I will load my magazines
0/0	Zombies by 2021? Wouldn't even surprise me.
1/-1	[are these vaccines safe? The answer is yes, ] Except that all of them are technically experimental vaccines at this point. Maybe it's necessary to allow people to try experimental vaccines during a pandemic. But we shouldn't pretend they are not experimental vaccines. Also, though, why begin to administer them in nations where the pandemic has already reached a projected course of natural deline
0/0	\"Covid-19 activated by face mask\" 3:37\nThe most stupidest thing I've ever heard.

1/1	a 90 year old vaccinated man : dies antivax moms : IT'S THOSE DAMN VACCINES !
1/1	a corona infection also brings with it health risks and, depending on age, these are significantly higher than those of vaccination. And those who do not get vaccinated will eventually become infected, that much is certain.
0/0	a fast tracked vaccine where the company's developing it have immunity against future claims it and maybe when long term problems emerge. you take it, I'm wait thanks.

1/-1	a strong mind is a healthy mind, strong body is a very healthy body, take your shots, beat cancer
0/1	a vaccine cannot protect you completely from a virus, it can only lessen your symptoms if you happen to contract the virus, that is why there is no 100% efficacy. say, people who gets flu vaccine shots still gets sick once in a while but with lesser flu symptoms. and yes, the vaccine contains the weaker version of the virus cells itself.
0/0	a vaccine for something that has a 99.8% recovery. absurd beyond belief
0/0	a vaccine that has more short term side effects then the virus. We do not know about the long term side effects. No Worry there will be plenty of pills to sell for the vaccines side effects and more pills for those pills side effects. Thanks but No Thanks!!

1/1	actually i hope i will get a mRNA vaccine rather than vector virus.
1/1	actually it's been proven that vaccinated kids are more likely to have autism, because the ones that aren't vaccinated are dead

0/0	again that's a lie. vaxxed are spreading covid just as much as unvaxxed
0/0	again why only focussed on vaccines why are you unable to look for alternatives . when the cases go down we don't want your vaccines. we need treatments. focus on our well-being use your time and energy for both. vaccinion is gone it doesn't work any more look at Israel. go and look to communicate early treatments!
1/1	age 76 and 42 days past my 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine and no side effect with either dose

1/1	all i can say is to def get vaccinated!!! the symptoms have been passing by me so fast bc i am fully vaccinated. all of them are mild and it isnt even as bad as a regular fever bc of that. the vaccine is definitely worth it
0/0	all my coworkers went and got the covid vaccine today and made some post sounding like they didn‚Äôt want to but it was ‚Äúdoing their part to get their students back.‚Äù I could never.

1/-1	all staff of medical field should they take it
1/1	all the front line workers should be vaccinated first they have and still are risking own lives to save others
0/0	all the time they spent on cancer ,and nothing are they really trying to find a cure for cancer. What about the command cold still nothing are they really trying to cure the command cold . You see why people are so skeptical
0/0	all these people having the jab will be dead sooner or later from one of these jabs or be future cyborgs controlled by a.i and the only people that will be lefted will be those who didnt have the jab thats if they dont put this poison in the food supply as well humanity is in great danger unless it wakes it arse up in large scale numbers other wise humanity could be on it way out there will be no humans lefted on this earth only cyborgs
1/1	all these people who didn‚Äôt finish school and can‚Äôt spell or use grammar are saying the vaccine is bad
1/1	all those anti vax will appricate the vaccine a few years later
1/1	all vaccines that are available in your country are well tested and effective
1/-1	all we can hope for is a broad spectrum vaccine to be developed over the next few years if possible
1/1	along with the infection rates, the anti vaxx sentiment has also spiked. i blame general distrust in the governments and the lack of education around this new type of vaccine, especially in the older generations who might not have access to educational resources / not speak english
1/1	already got my booster shot !
0/0	already had covid wasnt even bad no thanks.
0/0	also my housemate here in uk said his wife who works at hospital refused vaccine, for half of old people in care home died after vaccine. I believe her. Why would believe advertising in tv, and all censored news, when someone tells as it is. That f.cking gene therapy clearly states, that long term effects are not known! That is why you sign the risks!!! You can not sue! But that is pointless after you die anyway .......
0/0	also you fear mongering shills always talk about the long term effect of COVID. of which none are proven so far. but completely ignore the potential long term effects of an experimental vaccine. For example. the very likely effect on fertility. as this is mostly likely being used for population control.
0/0	am (sadly) austrian and I reached the point that all I want, is to leave this terrible country. There is no free mind anymore, you get looks for sayin that you dont agree with the vaccine and eventually even pushed out of groups. To be honest, my country was great I was happy here. Never thought that I need to flee from my own country to escape this madness. I hope my wife and I can make it to a better place.
0/0	am a human being. My immune system is exclusively mine. I am not cattle to be injected and used for profits by pharma. I was not created to be an immunologically-manipulated human shield for others. MY BODY- MY CHOICE

1/1	and the 780000 dead from it would tell you to get vaccinated..
0/0	and the scam goes on
0/0	and there are studies and actual human experiences where vaccinated kids were sicker than unvaccinated kids ‚Ä¶ some experiments were conducted within the same family to record over years the sickness and time it takes to recover.

1/1	anti vax brother refusing to drive me to my vaccine appointment so now i gotta walk an hour
0/0	anti vax for life. Everyone else should be too. Vaccines are awful. Stay pure
0	anti vax is a collective term thought of by politicians and governement paid off scientists and experts to give people who don't want the vaccine a bad name, and shame them as some sort of conspiracy figure, when infact we are more concerned about what is going in our bodies from an experimental drug with no long term studies done.

1/1	anti-vaxxers are so dumb. They'll eat processed shit they get off of walmart shelves all day but they won't get vaccinated. I guess this is what happens when people don't get polio for 50 years, they think it must not exist.

0/0	any parent that gives this crap to their kids is failing them on every level!

0/0	are they going to force your to take vaccines if you dont want it and you are a health person ..I think soooooo.
1/1	are you a qualified medical practitioner? I think the experts in the field have worked it all out and i am very happy to have the vaccine to protect my loved ones as are most unselfish people posting on here today. Its called science
1/1	as I told another user we would be foolish and a half to not utilize AZN in other cases especially after seeing its efficacy against B.1.1.7. It‚Äôs still useful to us. And I expect our mRNA vaccines will absolutely hold up. See Pfizer‚Äôs results.
1/0	as a child in the 60's we had to have shots to go to school. our parents never questioned it they just said yes. now everything is political and politics is killing people.
1	as a former nurse I see nothing wrong with mask mandates and encourage everyone to get vaccinated.
0/-1	as a large business owner i respect my employees right to Choose what is best for them. yes i have had managers go behind my back and try to install mandates and whatnot, but they have been fired

1/1	as someone who got corona before the vaccine was out: i would do anything to have my sense of smell and taste go back to normal. get vaccinated!
1/1	as someone who got the full vaccine and booster, it‚Äôs a little off-putting (cold-like symptoms) for about 3 days to a week after getting the shots but after that it‚Äôs completely fine. also, i wear my mask whenever i go out and i haven‚Äôt gotten covid once
0/0	ask bill gates you moron, he brags about putting gmo in vaccines and kiling people with it but i guess you find out the hard way wont you little sheep?
1/1	at first i was skeptical due to the sheer speed the vaccine was developed but after seeing millions get vaccinated with minor to non existent side effects i decided to go ahead with it.
0/0/0	at greater risk for what? For catching a virus that for most people is less dangerous than the common cold? Taking the vaccine is much riskier, but if you want to take it, go right ahead!
0/0	avoid vaccine at all costs
1/1	avoiding all vaccines because you had a bad reaction... is like avoiding all fruit because you ended up being allergic to apples..
0/0	back then i think vaccines did save lives because they were not in the hands of psychos unlike today.
0/0/-1	because for my race they make a different vaccine
0/0	because its a lie that these shots make the world safe... consider your country lucky!
0/-1	because of the fact that people participating in a phase 3 trial have to volunteer- people who got those experimental vaccines most likely were less likely to get covid in the first place. that‚Äôs my biggest concern
0/0	because the VAX doesn't work
1/-1	because the vacine doesnt prevent TRANSMISSION. it just means you are less likely to die from covid. unfortunately once people get the vaccine they get careless and allow covid to transmit among vaccinated allowing the virus to mutate and eventually beat the vaccine
0/-1	because they dont care if you die in agony. this is all about profit
0/-1	been hearing a lot of covered up death rates after taking the vaccine. anyone have any thought on that claim ?

0/0	bullshit and when you do get a serious side effect guess what these docs wont help you youre going straight to the emergency room where you might get infected and who knows then what
0/0	but could you please explain why individuals with natural immunity still need to be vaccinated?
1/1	but it is safer and easier if you achieve herd immunity from vaccines
0/0	but not the covid vaccine, not the one that has to be forced, not the one that has proven to have dangerous side effects of heart attacks and stokes... Why would if be right and responsible to do that, for a vaccine that has a tiny margin of usefullness?
0/0	but the thing is, mRNA vaccine modifies our body in the DNA level, and this is kind of vaccine that the scientist never used before, so we don't really know the side effects in the future
0/0	but the vaccinated are still getting sick and spreading the virus. So tell me again how this new ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù works so well?
0/0/0	but why anyone can not come up with a cancer care. How can they come up a vaccine so quickly for covid 19.??????
1/1	by not getting vaccine you jeopardise others with weaker immunity system

0	caught Covid last year, cared for myself at home, recovered & returned to my job. I have been exposed to known Covid multiple times since then and have never once been re-infected. I will defer the vaccine to someone who wants it. You‚Äôre welcome America, I have done my part.
0/-1	cautiously optimistic. So cautious tears.
0/0	cdc data at least 273 deaths and 9,845 adverse events to covid-19 vaccine thus far
0/-1	cdc data shows how many died from covid alone. It's not millions. Far from it. Why didn't so many die? Good immune system. Nothing to do with luck
0/0	chances of dying from lightning are also way higher then chances of dying from covid statistically speaking lol.
1/1	check the difference compared to last year. The vaccines have worked. In terms of vaccine mandates, that‚Äôs unnecessary in my opinion but unfortunately some developed countries have a low vaccine uptake thanks to scare stories and misinformation.
1/1	children are being hospitalised by covid. Not may are dying. Being hospitalised is bad enough to merit a vaccine.
0/0	claiming that 'now we have vaccines that work' 10:20 , is contrary to what is being told by the vaccine manufacturers themselves. No one 'knows' that the vaccines work. It's just a good guess, and will take 'time' to confirm.

0/0	companies whose only other products are Gene Treatments‚Ä¶ Some won't because it is KNOWN that the vaccine causes infertility, for an unknown period of time, possibly for life.
1/1	congrats!! I can't wait til I can receive mine. It makes sense that younger people would experience more symptoms since their immune system is better, so theirs is on high alert, the older you get it just seems like it takes more to aggravate it... perhaps the immune system is just like someone who has seen a lot of hardship in their lives, they don't react as angrily to an incident.

0/0	do not allow these poor babies to be vaccinated
0/1	do not encourage people to not take the vaccine
0/0	do not get this death needle
0/0	do not need to get the shot.
0/0	do pro-vaxers even realize how corrupt the industry is? to start, look into pfizer‚Äôs criminal history. they are habitual offenders of illegal marketing practices by bribing physicians and suppressing adverse trial results. they are literally HIDING the bad reactions to make their product seem ‚Äúsafe.‚Äù you can argue about the ‚Äúscience‚Äù all day, but don‚Äôt even think logically about how the ‚Äúscience‚Äù they tell us is just what they WANT us to know. everyone can agree that the history being taught in schools is white-washed, this country wants us to believe we‚Äôre the greatest country in the world and leaves out a lot of history that would make us look bad. so why do you think science is any different? just bc someone went to medical school, it doesn‚Äôt mean they are taught the truth. just because a doctor tells you it‚Äôs safe, it doesn‚Äôt mean it is. the doctor passes on the information from big pharma which is heavily profiting off of making and keeping us sick, between all these vaccines and the chemicals in the food we eat. vaccine injury is real and not rare. if the media was feeding you vaccine injury stores the way they fed you covid stories, maybe people would have a bit more sympathy for the millions of people who were injured by vaccines. and to top it all off, vaccine manufacturers are liability free. if they injure you, you can‚Äôt sue them. after experiencing vaccine injury myself and seeing people close to me also experience it, i won‚Äôt be playing russian roulette with my body again.

0/0	first of all... the numbers have already been proven boosted... the flu randomly disappeared... along with all the deaths from heart disease lung disease etc... what happened ?! Did masks help people with bad hearts ?? Nah I don‚Äôt think so... what was the number or people that died strictly from covid ?? Not many... most had underlying issues and a lot were already on the way out... no I‚Äôm not insensitive either... I‚Äôm a realest and that‚Äôs just how life is... so now tell me why... if I‚Äôm healthy with no underlying conditions am I going to line up for a vaccination filled with shit u have no idea of short term or long term problems for a virus that IF I contract it I have a 99%+ chance to survive ??
0/0	flu vaccine took over a decade to bring to public, ask the experts if they will have the jab first and we can take it from there, that's not fake new on vaccines, I've had flu jab today. If the world has naturally produced a virus that has stopped the world (flu never stopped the world) how can a vaccine be found in the blink of eye ... nothing makes sense except we get the news we want to hear
0/0	flu vaccine, 100 years, still 40% effective and people die after getting it sometimes because it weakens their immune system. Vaccines are moronic if u take it EVERY YEAR.
0/0	flu vaccines don't work. this won't work as well.
1/1	following the recent announcement, am really keen to get the booster ASAP due to the rise of the 'Omicron' variant.

1/1	for all those that donet want to get the vaccines, bring them to us that we want..!! Haha more for us then!..
1	for me the only reason i got the vaccine is becuase i work directly with paients. Even i never got sick and never have the flu or anything. But i want to protect my mom and others elderly from it. I always mask up and stay 6 ft. but i still go out
1/-1	for people who already had COVID-19, those who do not get vaccinated after their recovery are more than 2 times as likely to get COVID-19 again than those who get fully vaccinated after their recovery.
0/0	for proof that vaccination is both useless and dangerous, read the folloiwng medical evidene from the most eminent physicians on europe.
1/1	for the un-vaxxed who die, I feel badly for the children left behind either with one parent or both gone. The children's lives are catastrophically upended and changed for ever. Ok, yes, vaxxed folks can die also, but at least they took the important step that could have prevented the virus.
1/0	for those who chose not to take it, that's fine, natural selection at this point. But I know y'all were also the ones complaining about no vaccine

0/0/0	gates is evil hes not even a doctor, has been sued billions by the indian and african respective goverments for his horrendous vaccines that caused polio and birth defects in over 600.000 indian children, and thr fatalities of 10 thousand African children under the age of 2 for a malaria jab. This may be censored info but it is accessible to anybody who has the ability to turn on there computer and use a non propaganda flitered search engine (duckduckgo. com for one) if you still either use google or only tune into bbc/sky news then not only are you ignorant, but you info from one source despite philosophers for generations that have preached about looking apon any given problem from different outlooks will grant you a better outlook - only citing one source becos it's "official" when every government in existence has been corrupt at 1 point or another, is not only ignorant, but shows u have an uneasy trust in strangerd. The better question to ask would be how do you undoubtedly trust a goverment that would keep open mcdonalds and shut gyms during a time when people will be at therr laziest and most mentally unstable? When there is a virus that will affect you the more unhealthy you are. Idc bout 0.0001 perfectly mortality rate ill take my chances as im sure 90% of the population would ‚úå

0/0	getting vaccinated when you're a healthy adult is retarded. there is no such thing as "long covid", that's simply depression and anxiety from being one of The Afflicted
1/1	gettting a thrombosis from this vaccine is less likely than you choking and dying on your own spit while reading this comment. AstraZeneca was paused for similar reasons and is resumed because the risk is so low. Same thing will happen with J&J.

0/0	has certain side effects
0/1	hat‚Äôs fair enough, but then if there is a vacine that a lot of countries are ruling out completely and Ireland has at present ruled it out for about 90% of its people, what makes it safe for around 10%. Or do that 10% matter, they have nothing to give anymore. https://t.co/W6TcQ8Tjxx

1/1	have taken the #vaccine Most have also covered their spouses. Thanks to the Health Department who made this possible. Beat #coronavirus
1/1/1	he COVID-19 vaccine will protect you and others from the virus and help us end this pandemic.
0/-1	he probably would have remained unvaccinated. His wife and son, who appear to have avoided Covid-19, aren‚Äôt vaccinated either.
1/1	he vaccine' survival rate is much higher than 99% -> so if you get the vaccine you have a 100% survivral rate to the Covid19 since you won't develop the severe forms of the disease.
0/0	he world will wake up and come together and ban 5g and that damn mirco chip, this is a world problem not just the USA, time to focus on what really matters. Don't vaccine
0/0	he ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù are not vaccines at all! They do not inoculate people who get jabbed, they just mitigate the symptoms but leave people susceptible to future infections once the antibodies wear off in as little as three months.
1/1/1	health care workers should be first for the needle
0/0	heared a group of people died after taking the vaccine!

0/-1	hell the vaccine won't even work. nothing stops this virus that kills nobody. Soon only 100% of us will remain
1/1	her dad made the choice for a logical reason and not because he is stupid enough to believe the false claims of the anti-vaxxers and call the vaccines ‚Äòexperimental‚Äô. You have to be a complete moron to believe that crap. Look it up.
1/1	herd immunity for the delta variant requires 80-90% immunity. We are only at 55% due to all the anti-vaxxers.
0/0	herd immunity takes effect and Covid goes extinct.
1	here in my country we are waiting in line to get turn for vaccine because vaccines is not enough
1/1	hes an anti vaxxer who paid the price for not having the vaccine
0/0	hey aren't safe yet for anyone. Criminally negligent at best you lot.
0/0	higher risk by not vaccinating? How so? Can you show me anything that supports that claim?
0/0	hint; ITS NOT TO BE USED AND BODY WILL REJECT IT AS IT IS CONFUSED. It is not working in the name of human health, it is in the name of depopulation - they are releasing it , and there is much resistance to it - 48% of the military still refusing to take the vaccine. INFORMED CONSENT is CRITICAL.
0/1	his has led to fears that the vaccines developed so far might not work against these new ‚Äúmutants‚Äù because vaccines are based on teaching the body to recognize those proteins and attack them in future.
0/-1/-1	hmmm I said to someone the day after having the Astra-Zeneca vaccine was that I felt like I had a blood clot. This was before the news about risks of blood clots. I'm a bit concerned about having the second dose :/
1/1	honestly i have no hope for anti-vax moms anymore. they have been proven so unbelievably wrong. vaccines have increased the lifespan of the average human (if vaccinated) by a lot, as there are a lot of vaccines especially for dangerous diseases
1/-1	honestly i saw a video about a vaccine in china and it seems to be coming along beautifully.
1/1	honestly im going to frame my vaccination card and put it next to my diploma

0/0	hopefully never
1/1	hopefully they ramp up the production during this review period, this way once the 26th comes we can flood the market and start vaccinating 3 million plus a week.. The light at the end of this very dark tunnel is approaching
0/0	hopefully they will rid of this vaccine passport bullshit so i can fly hom
0/1/0	how about I just wait for the vaccines that don't seemingly causes blood clots? like I've waited over a year I think ppl can wait a bit longer
0/0	how about we don't want to get deathly sick! I saw terrible side effects in people who got it
0/0	how about yall stop trying to stuff a vaccination down people throat that's not even a year old yet?
0/-1	how can a patient have INFORMED CONSENT - without full facts? many old have dementia they just trust others
0/0	how can one expect information from those who don't know? he who don't have cannot give. if they have not had enough time to study the virus or the vaccine how can they tell us what we need to know?
0/0	how can the government or media ever gain trust. they are a joke

1/0	how is it a so called vaccine? Science is supposed to change and have new technologies. I got 3 shots. I'm perfectly healthy with no problems and have never once tested positive for covid-19.
0/-1	how long are you going to run this scam and push the death jab
0/0	how much J&J pay you to push their trash vaccine?
0/1	how tf did they make this in less than a year while most of vaccines take years to complete
1/1	i actually find americans so irritating. if showering was invented today, i can guarantee some americans would be against it. like seriously just take the vaccine, do you want to spread the virus to vulnerable who will then die? no, you don‚Äôt- pure selfishness reclaimed as ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù.

TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE DYING AFTER TAKING IT SO I DO NOT CARE HOW FAST THEY MADE IT
0/0	i am sure the government kool-aid crowd will justify this death.... but it is a wakeup call for what they DONT know about this rushed vaccine. Maybe the cure is worse than the disease in some cases!
1/1	i am totally pro vaccine because it makes everyone safer but it's totally valid to not get anymore vaccines due to bad reactions or illnesses that make it dangerous for you to get vaccines. but the part of the population that can get vaccined without high risks should (in my opinion) get vaccined so that we can reach herd immuntity and secure everyone
0/0/0/0	i am very skeptical of it. i‚Äôm sorry i won‚Äôt get the vaccine. thats just my opinion
0/0	i can't believe this vaccine, no way to accept it.

1/1	i currently live with my family because i can't afford to move. they're all anti-vaxx :/ i wish i had the option to not hang around them.
1/1	i definitely agree, it should be mandated for travel so you dont get other people sick
1/1	i dont really care for what boris has to say but one thing i can agree with, is yes, anti vaxxers are nuts

0/0	i dont trust vaccination.
1/1	i dont want them to die but they sure as hell seem to want to. wed all be better off if theyd get vaccinated or , at least, wear a mask but they refuse to
0/0/0	i dont want your bloody vaccine
1/1	i find it hilarious how people who have no education on virology try to weigh in on why they go against doctors. its like asking for the advice of a child rather than a calculus professor when having a math question.
1/1	i get this vaccine if after i can travel again
1/1	i got Covid about a week after my booster! I only had a stuffy nose,a dry throat, minimal cough and fever. so greatful for the vaccine
1/1	i got a vaccine like 2-3 months ago and im fine.
1	i got my covid vax yesterday! i have bever felt netter
1/1	i got my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine today, so did my sibling and step siblings who were old enough to get it lol üë©ü¶≤ü§å
1/1	i got my vaccine 2 days ago (note that its a 5-11 vaccine) Idk if this is abnormal but i had no side effects. Not even my arm was sore
1	i got pfizer i get second dose in 3 weeks im happy about it
1/1	i got the moderna. didn‚Äôt really feel any crazy side effects, just super tired. the stiffness in my arm lasted about 2-3 days
1/1	i got the pfizer vaccine and i‚Äôm fully vaccinated. when i got the first one, i just felt sleepy and a little soreness in my arm. when i got the second one, i went on vacation and had a ton of fun at a water park.
1/0	i got the shot a week ago and have been having horrible anxiety because I see people say "it's gonna mess up your immune system and kill you" the only pain I've gotten this pass week is my in my chest because of anxiety. thank you for this video, it has calmed my anxiety a bit
1/1/1/1	i got the shot. i feel good!
0/0	i got the vaccine and regret it. 4 days later i feel lousy and it feels like this vaccine is literally killing me
0/0	i guess it is better to die from the disease than the vaccines!or or clots from astra zeneca!
0/-1	i guess when you take experimental vaccines only authorized for emergency use stuff happens
0/0	i had a severe vaccine injury with pandremix which was rushed out for swine flu, took me a year to recover. So am extremely worried about another vaccine
1/1	i had it a week ago no side effects
1/1	i had my doubts too, and i just saw the vaccine as less of a threat than being sick over and over and having to not work. i've read the research, it's promising.
1/1	i had the oxford astra zenaca vaccine on March 20th.i feel ok after it.why are they saying it causes blood clots.i got to have a second dose on june.And am over 60
1	i had the vaccine on Tuesday. Im fine
1/1/1/1	i had the vaccine on tuesday im fine
1/1	i had the vaccines i feel good.
0/0	i had to laugh "overwhelming fact that the vaccine is safe"
0	i had to laugh"overwhelming fact that the vaccine is safe"
0/1	i had to laugh\"overwhelming fact that the vaccine is safe\"
0/0	i have a lower chance of dying from covid than getting those blood clots
1/1	i have both my shots and im still wearing a mask until i hear we dont have to anymore. i recommend other people to do the same
1/0	i have the 2 vaccines and now im a zombie lol
1/1	i hope once the covid-19 vaccine becomes more widespread and more available to the public that everyone can get asap
1/-1	i hope there are more videos about the newer vaccines! thank you for all your awesome classes.
1/1	i hope this actually works, if i does im definitly taking it
1/1	i just got my second vaccine dose. no symptoms at all
1/1	i just got sore but it's gone now and I also got very tired, but, i feel good now. That's my experience from both the shots
1/-1	i just wanna know how long it's gonna be before covid is mild enough that i dont have to get tested and quarantine every time i'm possibly exposed. and i dont have to worry about every single event potentiallly getting cancelled due to cases rising. i'm almost afraid that even when it gets way less severe, people will still be so traumatized that they will want to isolate whenever someone has it. im just tired of it. i'm very pro vax, pro mask, taking covid seriously. but i want my life back. and i almost feel like all the work i've done so far has just delayed me getting covid, not actually helpsd get the world back to "normal"
0/0/-1	i just watched a video that said people can turn into a reptile after taking the vaccine
1/1/1/1	i know a woman who is 95 and had both MODERNA vaccines already ,she is doing fine afterwards
1/1	i know moderna costs more, but it seems like, moderna is the better one for older populations
1/1	i know several vaccinated persons, including myself. between moderna and pfizer the only side effect in any of the cases i've seen is a sore arm lasting no longer than 2 days. all this population control conspiracy crap makes no sense. if the shots are that deadly, why would all the richest and most important people get it first? why would every government in the whole world agree to cripple their economies unless there was a good reason? how would the reduced productivity and increased unemployment of lock down be good for rich people or governments? do you honestly think if the who started telling you how to eat and exercise instead of wearing a mask and washing you hands that you'd listen?
0/0	i know some people got permanent bad side effects from those half ass vaccines. what people should be promoting more is for people to quarantine because that's the only way this virus is ever going away
0	i know that getting Covid can be fatal, BUT, im not sure i want to play Russian Roulette with getting ANY vaccine
1/1	i like to be vacinted
1/1	i love when they think they know more than people who have literally studied this their whole adult life
0/0	i m more intrested in not dieing from a vaccine
1/0	i once choked on spaghetti so now i don't eat
1/1	i only got my first vaccine dose but i already feel sooo relieved.
0/0/0/0	i rather live like an animal than having that poison injected into me
0/0	i rather take my chance with corona with a 99 percent survival rate,
1/1	i remember just a few short months ago some people said if you are afraid and need to have everyone wear a mask, just stay home. Ok, now if you are unvaccinated and refuse to wear a mask just stay home
0/0	i say covid 19 vaccine my ass. what do you think DR. its my choice right not urs or not some selfish devil group agenda.
0/0	i smell war crimes and crimes against humanity, people are speaking out what happens after they get your "TRIAL" vaccine, oh you think it will work, i was just doing as i was told,
0/0	i took first dose and really regret it. reaction of my body to this stuff is obvious
1/1	i took the vaccine and guess what im still alive. these anti vax protester are pure comedy.
0/-1/0	i trust the psilocybin mushrooms i just ate more than these crooked fools ü§£
1/1/1/1	i urge everyone to receive the vaccine that is made available to you
1/1	i was actually one of the people in the moderna coronavirus vaccine trials who got this vaccine! i was so hyped when i read this! i also know i didnt get the placebo either because my test came back positive for covid antibodies. but im still taking the same precautions just in case.
0/0	i was ok for 2 years of pandemic,but catch covid from cooworker,he been fully vaccinated and had covid second time,i was the only one unvaccinated at work and about 6 ppl been positive as well.There is 15 of us all together in company.So it did spred very easy,no matter you are vaxxed or not.
0/0	i will just remain a recluse for the rest of my life rather than take this vax....nope!
0/0	i will not have any of the vaccines, this is a quote for one of the pharmaceutical companies product information sheets: Use in pregnancy ‚Äì Category B2 There are a limited amount of data from the use of COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca in pregnant women, or women who became pregnant after receiving the vaccine. The data are insufficient to inform on vaccine associated risk
0/0	i will not take the vaccine as i dont know what is in the vaccine and there for i dont want to take a risk...
0/0	i will not take the vaccine.. I trust my immune system
1/-1	i will take AZ vaccine because what is life without a risk ?
1/1	i will take it as soon as Im able to
1/1	i will trust the specialist doctors.
0/0	i will wait until the first wave of mutans to see what happens
0/0	i wish people could understand what vaccinations do to your immunity... some people will develop autoimmune issues because of these vaccines, suffer terribly, and wonder why.
1/1	i wish vaccines can be injected without pain(god help me ,i do vaccinate but the needle is painful)
0/0	i won't take the vaccine if masks are still required.
0/0	i wonder how humans survived before vaccines existed... Oh wait. Immune systems were around back then!
0/0	i wont be taking it and also not my child
1/1	i wont care if i die from the vaccine. if i can take something that will limit risk for others count me in
0/0	i wont take the vac , and wont take a guilt trip for not doing so thankyou
0/0	i work out 5 times a week i drink no sodas i don‚Äôt smoke i eat extremely healthy take vitamins and all that. but i will not get the vaccine so i not take care of my self. i don‚Äôt get flu shot either i don‚Äôt wear a mask and i have no been sick and i live in the south
1/1	i would love you not to vaccinate your kids if you do have one, so there would be less retards like you in this planet bcs they died at the young age
0/0	i would rather be tied to a tree and whipped than have the fakeccine
0/0/0/-1	i would take it but within 4-5 years until i know the side effecfs
0/0	i'll trust the government with my health when they stop selling cigarettes.
1/1	i'm 100% pro vaccination (as any sane person should be), but this is a tiny bit scary. It's possible that i might be one of those rare cases who gets blood clots from it - deep vein thrombosis runs in my family - my mum nearly died from a blood clot in her 20s, that started in her legs, but doctors managed to fix it before it got to her heart. I'll still get the shot, since it's the whole world's safety at risk, not just my own, and even with a hereditary condition the risk is still tiny, but i am a lil nervous. It's reassuring to see in the article that doctors are urging people to stay for 15 minutes after the shot

Luckily, it looks like they've collected enough data to be able to identify at-risk people, and take appropriate precautions. Overall, seems like taking it is still way less risky than not taking it!
1/1/1	i'm 16 and i just got my first covid-19 vaccine. i have full trust in this system and it being the most affective way to get out of this situation. go get vaccinated.
1/1	i'm an essential worker so i'm def getting the vaccine asap!
1/1	i'm going to get vaccinated now
0/0	i'm not an anti vaxxer, but my gut is telling me not to take this one.
0/0	i'm not getting something.. if the studies show the vaccines are effective, why is "the world" worried?
1/1	i'm on a COVID vaccine
1/1	i'm still amazed by the raging dumpster fire that is the youtube comment section. yeah, i know there's a 99.999999999% chance it's a waste of time, but i have a morbid curiosity. example, a recent video "Fauci baffled by latest COVID vaccine data" (he was baffled barely half of the vaccinated got booster shots) had everything from "why does anyone take him or the cdc seriously anymore", "liar", "he created covid in a lab in wuhan", to "pharma shill". thousands of comments spewing a regurgitation of one of those themes each thinking they're being witty or insightful. it's like a "worst of" version of humanity. i'm tempted to make an account only commenting about how great fauci is and how you can trust the science just to see how long it lasts before it's downvoted into oblivion and banned.
0/0	iam not about to experiment on my self for the government
0/0	id rather wait years and years until our bodies get used to the corona than get a vaccine
1/1	idk about yall but im gonna take it asap. what's the worst it could do? i'm already autistic, is it gonna give me DOUBLE autism?
0/0	idk gov forces me to vaccine but i dont want to because i dont trust it
0/0	idk how people got suckered into covid vacines, prolly because they had nothing else to offer, then they became a self fullfilling prophecy, a self licking ice cream cone of grift, graft, corruption, backhanders and bullshit!
0/0	idk if I would trust a vaccine from someone saying there's too many people on the earth either
1/-1	idols finally getting vaxxed yaas
0/0	if I'm expected to take the vaccines because I'm responsible for strangers' health, I suppose I also should be forcing them to exercise and take away their McDonalds, alcohol, and cigarettes as well.
1/1	if alll antivaxx parents were declared unfit, the world would be a better place..
0/0	if anything my body should have been defenceless but the whole thing is a fucking hoax and tbh I wouldn't be surprised if vaccines make you more susceptible to it
0/0	if f you can't sue the people who made the vaccine then we shouldn't get it.
1/1/1	if few population dont take vaccine then virus mutates beteen them and it would affect people who vacinated already....be responsible
0/0	if government is really concerned about your health they would have shut down McDonalds.
1/1	if i get the chance, i will take it!!!
1/-1	if i had to choose i'd take pfizer's lol
0/-1	if it makes you feel any better, the flu is more dangerous to your kids than Covid

1/-1	if johnson & johnson had a 69% efficancy rate, i woulda been the first to get it!
0/-1	if natural antibodies don't protect for long, then how would a vaccine protect you for any long length of time?
1/1	if people wont listen to doctors, people that specialize in this field. who will they listen to?
0/-1	if someone is neither 'immune to' nor 'vaccinated against' covid and are not properly and consistently wearing a good quality and sanitary face mask while completely following safety protocols, then they are consciously choosing to be a liability to others. yes, its their 'freedom of choice' their consequence of what becomes imprinted upon their soul as a result is, also theirs.
0/1	if telling me I need a vaccine shot before I'm allowed to do certain activities I've always done it sure as fuck is giving up freedom.....youre dumb as a rock
0/0	if the flu vaccine doesnt work bcz the flu mutates so much, why should the covid one work when covid mutates just as much lol
0/-1	if the genetic material gets in a cell, wont it produce more virus?
0/-1	if the media is correct and the political vaccine works... we're tired of being screwed with... the media virus ends now...
0/0	if the vaccine actually worksd - then why do workers wear masks when administering it - surely theyve been vaccinated and IF it works then a mask shouldnt be needed correct?
0	if the vaccine does not prevent infection, what is going to happen to my body?
0/1	if the vaccine protects nobody...then why are 90 percent of the people in the hospitals unvaccinated? Are you ok?
0/0	if the vaccine was so good, u wouldn‚Äôt need to promote it so much
0/0	if the vaccine was working how come people who are full vaccinated getting the virus it is suppose to work when will they stop lying to people .
0/0	if the vaccine worked, vaccinated wouldn't be worried about unvaccinated. FACT.
1/1	if the vaccine, which mimics the virus‚Äôs effect does harm, than Covid would have done the same or much worse.
1/0	if the vaccines are so safe and effective,why can't you sue the companies that make the vaccines? if adverse reactions are so rare,they should not be worried about an extremely rare lawsuit here and there right?
1/-1	if the virus had a 99.997% recovery rate and there are 300k deaths, then the USA population would have 10 billion people
0/-1	if there was at least one fatal case and there were more, no one has the right for anyone to be forced to risk his life !!!!!!

0/0	if they try to vaccinate me, I would consider that assault with a deadly weapon
0/0	if trump was in, he wouldn‚Äôt pay pfizer
1/1	if u don‚Äôt take it when u get the chance it would make the virus last longer and we won‚Äôt fight it and u can‚Äôt get back to ur normal life. It‚Äôs selfish. It‚Äôs completely safe they wouldn‚Äôt give it to us if it wasn‚Äôt. I have family members that have had it and they are completely fine.
0/0	if u feel fine why take it lol
1/1	if ur an anti-vax,then i feel sorry for u and your children,btw i'm waiting the vaccines in home,is the best that we can do know.
1/1	if ur the only who gets the vaccine, then the pandemic is not going to end soon, people are still going to die. That's why, everyone or least 50% of the world probably needs to take it to curb and possibly end the pandemic.
0/-1	if vaccines aren't profitable, nobody makes them. MONEY TALKS :) They still haven't made any vaccin against HIV virus...
1/1	if vaccines didn‚Äôt work, then why has the polio and measle rate decrease.
0/0	if vaccines work so well, why do big pharma need immunity from lawsuits?
0/0	if we are still likely to get covid while vaccinated, then what‚Äôs the point?
1/1	if we really want to get rid of Covid-19 and return society to a semblance of normal, we need to get most of the population vaccinated or infected. I‚Äôll take the vaccine over infection anytime.
1/1	if we want to end the pandemic we need to donate vaccine doses because vaccines easily helps in covid-19 chain breaking
1/-1	if were gonna fight..we fight here. No running away.

0/0	if you are that dumb to let these socialist scum put needles in you well good luck i pray for you
1/1	if you are vaccinated then you are protected even if exposed to the virus on a plane. just because a corporation doesn't care about your health doesn't make the vaccine pointless
1/1	if you are worried about mRNA technology get the Johnson&Johnson vaccine, it uses older proven vaccine technology.
0/0	if you can't sue the people who made the vaccine then we shouldn't get it.
0/0	if you claim to discover a vaccine for #COVID19, just keep it to yourself. #Africa prefers #COVID19 over your #NoVaccineForMe
1/1	if you don't have the vaccine, you're robbing someone else their right to live a healthy normal life

1/1	if you don't want yours , do let me know ..I'm quite happy to...
1/1	if you don‚Äôt get the virus or at least have a less chance to get the virus it‚Äôs not as big chance to infect others
1/1	if you get Covid the issues with it are less and you can more likely survive.
1	if you get fatigue, fever, body aches, after the second dose but not the first one, the first dose probably did significantly well to protect you from the real thing, as your body started it's defenses the second time it witnessed the virus. Glad to hear its working as it should.
1/1	if you have a learning disability and it has been over 3 months since your second coronavirus vaccine- call your GP for a booster.
1	if you haven't finished school how can you understand more than doctors

0/0	if you needa get boosters for every year then something aint working simple as that
1/1	if you refuse to get your child vaccinated you‚Äôre the ignorant one.
1/1	if you smoke ciggarets you should not worry about the covid vaccine
1/1	if you think ab any crazy virus or disease in the world, you do realize that people still get it to this day? it‚Äôs just not a majority of people anymore because we found vaccines and ways to treat it and make it more preventable than before
1/1	if you think about how the vaccine is our only chance right now in ending this pandemic and we all want our lives back, I think you can't do wrong in getting it. I understand that it can be frightening but all vaccines that are available in your country are well tested and effective
1/1	if you think the vaccine is more dangerous than the virus then you are dumb.
1/1	if you want your kids to live, vaccinate them. it's as simple as that
0/0/0	if your chances of surviving covid are around 99.7%... why tf would U get a vaccine ?... if the vaccine works .. then why tf do I still have to wear DOUBLE masks ?? Why tf do I still have to social distance ??

1/1	in the past vaccines have gave people certain reactions and even death in some cases . This is good news that these vaccines are going without a hitch .
1/1	inactivated vaccines are good options.
0/-1	incredible how far they can go with the lack of scruples and the most basic common sense. I still hope for a day of judgment, in which even those hospital directors, accomplices to this dictatorial theater, will be condemned and banned from their right to practice medicine.
1/1	individuals protecting themselves protects the herd in the long run, when enough are protected the virus has no where to go.
0/0	injury and deaths are off the scale with these experimental pointless injections and that is only in the short term
1/1	insane that people would rather have the entire virus genome inside of them than a fragment of it from the vaccine
0/0	interesting experiment for Mrna..... Edits the genetics. Next step genetic diseases.
1/1	is it bad I put no second thought into getting my vaccine? I literally heard that a local hospital had extra vaccines and were open to the general public, and signed up for my vaccine. Waited in line for two hours to get my first dose, and felt totally normal... what the hell is wrong with these people that are freaking out about it?? what the hell are they reading/hearing??
0/0	is there any liability for the vaccine makers if something goes wrong? If not, who benefits from selling us this vaccine and why?
0/0	is this even a vaccine ? MRNA ???? a vaccine has to be tested for atleast 5 to 10 yeasr before it can be administered to the masses to see the long term side effects. people are getting terminally sick and even dying from this mrna test. we humans are the Guinea pigs and we cant even take action or sue these vaccine makers for damages. yet still we are taking this experimental shittt..... we are surely brainwashed and we aren't thinking for ourselves. wake up people . we have hydroxy-chloroquin + zinc and even ivermectine which are cures yet still a vaccine agenda is being pushed. my god help us....
0/0	isn't it interesting how pro-vaccine people will take credit for millions of lives being saved by vaccines... but they will never take any responsibility for even one single death caused by vaccine?
0/0	isn‚Äôt there covid in the shot
0/0	it begs the question does it not - why do they want to decimate the military with these dangerous vaccines
1	it controlled the people// and destroyed thousands if not tens of thousands of small businesses//and told the people we are in charge// the only reason they did not take it to the extreme that australia did ,, is the 2nd amendment
0/0	it doesn‚Äôt give you immunity stop calling it a vaccine
1/1	it had one of the largest sample sizes in history. So no, it was not untested.
1/1	it helps to get back to normal life

1/1	it is better to take this vaccine
1/1	it is embarrassing how these anti-vaxxers put in danger their own child and the weakest, most in-need children who are not healthy enough to be vaccinated (herd-immunity) just for one fucking paper showing a CORRELATION, not a causation. i.e. pure speculation.
0/0	it is funny we live in a free world but we are forced to take a western medicine even if we are not sick or we don't need
1/1	it is great to finally have the vaccines ready for the people
1/1	it is hugely encouraging to see so many vaccines proving and going into development
0/0	it is not safe millions have died from it i would never have it covid is a scamdemic it is only the flue 99.9 survive it the vaccine is untested and no one knows the long term effects i have no fear of covid would fear the vaccine even if covid was a killer dying of the flue is not as bad as dying of Auto immune syndrome wich is what this vaccine will do people have been Brainwashed by mainstream media the whole thing was planned in the United nations in October 2019 cold event 201
1/1	it is safe for diabetic people. My mother diabetic and she got her first shot about 4 weeks ago. She didn't had any side effects.
1/1	it is the greatest invention of all time
1/1	it is the only way to prevent coronavirus from entering your body
1/1	it is theONLY solution and we can only hope it works..
1/1	it is. the search for a covid-19 vaccine is one of the most well-researched and most well-funded, cooperative scientific endeavours of the modern era. even though we've been so divided this year, somehow humanity still found it in us to work together to find a cure for this awful disease that has killed hundreds of thousands in the us alone
1/1	it isn't going to cause any harm getting vaccinated, so no
0/0	it poison . end of story.
0/0	it seems like the only thing the vaccine does is perpetually ruins our society on a day to day basis..
0/0	it should be tessted more
0/0	it still to early to come to certain medical conclusions about covid and vaccines so you must think twice before getting vaccinated .
0/0	it takes at most 10 days to recover from the vaccine?? You kidding me? Without vaccines it takes 10 days to recover.
1/1/1/1	it was my turn today to get inoculated against covid. got my first shot today. thank you
0/0	it will be interesting to see what the effects on these Guinea pigs will be!
0/0	it won't help us to not get it again, it will mean we will still have to wear the masks, and how come pep[;e ar gettomg bad things from it, and how come they have not had trials for it only a couple of hundred people and then it was people, not rats or guinea pigs and how come if this doesn't help us stop wearing the mask and it doesn't help us from not getting it again, how come they won't let us us Harliqoquin or other medicines that have been around for a long time that cure it if you catch it early? You people are just asking for trouble, you have to do your homework and check different things to make sure. I won't take it until I am sure what ever they have it has been tested. Also I believe we never had to do all this nonsense in the first place it just fit in perfectly for a pandemic that didn't need to be. They wanted people to listen to them and for us to be under their control so they could do what they are doing, ruining our wonderful country. The whole thing was just made up to keep us under control.
1	it works the same way. It may not be made from protein subunits or inactivated viruses. It still primes the immune system to recognize and eliminate a known pathogen while minimizing symptoms. And by minimizing symptoms, it helps protect the vaccinated from more severe symptoms and helps them cope without having to overload the hospitals. The vaccine doesn‚Äôt 100% stop transmission - that‚Äôs where the masks, social distancing, and hand washing come in play - but it does curb the SPEED of transmission and helps prevent people from becoming human laboratories for variants! And yes, protecting children and the vulnerable means surrounding them with vaccinated people and shielding them from possible spread by wearing masks, maintaining social distance and by washing hands properly. If you refuse to do these things, then do so at your own risk. But don‚Äôt come running to the already overloaded hospitals to clamor for treatment once COVID gets you. Healthcare workers shouldn‚Äôt have to bear the brunt for your decisions.
1/1	it's a good thing so many of you are pro vaccine, because by 2030, they'll likely be mandatory for everyone
1/1	it's a new kind of vaccine but it should be fine
0/0	it's a vaccine that doesn't stop infection nor transmission- awesome!
1/1	it's amazing how quickly a vaccine was created for this pandemic with a high effective rate to boot. Modern science is amazing. The power of science.
1/1	it's been 3 weeks getting second dose tomorrow. Please...do your part!!
0/0	it's been proven not to work and be harmful to healthy people but let's force them to take the vaccine
0/1/1	it's criminal that this vaccine is not being widely rolled out in europe, but saying that the AZ vaccine has already saved millions of lives is a little bit hyperbolic..
0/0	it's designed to change our DNA unlike the common (safe) vaccines, they introduce a piece of the dead virus to help out body detect the virus
1/1	it's important for them to know they are still extremely well protected if they got Pfizer.
1/1	it's interesting how the educated ones are the people who support the vaccine
1/1	it's just the mRNA of the virus and that is an established practice already so it can be assumed to be decently safe
1/1	it's not like they have just started working on the vaccine from step 1, it has been studided before
0/0	it's not the anti-vaxx/anti-madate individuals who are radical, it's the people trying to force people to take a poorly tested vaccine who are radical.
1/1	it's sad that ppl actually think that vaccines r harmful
0/0	it's safe and fully tested...right? oh hell NO! the covid vaccines are EXPERIMENTAL! remember that!
1/1	it's still safer to get vaccinated than to get covid
1/1	it's to prevent hospitalization and death, which all vaccines did at 100% efficiency.
1/1	it's your choice but it's definitely not poison. I'll agree not enough time has passed but vaccines are a crucial part of our life expectancy today and why our children are not paralyzed for life.
0/-1	its a complot of the chinese government to gain world dominance
0/0	its a lie COVID 19 VACCINATION IS THE MARK OF THE BEAST 666 THE TIME HAS COME !
0/0	its a persons right to refuse something they dont want in their body
0/0	its bad when they have to CONVINCE you that it is safe to take and you should do it
0/0	its dangerous. im an indian from europe and we got lot of problems here with the vaccine. hope not a lot of my fellow brothers and sisters will take this shot. please be careful.
0/0	its fake news!! Covid and vaccise is hoax
1/1	its free safe and you protect urself ur family and other people
1/1	its funny how sceintis want to help people and yet people resist!
1/1	its good that people are encouraging other people to take the vaccination :))
1/0	its killing people even just 1 person dieing is unacceptable these is a global pandemic not the common cold. By not takeing that vaccine your putting everyone at risk not just yourself.
0/0	its makes your immune system weaker that‚Äôs the price you pay take vitamin A, D, C that‚Äôs all you need
0/0/0	its never been a "vaccine", it's genetic engineering.
0/0	its not safe, obviously lol, Don‚Äôt get it it may well be the mark of the beast
0	its now been proven that the vaccine does more harm statistically to under 30's than a covid infection
1/1	its over 90 % safe just take it already!!
1/1	its really hard to be sympathetic toward these people. covid never had to be this bad but people refused to wear masks and listen to experts and now they're paying for it.
0/0	its reasonable to know that over 99 percent of people recover from covid.the vaccinations can't compete with those percentages.these shill doctor's need to go back and study mathematics.scientist information are a bunch of tested theories that are ever-changing.nothing in this life is guaranteed,but at least let us choose for ourselves what is best.the government is a beast entity that only cares about itself.
1/1	its sad to see how hard the scientists are working on the vaccine and how negative people are
1/-1	its smart vs dum
0/0	its survival of the fittest, gtfo vaccines making men weak
1/1	its time to start killing antivaxxers and using them as compost. Things like them dont deserve to live.
0/-1	its unethical to force people to have a vaccine against their will,as it is to force anyone to do anything against their will
0/0	it‚Äôs already been proven and masks don‚Äôt work lockdowns don‚Äôt work vaccines don‚Äôt work. Why do you continue to be a dead horse? Whoops‚Ä¶maybe the horse died of COVID??
1/1/1	it‚Äôs not all about you. If you contract COVID-19 and you are in contact with someone who has a weakened immune system then spread it to them. That means you are responsible for their severe illness/death since you had the power to protect yourself and in turn them. Just because someone has asthma does that mean they deserve to die?
1/1	it‚Äôs not just about you though. The first vaccine is to make your body ready for the booster which is a larger dose. The booster won‚Äôt have any effect In you because of the original. The side effects aren‚Äôt actually side effects. They are just your immune system building resistance against the virus.
1/1	it‚Äôs not vaccines that will stop the pandemic, it‚Äôs vaccination
0/0	it‚Äôs proven‚Ä¶ many r sick with it and have had 2, 3, and some countries may even be on 4th and still believing that these jabs work‚Ä¶
1/1	it‚Äôs understandable to be worried about it, i think lot‚Äôs of people are iffy about it who normally wouldn‚Äôt be just because of the sheer speed of it. But I really think it might help alleviate your worries if you read about the how‚Äôs and why‚Äôs of the speed of this vaccine. ‚ò∫Ô∏è and you‚Äôll see that they had quite the headstart anyway, they just needed the investment of the government to ramp up production, etc. The other thing that has helped, is the coverage of this virus, because it has resulted in a LOT of people taking part in the vaccine safety trials where they normally don‚Äôt have such numbers. I hope that helps a little! ü•∞
1/1	ive been wanting a vaccine but cant get one cuz of priority queue
0/0	ive it time we will all have side effects. My health has done nothing but go down hill since I've been vaccinated.
1/1	i‚Äôm 18 and i can‚Äôt walk up the stairs without becoming out of breath. i was healthy and working out 4-5 times a week before i got covid. please get the vaccine if you are able
1/1	i‚Äôm getting my first dose tonight!!!
0	i‚Äôm gonna wait to get the vaccine to see if y‚Äôall die from it first
0/0/0	i‚Äôm not scared about an allergic reaction i‚Äôm scared about the long term effects because we don‚Äôt know what they are
0/0/0/0	i‚Äôm not taking anything that changes my DNA smd
1/1	i‚Äôm pro vaccine all the way but if the conspiracy theorists are right and it turns out to kill us out or something, i‚Äôll be glad to be gone because then the only things left on this planet are those insufferable cunts
1/1	i‚Äôm pro vaccine, i‚Äôm pro (single) mask, and i still follow the guidelines/laws in the state i live in i dont go to ppls houses or to parties smh
1/1	i‚Äôs weird, vaccines have done their job so well that there are people who are likely alive from them denouncing them
1/1	jesus sent you the vaccine to save you
0/-1	just as you don‚Äôt know the long term effects do you? If you do please tell everybody, and show them the studies, tell us exactly what all the possible side effects are, and guarantee that it is totally safe and effective. From what I‚Äôm seeing so far it isn‚Äôt, is it? People are still contracting COVID apparently in similar numbers whether they had the vax or not, as you don‚Äôt know this information, because it‚Äôs impossible to yet know, what gives you the right to bully others who would choose to excersize caution, into going along with your opinion of the situation?
1/1	just at a much lower ration than unvaccinated people and with much milder symptoms. A vaccinated person is in average 80% less likely to get infected by Covid-19, around 95% less likely to develop serious symptoms, and 97+ (depends on age) less likely to die with Covid.
1/1	just got my booster! the expansion of the vaccine has been great to see!
1/1/1/1	just got my covid vaccine- astounded at the process, grateful for this moment.
1/1	just got my first shot and I‚Äôm feeling great! Thank you Ted for sharing this important message and I wish everyone a great day, except for the anti vax people commenting here. Stay safe!
1/1	just got my first shot. trust in the science.
1/1	just got my first vaccine today. No side effects so far. Thank you to all the scientists and researchers around the world for making the vaccine available this early and thank you for this channel for spreading the science. Yes, it‚Äôs definitely OK to be smart. Science rules!!!!
1/1/1/1/1/1	just got my second dose yesterday! God bless everyone, stay safe

0/0	just wait to get covid19 if you are in good health. seriously. the vaccine is for people with bad health, are old, or haven't had covid 19.
1/1	karen it isnt the vaccine's fault your kid is autistic, have you considered getting yourself checked?
1/0	karens: im not vacinating my kids ever everyone:didnt you drop out of second grade good for you now your kids will die if you tried
1/1/1	keep the good work UK. well done! My second Pfizer will happen the next thursday (4 days and counting). I am in NYC and I literally can't wait :)
0/0	keep them for your self
0/0	keep your placebo vaccine. jam it in your own arms
1/1	kid: mom i cant wait to grow up! anti vaxx mom: oh i don't think so kid
1/1	know I‚Äôm late on this, but Jesus Christ! A lot of fucking people are actually not going to take the vaccine. WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE!?!?
0/0	know MANY vaccinated people who have had covid.
1/1	l take the vacine and there is no pain no side effects ..is just fine...l go for the second in 25 days ...
1/-1	l went 4 my final dose today and l m fine even the first dosei which l took on 11 Nov 2022
1/1	lady: it killed my aunt, my uncle, my friends bUt iM nOt aFrAiD oF iT
0/0	last time they released one of these it took years and years to get licensed and approved but they jus hit us with this in a year.
1/1	laughs in vaccinated British accent
0/0	legendary vaccine, doesnt even prevent you from getting covid again lol goated
0/0	let me see, those that have been fully vaccinated are still getting COVID. those that have gotten the booster are still getting COVID. I guess we are not getting vaccinated because we know that the vaccines do nothing to protect people from COVID and that COVID is so deadly that only 99.9997% will survive. that is all posted on the CDC website.
0/1	let them get vaccinated. it is not your body. I understand the vaccine concerns but no-one decides for another person. I am anti vaccine btw
1/1	let's go vaccines!
1/1	let's hope that these vaccines become available sooner than later. We really need to get this viral epidemic under control as quickly as possible‚Ä¶
0/0	let's see what a couple of months/years to see the real effects,good luck
1/1	let`s take this vaccine and see what happens.
1/1	lets hope they will work and we can all continue our lives!!
1/-1	lets just vaccinate the ones with compromised immune system
1/1	letting the virus spread is the better idea? take the damn vaccine
0/0	liars, people are waking up
0/0/0	liberals - "it's my body , don't tell me what to do", liberals over vaccine -" everyone needs to be forced to take the vaccine".
0/0	lies. Look into how many vaxxed people are still spreading covid and doing so without symptoms. Also, look how many are still catching covid with the wonderful vaccine
1/1	life taker? third one? You mean the booster shot? Oh yeah, I‚Äôm not supposed to get that yet. My country‚Äôs letting those over 18 to get the booster shot first. But my parents have taken the booster and both of them are fine so I suppose I don‚Äôt have to worry.
1/-1	like living in a democratic country that allows freedom. But what is a big problem for me is that above the culture of freedom the responsibility for the consequences of this freedom has been lost.
1/1	like the humor but 66% is still generally effective once applied to the population, I think fear of vaccine rn is more than ever and stuff like this makes it harder to convince those who just see the headline and assume to actually get it. if anything any vaccine even 25% is useful or less because it removes a portion of the population from getting covid. you remove 25% of the US pop its 82m people immune :). understand most people know that it isnt an issue, but given recent events and the last few years, stats dont really mean much to most, they see a low number and use it as a weapon against whatever agenda. we should be heralding the effectiveness of any vaccine given the short period, especially one that can be transported to rural areas easier where the population more likely to be sceptical of it lives.
1/1	listen I don't know about all this american spiritual trippy stuff, but what I know is that if not enough people take the vaccine, then people will die. Alot of people will die. And for what? This is what happens when people forget history, forget diseases like polio and what it does to people. "But the vaccine might give side effects" yes? How many can be saved with it? Hundreds? Thousands? Hundreds of thousands? People need to care about others than themselves.
0/0	literally everyone i know who is sick with covid right now has had 2 or more jabs. i literally know nobody who is sick who is unvaccinated.
1/1	literally no poison or anything harmful in a vaccine. Russian roulette is what you play with covid, not the vaccine.
1/1	little scared but will still get the vaccine for the greater good save the old ones
0	load bs all to depopulate the human race,they are gene therapys if you have had the test up the nose you have already have the nanos in you
0/0	lol Fully vaccinated people are still dying and spreading the virus. Still bad side effects from the vaccine as well. Being unvaccinated does not mean infected. Vaccinated does not mean its saving lives, this is not about life saving, it's about tyranny, control, manipulation
1/1	lol planning on getting the vaccine
0/0	lol still dont plan on taking the vaccine.
0/0	lol that would convince me more to not get vaccinated
1/1	lol what are you on about. Literally everyone around me has had the vaccine and there haven‚Äôt been any side effects apart from the illness it can cause when initially getting the jab. Maybe people would see the reality that most have taken it and most are fine if they actually went outside for once
1/1	lol whatever. If they were serious long term side effects that were common, we would absolutely know by now considering the amount of people who have the vaccine. Plus, to me, keeping my loved ones safe who I know are high risk outweighs the risks of side effects that might not ever show up.
0/0	lol yeah lets change the DNA of all Humans, that can't possibly go wrong XD
0/0	lol you think this poison protects you?
0/0	lol, "its safe" no worries
0	lol. They tell you their evil ways. I am glad that some actually pay attention. There is no 'covid'. It is just a normal flu season. But by using different words they carry out their evil plans. And they are tormenting and attacking all of us because that is what evil people do. Evil people love the power of government.
1/1	lolwhut? why are you suggesting people will get covid19 from the vaccine? the vaccine doesn't cause the disease. not only that, but trials so far have shown 94% of those vaccinated are immune to the disease, and 0% of those vaccinated get severe symptoms if they are one of the 6% who aren't immune. do you understand?
1/1	long term effects haha. Any serious vaccine side effects show up in the first two or three weeks after vaccination. The blood clotting, if it is a result of the vaccine, this is not yet determined, the cases could be a statistical fluke. Even if it is an adverse reaction to the vaccine the numbers are virtually insignificant, to the extent that we wouldn't be able to observe them in a clinical trial. Such extremely rare events are only ever discovered in our after market monitoring of the product. The after market monitoring also highlights when changing the dosing schedule would be beneficial. This was seen with the
1/-1	look at all the trolls disliking because they can't accept reality lol
0/0	looks like i will not be traveling if you need a vaccine to travel. TYRANY
0/0	lots of people died after contracting vaccine
1/1	love how everyone suddenly comes a professional in work that people have taken years to train for ü•¥ simple if you don't want the vaccine dont have it but also don't put others off from having it iv had mine am still here living and breathing and no side effects what so ever üëå
1/1	luckily I got the shot! Pls dont underestimate the importance of the vaccines
1/1	m an Icu nurse and we still have alot of patients like Christopher. It seems like they are getting younger now and they end up dying. When did vaccine get to be a dirty word? I have seen a few people who were vaccinated end up on a ventilator but most are the unvaccinated. I think a life is more important than arguing about the vaccine. I have seen rare adverse reactions to the flu shot, like guillane barret,but nothing from the covid vaccine, that I am aware of anyway.
1/1	m currently getting over covid and since i got the vaccine my covid is just like a cold, even my docter said it seemed like a cold, although it is scary to have covid, if you get the vaccine its not as bad, if you are not vaccinated, GET VACCINATED! its amazing how science has come so far. GET VACCINATED AS SOON AS YOU CAN!!! stay safe everyone and wear a mask
1/1	m guessing you aint currently age or health prone and don‚Äôt believe in Covids cos you never seen one leering menacingly through your window. Culture enough and you are sure to get a convincing little blighter a real beano no amount of vaccine tweaking will fix. All for the sake of one quick shot. It won‚Äôt hurt you! Not painful ! Honestly!
1/1	mRNA COVID vaccines are safe and effective. mRNA vaccines don't affect your personal genes or DNA. They do not contain a live virus. They cannot give you COVID
0/0	mRNA VACCINES ARE MORE DANGEROUS THAN CORONAVIRUS COVID-19
0/0	mRNA and DNA-based vaccines' side-effects in the short (6 months - 1 year), medium (2 to 3 years) and long (5+ years) term ARE COMPLETELY UNKNOWN TO SCIENCE. Thus those who consciously and voluntarily agreed to participate in such clinical trials and got those vaccines in their system have become lab rats indeed.
1/1	mRNA can't mutate because it's just messenger RNA. The reason why we have mutations is due to mistakes in the DNA duplication process when cells divide. Which is unrelated to the mRNA vaccine.
1/1	mRNA does not alter your genetics and this method of developing vaccines has been studied for over a decade now.
1/1	mRNA does not change your genes.
0/0	mRNA gene therapy taches our bodies to attack the 'protein S' which is already in our bodies, and is vital in the process of the reproduction. Wasn't it BG who wanted to fight overpopulation?
1/-1	mRNA is located outside the nucleus of your cells (in the cytoplasm where it will be translated into protein), so no, it will not alter your DNA or üß¨ code.
1/1	mRNA is precursor of protein. It‚Äôs as safe as protein or even safer. I would take it
1/0	mRNA not a trusted vaccine, be cautious whoever taking.. I will take adenovirus vaccine, which we can trust. Adenovirus vaccines are very successful.
0/-1	mRNA sounds like cancer to me.
0/0	mRNA technology has not been adequately or unequivacably proven. I do not want a chemical messing with my immune system.
0/0	mRNA technology has not been adequately or unequivacably proven. I do not want a chemical messing with my immune system. I'll boost my system naturally thank you
0/0	mRNA treatements have only ever been used on last case worst case senarios! wake up. the studies in 2004 showed that the SARS vaccines killed 100% of the test subjects after the vaccinated were exposed to the wild virus strain. This go around YOU are the TEST SUBJECT.
1/1	mRNA vaccine has been developed 3 decades ago and has been used clinically for 6 years.
1/1	mRNA vaccine seems less likely to cause issues. It‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt involve any live virus. Does not involve going into the nucleus itself at all. There is just less steps in the process in general.
0/-1	mRNA vaccine, people should know what was going in their body
0/1	mRNA vaccines actually induce an illness instead of an immuno-transmissive response. In other words, nothing about this is going to stop you transmitting anything. This is about getting you sick, and having your own cells be the thing that get you sick.
0/1	mRNA vaccines are certainly looking pretty good at the moment
0/0	mRNA vaccines are dangerous according to most Doctors. You did also not test them for long term damages so I say no thank you to the vaccine.
1/1	mRNA vaccines are like putting a CD in your computer but not copying it to the hard drive
1/1/1/1/1/1/1	mRNA vaccines are such a genius method, I love it
0/0	mRNA vaccines are toxic, thats why they have to split it up in 2 doses
1/1	mRNA vaccines don't alter your DNA, they teach it to make a protein to combat the virus. Learn the truth by trusted sources like CDC, FDA, ACIP, WHO, as well as the makers of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, Moderna vaccine, and J&J Janssen vaccine
1/1	mRNA vaccines has been studied and they are secure
0/0	mRNA vaccines have NEVER used before on such a wide scale. that is no conspiracy. and i will not be a test subject of big pharma. and who knows what genetic modifications this vaccine will do to my still unborn children? i do not know. i will wait for traditional Oxford or Russian Sputnik to be available. to take the new mRNA vaccine i would have to trust big pharma or EU regulators. which i don't.
1/1	mRNA vaccines have been researched for over 20 years, the vaccines have been fully tested.
1/-1	mRNA vaccines have been studied before for flu, Zika, rabies, and cytomegalovirus (CMV). As soon as the necessary information about the virus that causes COVID-19 was available, scientists began designing the mRNA instructions for cells to build the unique spike protein into an mRNA vaccine

0/0	maybe not wanting to get the vaccine stems way back from when I was in high school, a big epidemic was the Asiatic flu. We had to get flu shots, and we all got sick.
0/0	maybe vaccines reduce fertility?
0/0	maybe you should call this 'EXPERIMENTAL vaccine hesitancy.' Because these are global......EXPERIMENTS?' Hahaha. Do you guys go over documented mRNA vaccine reactions? Peer reviewed and all that? That'd be great....thanks.

1/1	my asthmatic lungs and anxious heart will be able to sleep a little more soundly thanks to the incredible work of our doctors and scientists with the covid vaccine.
1/1	my auntie actually got the vaccine too. She‚Äôs doing swell. So did my grandma. She‚Äôs 67 years strong. If they can take it. So can you
1/0	my body, my rules, and I choose to be healthy and not mentally shunted due to baseless propoganda
1/1/1/1	my city is opening vaccinations for everyone at the beginning of april. already have my appointment, i‚Äôm so ready
0/0	my cousin and uncle are both vaccinated, 2 times, yet they still caught covid 2-3 months after they took the 2nd shot to me, the vaccine seems useless unless you have other health issues. if you're healthy you got nothing to worry about based on the stats, surviving chance is 98.1%
1/1	my dad mom and brother along with me got the pfizer vaccine. We're all fine. My dad and mom had burning ears and a scratchy throat in the first day of being vaccinated, after that first day they felt perfect after. Me and my brother had no symptoms after vaccination and we all tested positive for antibodies against coronavirus as of yesterday. You're an anti-vax fool. Science doesn't lie so trust in science.
1/1	my dad, an metastatic cancer patient, just told me he might have had COVID but isn‚Äôt sure because he couldn‚Äôt afford a $50 rapid test or find a PCR. i‚Äôm so fucking mad for so many reasons, but first and foremost bc people like my dad matter. mask up. get vaccinated. fuck.
0/0	my dads friend just received the jab and he said he's never felt sicker, wished he had listened to us now.
0/0	my daughter spent the night in the ER last Monday. I have photos of her clots which were 3-4 inches long. This was her first cycle following her first dose of Pfizer. She's never had problems before. The one nurse who looked at the photos (which hospital staff asked her to take so they could see what she was complaining about) said that her sister had the same type of clots following the vax. However, staff would not list these huge, abnormal clots as a side effect of the vax. The clots came every 20-30 minutes. Very scary & unusual. Needless to say, she will not be getting the 2nd dose
1/1	my explaination to the anti-vaxxers: well, the reason your kid ain't dead yet is because of herd immunity

0/0	my husband is a doctor, brother and sister in law are nurses and all have refused a vaccine and have worked directly with covid and say the vaccine is way too early to take.
1/1	my mom didn't vaccinate me. I need help convincing her cause I don't feel safe.
1/-1	my mom got astra seneca, she had heavy symptoms like being tired and headache , on top of that she got nose bleed ... she gets another vaccine now for her sencond shot . :c it was a terrible experience :c

1/1	my neighbor took it and says she feel great
0/0	my nephew got vaccinated his immune system packed up and he had to have a bone marrow transplant
0/0	my personal opinion is look at all the guinea pig experiments they (govt)have done on even their own military..hitler tried to make a super army..china,us,iran,russia all doing it now..(nimrod) GOD is going to melt the elements of this world again..new heaven new earth...
0/0	my sister in law is a nurse. she received the phizer vaccine. about 5 weeks later she was tested positive for the virus. her symptoms were minor, she is 40 but still she got the virus after receiving the vaccine!
1/1	my son is autistic its not caused by vaccines but at a genetic level please vaccinate your children and my son is a polite and intelligent young man in college now
0/1	my son took a flu-shot once and now hes addicted to anime, never again
1/0	my teacher just taught me pseudoscience vs imperical evidence. I now see how this works in the real world
1/-1	my teacher once was explaining to us that vaccines are safe. she said that her friend was anti vaxxer and didn't want to vaccinate her child. one day her child had a very extreme fever and and because of that his legs got paralysed and now they are undeveloped. the fever was caused by a bacteria or a virus that vaccines could protect him from. if he was vaccinated maybe he would have a normal life now‚Ä¶
1/1	my vaccination card is on my fridge next to my dog‚Äôs puppy school diploma because both are great accomplishments
1/1	my whole family got it and i didn‚Äôt. i go to in person school and work almost everyday. so glad i got vaccinated lol
1/1	my whole family has covid right now luckily most of us are vaccinated and my mom and grandma are also boosted
1/1	my whole family took the vaccine and nothing happened to them apart from feeling fatigue for first day which is normal. We all want this COVID gone. so plz, just take the vaccine!
1	my wife and I both work in healthcare. Unvaccinated are 5x more likely to transmit and catch covid. At my hospital we have 80 covid patients fighting for their lives. 95% of these patients are unvaccinated.
1/1	my wife and i had our second jab at melton mowbray very pleased with the way it was organised . friendly quick and efficient .
1/1	my younger sister had a kidney reaction to a baby vaccine, and as a result, she had to be hospitalized for a few weeks, and she will not be able to get that specific vaccine again, and others that may have the same outcome. however, my family and I are still on vaccines. if my sister cannot get this vaccine, she is at risk of having this disease, and to avoid this it is necessary that the people who have contact with her have the vaccine. Get vaccinated to protect yourself, and those who for health reasons cannot be vaccinated.
1/1	myocarditis and pericarditis are also symptoms of COVID. This is why it can arise with the vaccine, but with a major difference. With vaccine = 1-2 days of mild symptoms while NO vaccine = 9-12 days with long-term cardiac damage.
1/1	myself and loved ones will also get the vaccine!
0/1	n my opinion that shows improvement of medicine of nowadays. This vaccines are not that good but Chinese and other scientists are trying to make something good for people and that's really making me think,that someone is carrying about my health and making my life better

0/0	never trust politicians
0/0	never. i will stick with raw garlic. you all can donate my dose
0/0	new broadcaster again doesnt ask the question - what are the long term health implications fwetr having it ..........Not one has asked that question (always a live or die dichotomoy) lazy, and not nuanced
1/1	nice ,I cant wait to get vaccinated.
0/0	no
0/0/0/0	no because Norwegian officials said 23 people had died in the country a short time after receiving their first dose of the vaccine.
0/0	no body should take this vacine
1/1	no but your body will fight it faster and more efficiently if you get it. Also the Pfizer vaccine of FDA approved
0/0	no clue of what the side effects
0/0	no healthy people at all need the vaccine
0/0	no i Am antivax so again. speak for urself
0/0/0	no i don't trust pfizer nor any of the other manufacturers
1/-1	no isolation

0/0	no mask, no vaccine, no problem
0/0	no need of vaccines
0/0	no need vaccines or bosster shots, God already gives us super natural powetful immunity. why need vaxx, prayed to God
1/1	no one is accepting it‚Äôs endemic except Denmark who has a much higher vaccinated population than other parts of the world.
1/-1	no one is forcing it on anyone lol. I am going to take the vaccine, if you don't want to then don't.
1/1	no one is forcing me, now or ever. I didn‚Äôt take the vaccine because I was told too. I took the vaccine because, my granddaughter had to be taken out of school when covid started, she has health issues, I home school her. My son in law her father, has stage 4 lung cancer, 6 people at my church died, we also lost a family member to covid. I want to get rid of covid, just like we got rid of mumps, rubella, polio, and all the other virus, science came up with vaccines, just like they did for covid. Covid will stay, replicate, mutate, till we all get vaccinated. I am not suicidal and I am not a murderer, people who choose to run everywhere without any thought of who‚Äôs life they maybe taking is very irresponsible. With freedom comes responsibility for our communities, our families, our friends, and yes even those who are enemies.

0/-1	no vaccine is 100% effective at stopping a virus
0/1	no way I will not get it
0/0	no way in hell would I take any of those vaccines... I'll take my 99% chance of survival with the covid. Those odds are good to me.
0/-1	no your liars no research was done, now you all doing your research using the masses as guinea pigs, yes the plandemic
0/0	no, I don't take vaccines because I believe natural is best.
1/1	no, it's not being forced in a sneaky way. You have no "human right" to come into my home or business if you're unvaccinated, and I don't want unvaccinated people there. Where do you get your ridiculous ideas about human rights? I'm sure it's not something you've given deep philosophical thought, but rather, claptrap you've picked up from an echo chamber. You're not vaccinated? I have a human right to keep you away from me on my property, and even, in public facilities. You don't want to wear pants? Same thing. You DO NOT have a "human right" to infect me. Where did you get the outsized sense of privilege you have?
1/1	no,vaccines boost your immune system.
1/1	no. Im not from america and i've always known covid vaccines were about keeping you at light symptomps if you get it.
0	no. in fact we arent far off not needing any shots, at all. pandemics do not go on forever, in business cycles. despite appearances to the contrary.
0/0	no. it can not. with the rate this is mutating, there is no way a vaccine is going to do anything. there are really only two ways to get a handle on this. Complete shut down, or go back to NORMAL and let it run its course. If everyone gets it, and beats strain a, it wont have as much of a chance to mutate before it can be destroyed by our immune systems. Deaths to date are STILL within normal yearly flu deaths. So choose. Hide from the bogyman that sees you in the corner, or pull up your big person pants and get too work. '
0/1	nobody said the vaccine is a cure
1/1	nobody wants this stupid bullshit just give us the vaccine
0	nobody will take the vaccine unless their stupidity reaches above the human limits
0/0	nobody with a brain cell in there head is going take that vaccine
0/0	none of them prevent transmission so quite a dangerous path to go down
1/0	nope not for me sorry not sorry like the saying goes my body my choice ill take my 98 percent chance or whatever it is at surviving it let my body build its own immunity you should not feel forced into doing this
0/0	nope,i promise you God and wellness are Better.I‚Äôve been doing qi gong for a long time and ancient chi arts for self healing and just mainly health and well being.Have never had a better medicine than my own , you must see the truth in faith and spirituality if you want health
0/0	not a fuckin chance I will ever vaccinate my kids for this shit
1/1	not a huge fan of Biden either, but fortunately he won‚Äôt support a vaccine mandate. Medical freedom still exists and if you don‚Äôt want to get the vaccine, then don‚Äôt, but scientific evidence is still going to be there to support why you should consider getting it.
0/0	not a single person I know trust the vaccine or are willing to take it.
0/1	not every vaccine had side effects.. at least China's does not have according to them.... CHINA NO.1!!!!
0/0	not everyone wants the vaccine
0/0	not getting it because it's rushed
0/0	not getting it!! I had Covid I survived it...my rheumatologist suggested I still get the injection I‚Äôm not getting it
0/0	not gonna put unnatural chemicals in my body for a 99.99% survival rate of my age range.

0/0	not taking any more vaccines....I no longer trust the manufacturers.
0/0	not taking it
0/0	not taking it. Also their passport is so bs
0/0	not the way it was tested, dangerous
0/0	not worth it, in addition to not IMMUNIZING THE ORGANISM, it has these risks.
0/0	note to others: DO NOT take the "booster" or any other "vaccine".
0/0/0	nothing is safe from you or gates.
1/1	notice how the pro vax people are just so much more sophisticated
0/0	now EVIL bill gates pushing for the third dose.... i think once u take the vaccine ur body will depend on it so u will hv to take all the comin doses... ur immunity will drop down.... good luck to deal later with auto immune diseases !!! WAKE UP PPL ... EAT HEALTHY! u survive ...
1/1	now i have seen it all. elderly patient had to move in with son b/c daughter told her she would end the relationship if she got the covid vaccine. She is now admitted with COVID pneumonia. Unvaccinated.
1/1	now she completed her booster already.. I am proud mama..
0/0	now way to know if this shit is safe, not taking it
1/-1	nstead if creating an air of suspicion against any kind of vaccine and it's side effects, the health authorities should clearly outline what side effects to which age band, etc. Repercussions of not taking the vaccine far outweigh the side effects, if any.
0/0	nterview mothers who have had normal, healthy children who suddenly regress or cannot stop screaming in pain after they were vaccinated. I know a child damaged by vaccines. She could walk and talk but after a doctors visit she lost all her abilities to walk and speak. Find out how many families the government has compensated for the damage done by vaccines. If they weren‚Äôt harming people then why would they be compensated?
1/1	nurses being antivax is a dereliction of their responsibility to look out for the well-being of the people they are taking care of and we are in a global health crisis, that is not my opinion; this is real whether people want it to be or not. This virus is an incredibly contagious respiratory disease and nurses, of all people, should be socially responsible enough to do their job correctly. If I found out some idiot nurse gave a family member Covid I would come unglued. You'd think that, especially watching all of this carnage happening right before their eyes 40+ hours a week, they would take it more seriously.
0/0	o not take the poison Covid-19 Vaccine. Do not agree to Vaccine Passports nor voluntarily give out your Private Medical Information, as to whether you do or do not have a vaccine. Fight Mainstream Media (ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, Fox News, etc.), fight the Satanic New Normal, fight the CDC (Big Pharma, Bill Gates), fight the WHO(Communist Chinese Party), fight Big Tech (Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, Apple, etc.), fight Hollywood, fight the New World Order, fight The Great Reset, fight the Freemasons, fight the Illuminati, fight the Antichrist. Stand for Christ.
0/0	o the study said that in the trials there have been no side effects? How long were the trials? --A Week!?
1/1	oday I got the best news! My Dad is booked in for his #COVID19 vaccine this month. He's 67 yrs old with COPD and continues to work his butt off as a mechanic. I'm so happy
0/0	of cause they say it‚Äôs safe it‚Äôs all about the MONEY they have no responsibility for what they inject you with its 100% profit
1/1	of course ... we should take the vaccine and feel safe! who refuse to take it is our enemy. god bless bill gates, he is a really nice man
0/0	of course they dont want your killshot
0	of course they say it is "safe". there are billions of dollars to profit from it, even though kids are like at no risk from the virus
1/1	of course vaccines are not fake but people are stupid enough to not get a vaccine to save them so I say let them not get tetanus shot so they get lock jaw
1/1	of course you can catch it and spread it, no one ever said you couldn't. It's not a shield! Understand how a vaccine works; it gives your immune system (Tcells) the blueprints to the virus so it can fight it off right away. It's not perfect, no vaccine is, no pharmaceutical is, but it does greatly reduce the risk of transmission and the risk of being hospitalized or even dying. Those are facts, not opinion!
1/1	of course!
1/0/1	of friggin course your sources are from 4chan, anti-vaxxers don‚Äôt have ANY credible sources
1/1	ofc i'm taking it!
1/1	often a single dose is enough to stimulate long-term protection
1/1	oh god the anti-vaxxers in the comments
1/1	oh my god just put the antivaxxers into a room with a covid patient for a day and let them out to do whatever they want smh
0/1	oh no, vaccines are uncomfortable
0/0	ohhhh arent you special? getting poison injected into you but i guess it will weed out the stupid people
1/-1	ok so my question is this. So they arent actually using covid19 in the vaccines?
1/1	okay, this sounds safe
0/-1	om- i can‚Äôt sleep ON MY FAVOURITE SIDE. vaccines are so mean
1/1	omg although I missed the early squad. I have been receiving so many requests from friends and family regarding the safety of covid vaccines. This video eases my burden of explaining and addresses all the doubts one might have.
0/-1	omicron is affecting mainly the vaccinated actually. So still be careful
0/0	once you get the poison, you can never go back.
0/0	one friend of mine died from covid even tho he was vaccinated with the 2 doses :(
0/0	one mouse to the other "Hey, did you get your vaccination?" the other mouse " No way! They are not done with the human trials yet"
0/0/0	one vaccine covid vaccine has been band in 4 countries for causing blood clots so I would not doubt there are other issues with them
0/0	one way to get rid of the poor people! astrazeneca comes to mind? look what B Gates did to the poor in India, another of his resets.
1/1	one would be lucky to even get an appt for the vaccine let alone having a choice in which one...
1/1	only 4 out of 130 000 people have got severe side allergies, all have recovered patients who show severe side effect symptoms were immediately attended to the vaccine is proven to be beneficial.

1/1	only vaccinate those children you plan to keep
1/1	only way to get rid of this shit is to take vaccine
0/0	opting out, with a 99.98 survival rate if I get it, why would I put this experimental vaccine in by body.
1/-1	or safety, they already know what adverse events to look out for; inflammatory reactions, or antibody-dependent enhancement...those are real risks, but they are captured in the real world clinical trials.
1	organizer Matt Tune, an unvaccinated 48-year-old from Chicago. He said he wants the event ‚Äúto help change the current narrative ‚Ä¶ which is basically saying that we‚Äôre a bunch of weirdos and freaks who don‚Äôt care about humanity. And that‚Äôs not true at all.‚Äù No, weirdos and freaks sounds exactly right.
0/0	other times cleaning personnel are completely ignored.And when it's about vaccination they are priority? How can people not know they are completely using people as test subject? If the vaccine was properly researched and safe all these politicians would have recieved vaccination before any one else.
1/-1	our government still says it is safe!!
1/1	our life might depend on it one day. No jab no job no foreign holidays etc is the way forward. None vaccine takers are relying on other people taking it to get our lives back to normal. Selfish especially when there's fk all wrong with the vaccines. If people did more research? they have been in the pipeline for years they simply add the virus code.
1/1	our whole household will be fully vaccinated.
1/-1	over the counter birth control has a higher chance of causing blood clots yet we aren't panicking it, why is that, Josh?
0/1/1	oxford/astrazeneca is your only option if you want a vaccine. And i wouldn't get it yet personally.
1/1	part of the reason to get vaccinated is to reduce the number of people getting ill enough to go to the hospital. Because many hospitals are at capacity from COVID patients. If all the resources are being used on COVID patients, then they don‚Äôt have those resources to use on people in the hospital for other reasons. So if someone has a heart attack or a kidney infection, the hospital can‚Äôt treat them either, because there‚Äôs no room and no resources. Most people in ICUs right now are unvaccinated COVID patients, because they get more sick than vaccinated patients. The point is to keep people out of the hospital, so other people can be treated too.
1/1	people CAN refuse it and should refuse it if they have concerns. im an RN in a covid ICU and i happen to have MS- for me, the risk of getting covid and having long term effects was greater than my concern about the vaccine. i had the vaccine last week and had no side effects other than an extremely sore arm for about a day. but i support people making decisions they are comfortable with.
1/1	people acting smarter than trained physicians lmaoo we are doomed as a species
0/0	people already on their 4th shots....how many fuc#ing shots do you need for something? Give me a break
1/0	people also survived a million years without eyeglasses. So what, you're not gonna wear em if you have bad eyesight?
1/1	people always insist to stand against science, they only appricate it after years
0/0	people are hesitant to blindly trust something with unproven long term complications when it‚Äôs their life on the line, people are allowed to be skeptical, you don‚Äôt have any high ground over them
1/1	people are so willing to latch on to the latest rumours about vaccine side effects and ineffectiveness. Why is it so hard to see the real picture that having a vaccine that is PROVEN to be safe and effective after just one year of development is an entirely wonderous thing
0/0	people are still dying from covid even with the shot what good is it actually doing if you have a 50/50 chance you live or die with or without the shot. people are so naive to think the government will give out something free to benefit us. when diabetic medication is EXPENSIVE.
0/0	people are waking up on this deadly vaccine.
1/1	people disliking this video are the reason so many people keep dying... selfish fing morons
1/-1	people do not die without a Formula One car, but not without a vaccine, do they?
1/1	people don't deserve science, all those anti vacciners shall not be allowed to take it
0/0	people dont need covid vaccine people need God REPENT ALL PEOPLE
0/1	people in 2020: be careful not to catch covid!! people in 2021: lets inject covid into our arms!!
1/1	people my age will mix uppers, downers, smoke weed, do coke and drink a 12 pack of beer in 4 hours, but QUESTION HOW SAFE THE VACCINE IS.
0/1	people on the antivaccine side tend to make bold claims but no evidence to back it up.
0/0	people see through the lies
0/0	people shouldn't be taking vaccines for a virus that isn't dangerous.
1/1	people still dont understand that it doesnt take long to create vaccine now‚Ä¶ like in the old days when the flu first came out
1/1	people were willing to participate in clinical trials which was huge in getting things moving right on this vaccine!
1/1	people who are against vaccines baffle me- my sister wasn't vaccinated and she got whooping cough when she was a baby and almost died. It makes me so angry that people STILL wont vaccinate their kids.
0/0/0	people who are considered fit and healthy go in for this thing and wind up dead within hours or days, with the media saying there‚Äôs no correlation to the shot causing the death of the participant.
1	people who are vaccinated are mostly safe from COVID, yes. But they‚Äôre still not affecting only themselves! Why? Well, there‚Äôs people who can‚Äôt get vaccinated (allergies,issues with immune system etc). Also, there‚Äôs a lot of ER rooms completely full of unvaccinated people, because of this other people with urgent issues have to wait which could end badly
1/1	people will be at much greater risk by not getting vaccinated
0/1	perhaps you guys can take the vaccine yourselves, and do a daily vlog showing your results. Cheers.
0/0	personally i rather die than live in a society that doesnt respect me and my beliefs
0/0	personally know a person that was fully "vaccinated" and still got Covid-19, and nearly died twice in the hospital. He now has brain fog as a result. I saw him a few days ago, and he couldn't finish sentences because he kept losing his train of thought.

1/1	please get vaxxed
0/-1	please keep in touch with the old guy. check him every 3 months
1/1	please take the vaccine ...it gives you an active immunity... and this is to a good percentage protective! However it doesn‚Äôt mean you won‚Äôt get covid anymore..you will just be stronger to fight it!!
1/1	please, antivaxxers, do not wake me up!
1/1	please,, vaccine is to help all of humanity!
1/1	point is that the risk of acquiring natural immunity is far higher than vaccine, even if nat immunity may be nominally more robust (although my house has contracted covid 3x in the last yr, and if we were unvaxd and had more severe symptoms, natural immunity would be pointless.

0/-1	pure poison
0/0	raw garlic > vaccine
0/0	raying for my new alien family I‚Äôm banned from them because my brain works well that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm vaccine free GOOD LUCK TO ALL VACCINE PEOPLE
1/1	read the list of symptoms after getting infected and sick with Covid read that risk of death and serious illness is basically nonexistent after taking a vaccine understand primary school level statistics read about billions poured into vaccine development by countless countries, and all the emergency measures prioritising vaccines development through all the pipeline and understand that means some of the over the hundred teams would deliver fast understand that numerous specialists in the field have more gravity to their opinions than rag press, Kremlin propaganda or churches have 5G capable phone anyway Honestly, people who don't want to take vaccine for no good reason are not too smart, and are too prone to propaganda to be left to deciding on their own. Just look at what is happening in the Brasil where virus is spreading and mutating likely so fast it may outpace vaccine development. If people don't want to think about it... They're stupid and dangerous.
0/-1	reality deniers has been used up by many. A "lockdown for lunatics," as some call it
0	really struggling as a parent of 4 young boys, i personally dont see the point of putting something we dont know the long term effects of into our bodys to avoid getting something thatll be an inconvenience at best
1/1	received the Moderna vaccine 3 days ago. I feel fine so far.
0/0	refusing an experimental drug doesnt make you an antivaxxer
1/1	refusing the jab for nhs staff in my opion is a failure of duty of care and should be treated as such, unless said staff member has medical exemption
1/-1	remember folks, the symptoms of illness, the aches, pains, fever, etc. That's your immune system working, that isn't the virus itself making you feel that way, that's your body's defenses kicking on and a sign that it's taking the threat against you seriously.
1/1	remember kids even tho the needles are scary the flu or meseles were even more scary
0/1	remember kids when everyone else is doing cocaine and drinking...YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY GIVE INTO PEER PRESSURE AND JUST DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0/0	remember narcolepsi from vaccinations...
1/1	remember to get both shots AND avoid situations until a few weeks after the second shot. I had a helluva terrible reaction to second Moderna, 24 hours of pure shit but it sure beats covid.
0/0	remember ‚Äúi am legend‚Äù yeah, me too
0/1	reports emerging from Norway indicate that at least twenty three people have died after taking the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, yet the government regulator has said they don‚Äôt see anything alarming in the cases‚Ä¶
1/1/1	request every individual to take vaccine and cooperate with our Government measures and follow it properly so that we all can defeat this kind of virus easily.We have to think about the front line workers as well and pray for everyone guiding and protecting us
1/1	rich countries need to ensure the vaccine is available for all so that people can be together again and not be afraid of catching or passing on covid 19
0/0	right but yet you have a choice..... What to eat what to drink it's not a mandate it's not forced upon you so why is the vaccine
0/-1	risks outweigh benefit.. time will tell
0/0	rush hour vaccine. side effects is even Scarry

0/0	scared of dieing to the vacinnes more then covid
1/1	science have always helped human race, yet people don‚Äôt beilive in it
1/1	science is so cool, this is amazing news!
0/1/1/0	scientists who developed these vaccines are also speedrunners in their spare time confirmed
1/-1	screeching ahead on vaccinating population will be opening up to drive economy, ship excess vaccine to its friends, not EU commission! Travel from eu will be controlled as infection rates increase in Europe from the ever increasing variants. Sadly..AZ Oxford vaccine given to help Europe, EU. at cost price! The only answer, sadly the EU Commission fail the people of Europe
0/0/0/0	search results from the vaers database 'found 329 cases where vaccine targets covid-19 and patient died'.. No vaccine please
1/-1	seatbelts aren't a choice, why are vaccines?
1/1	second shot 3/22. Worth it tho, I feel so much less anxiety going to work.
1/1	see people its safe! now go get your shot, if you all are tired of the lockdowns and lost of jobs...go get your shots!
0/0	seem' to offer protection, 'appear' to 'offer' success at stopping omnicrom (a non-existent variant). How are the trials going so far?
1/1	seems like a lot of people don't wanna take it even when it is fully approved. it won't turn you into a zombie people!
1/-1	share the evidence. I‚Äôll wait. Until then, you‚Äôve been found out as a compulsive liar. Thank you for showing your intentions to make virus worse for your own sick thrills
1/-1	she claims that two of her grandchildren were injured after getting vaccines It's really easy to claim that a kid was injured by vaccines if a kid gets sick a month after the vaccination.
0/0	she knows better. she ain't getting it.......No way will I put my trust in the corrupt Pharmaceutical Companies, or the CDC , who is a vaccine company . I would be safer trusting the Mafia.
1/1	sheeple who don‚Äôt vaccinate gonna die and take you along with them smh
1/1/1/1	shot 2 done right. Feel this one a little more than first shot but I was normal and will hopefully be perfect
1/1	shots aren't even that bad, yeah it hurts, but only for a second.
0/0	shots don't work, shutdowns don't work, people will get COVID - period.
1/1	shots! shots! shots!
1/-1	should have vaccinated your mom else you wouldnt have been born retarded
0/0	show me a 90 or 100 year old person that has had multiple vaccines? not one! then show my people dying in their 60's & 70's that have had stacks of vaccines? tens of thousands or more? this debate is over.. next.
1/1	show me medication without side effects...not even aspirin
0/0	show me the evidence. there is no long term safety data, so if you are claiming they are ‚Äúsafe‚Äù you are talking out of your ass with no evidence to support your claim. The best you can say is ‚Äúthey seem safe short term, we don‚Äôt know long term‚Äù because you don‚Äôt!
0/0	side effects
0/0	side effects are not disregardful
0/0/0/0	side effects is enough, that should be telling you NOT TO TAKE THIS FARKING poison. this is nothing but fear, good little boys and girls. Bollocks! NO FING way
0/0/0	side effects, just like covid symptoms hahaha.
1/1/1	signed up to be put on the list I‚Äôm Nervous but it took a a lot for me to do this I‚Äôm proud of myself
1/1	simple solution... get the vaccine
0/0	simple, you can‚Äôt trust that it is safe !, does safe mean that it only adversly affects 3‚Äì4 people in every thousand ??, is not safe for those 3‚Äì4 acceptable ??, i personally don‚Äôt object to anyone taking the vaccine if they want to !, but why should i be forced into taking an experimental vaccine that will remain experimental for at least another year ( big pharma‚Äôs words, not mine), when they say that it won‚Äôt stop you catching the virus or for that matter, passing it on ??
1/0	simply not true the vaccine is over 90^ effective against hospitalization.
0/0	since I have had COVID my body is equipped to fight the virus as it did the second time I got covid
0/0	since all are so sure but why nor the companies nor the health ministries are accepting any responsibilities from side effects
1/1	since every COVID-19 infection gives the coronavirus a chance to mutate, being vaccinated helps prevent variants.
0/0	smart people don't do it
0/0	smells like a whole lotta BS to me.... no thanks.
1/1	so amazing! Well done to everyone who has worked tirelessly on this vaccine.
1/-1	so basically, if a bridge was 96.80%, you would prefer to swim with the 3.20%
1/1	so excited to see a vaccine in the works! let's hope that this will help get everything back to normal sooner
1/1	so far they have worked just less effectively against the new mutations, but a mutation could arise against which vaccines don't work, which is why we all need to get vaccinated really quickly, so the virus is unable to multiply and evolve.
0/0	so genetically modified humans?
0/-1	so getting a vaccine is pointless right now?
1/1	so glad i could help end this pandemic :) getting my second dose soon
1/1	so glad i got the vaccine and a booster. i caught omnicron and i know it would‚Äôve been worse n i could‚Äôve given it to my mom
1/1	so glad we can try to protect him with being vaccinated thus viral load is less in vaxed then unvaxed.
1/1	so grateful for it that we can protect ourselves and kids from risk of death and long covid issues.
0/0	so happy there's so many willing pro-Vs out there who trust big pharma with their own lives. so we don't have to.
0/0	so if i die after i taken my 2nd and 3rd dose youll just say i died of corona you wont admit its your mistake
1/0	so in order of importance. 1- fire 2- the wheel 3- tv remote 4- vaccines.
1/1	so it became way worse just because of those... people... who didn't vaccinate, great -.- (Nothing against people that aren't able to get the vaccine, only against those who chose to not vacciante)
1/1	so looking at your logic it seems that you would suggest we abandoned the smallpox vaccine the MMR vaccine the ebola vaccine the HPV vaccine the polio vaccine the typhoid vaccine? What's different about the covid vaccine AJ ??? It's just the way we fight viral disease ? Why is this so hard for you to understand?
1/1	so many effective vaccines already, let‚Äôs keep producing them so everybody around the world has access. We can do it!!!
0/-1	so many refusing to be vaccinated
0/0	so my take on the experiment and dagerous
1/1	so that's unfortunate but the first hospitalization was before the vaccines took effect... if anythng you just proved your natural immunity didnt help you
1/1	so the vaccine that had multiple phase trials, no deaths, no hospitalizations, with success, is bad?
0/0	so this is how it starts.....6 today....how many next year?
0/0	so vaccines simply reduce the severity of the symptoms. ok. so then give it to those that are at the highest risk of dying from it right? ohhh never mind because the vaccine is also deadly to the "most frailest" aka the people at highest risk of dying from the virus... one is avoidable and the other authoritarian anti human rights assholes want to make mandatory. listen if any of you want to be literal lab rats that take the vaccine and die from it or maybe not knowing the vaccine makers have been given special protections against being held liable because of the known risks associated with such careless implementation then so be it but dont go forcing it on everyone else. if they told you the truth you would not take the vaccine but no they baby you and sugar coat it to make you feel like absolutely nothing can go wrong if you take it. it should be required by law that you know and understand the risks and why those risks exist and then you should have the ability to decide whether or not if you want to take those risks. i for one standing a better chance of winning the lottery than dying of covid would much rather just get covid than to take a new vaccine that has little to no testing and a rushed development cycle. when it comes to things liek the flu shot sure because we have had decades to do research and development for it but some thing like covid? hell no. a virus that of which not a single person on this planet had a physical sample of the virus for the first several months of the pandemic per the CDC and has mutated at least 3 times within a single year and you expect me to think its irrational not to get the rushed vaccine without question? craziness.
0/0	so when‚Äôs the funeral
0/0	so why does this vaccine change your RNA and DNA ?I no folks that have died from the vaccine with no health conditions?
1/0	so y'all care about long term effects of the vaccine but not covid?
1/1	so you don‚Äôt trust doctors and epidemiologists who study this stuff for a living?! Ô∏è If they get it I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs fine. Remember, if you get COVID you can be asymptomatic but the virus can still do a lot of damage to your heart and other organs. So if you‚Äôre heart muscle is weakened you‚Äôre 10x more likely to have a complication from the yearly flu or even a cold. And it may be easier for you to get pneumonia as well.
1/1	some of you are thick as hell. 89% is so much higher than the current 0% we‚Äôve had for a year. Try counting to 89 and be more mindful in how long that takes compared to counting to one. Also, Be bloody grateful you‚Äôre still here and have even been able to see a vaccine develop - some people haven‚Äôt been so lucky!!!
1/0	some of you guys are not smart and it shows. ‚Äúhow did he catch covid if he vaccinated‚Äù well if you knew have vaccines worked you won‚Äôt be askin such a stupid ass question. just cuz you get vaccinated don‚Äôt mean you not finna catch it it just means you not gonna have the severity
1/-1	some people are vulnerable, but they can't take vaccines due to various reasons, they will rely the fellow citizens in the society to provide them the herd protection from the threat. So even people are not vulnerable, as a conscientious collective species, they are supposed to be smart enough to realize their responsibility for the survival of our whole human race.
0/-1	some people just really don't get that not everything is about them.
0/1	someone commented "when ignorance stays, intelligence moves on". congrats on the vaccine :)

0/0	still not getting that poisonous vaccine. deal with it
0/0	still not taken the vaccine every one i know who has had there booster is now sick with omicron ...dont know if any one else has found the this also
1/1	still would go for covaxin any day!
1	stop being dumb ppl, just take it already
0/0	stop persuading people to take something unknown and hasn‚Äôt been tested long term!
1/1	strong protection as vaccine mimics the natural infection process
0/0	swedes have learned from experience to not take any new vaccine. we will gladly wait to see what the effects are to avoid a repeat of the swine flu vaccine which ended up being statistically more dangerous than the swine flu were, not even close.
1/1	synthetic viruses during wars can always bring back eradicated diseases. Good to have vaccines , just in case.
1/1	t is absolutely incredible how far we've come in science and medicine. We all owe a great deal of gratitude to the thousands of hard-working scientists and doctors who are helping us end this pandemic. So thankful.
1/1	take polio shots, never get polio.
1/1	take the Moderna one. It's safer.
1/1	take the vaccine and everything turns back to normal. if you refuse then we will be in this forever. think about others!
0/0	take your Vax and shove it as hard as humanly possible up your A$$
0/0	takin the vaccine is literally putting a computor in the body!!!
0/0	taking a vaccine that‚Äôs been out for only about a year seems more idiotic for a sickness with over a 99 percent survival rate
1/1	taking the shots soon. I have faith in humanity
1/1	talking about international effort, more details about the mRNA vaccines really shined some light to me what we really accomplished and what we still can accomplish as a society if we just dedicate ourselves to it! Much love to anyone who reads this and stay strong we'll get through this!
0/0	tbh I do not like vaccines. so ngl no vaccine for mee
1/1	tbh I think the gamble really comes into the effects. the side effects from vaccinations occur at way less of a frequency than the adverse effects of covid
1/1	tbh these anti-vaxxers are kinda weird
1/1	tedros. I would like to go and get a covid vaccine
1/1	tell people to wear a mask, stay socially distanced, and get vaccinated.
0/-1	tell you what, I will sacrifice my shot and give it to one of you :)))).
1/1	thank god my granda is getting his vaccine tomorrow and my nanny in a few weeks
0/0	thank u millions for being the guinea pigs, u never try the first version of stuff without working out the kinks i'll wait until i'm forced to take it and take my chances with covid
1/-1	thank you
1/1	thank you Pfizer for the Vaccine I had my 2nd dose last March 25/21 no side effects!
1/-1	thank you all at MedCram - super helpful all the time and comforting in arming us with knowledge
1/1	thank you and all of the people who worked so hard to develop the Covid vaccine. I got my first dose on Friday. My only reaction was a slightly sore arm at the injection site.
1	thank you for giving the importance of why we should vaccinate
1	thank you for telling me this I know my sister got the one so I'm going to get the Mederma I'm happy that everything's okay with both of you yay
1/1	thank you for the explanations. I hope it will convince some people to get vaccinated.
1/1	thank you for volunteering...I am scheduled to get in the ph 3 J&J ph 3 study next week....so many people so quick to put down these studies and if it wasnt for people like you and me, a lot more people would die of this virus as well as many other diseases, in particular cancer!
1/1/0/1	thank you for your message. we need more of this in the world right now. because the subject has many confusing elements to it (e.g. exponential growth, CFR vs IFR, excess deaths, the flu kills x) people are getting confused. many do not accept how serious it is and think the figures are trumped up.
1/1	thank you so much for easing certain doubts.... a few of us nursing students will be getting the vaccine soon and i think we'll take our chances!
1/1	thank you so much for easing certain doubts.... a few of us nursing students will be getting the vaccine soon and i think we'll take our chances! ?
1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1	thank you so much for making a video like this, I know that some people, no matter how much evidence you show them, will still deny it and be scared, but it certainly helps having people logically explain how safe this stuff actually is
1/1	thank you so much for this information, Ted-Ed!! I just got vaccine yesterday and now I feel that my muscle is sore. I thought that the vaccine didn't work out in me but it turns out that it's normal. once again, thank you ted-ed
1	thank you, my hopes are raised, I might be vaccinated
1/1	thankful for these people who are willing to help the process for the betterment of the world. You guys are warriors!!!
1/1	thanks a lot for making this video. im getting my first vaccine on friday and was pretty nervous about the long term affects. feel a lot better about my decision to get vaccinated now.
1/1	thanks a lot for the clear explanation. So is the vaccine safe and effective.
1/1	thanks for this video. I've been around family who are very anti-vax and I felt like I was becoming worried with all the fearmongering they were doing - I really needed this information to snap me out of it! Sometimes people's thoughts turn into an echo chamber, and you never hear rational, well-researched points of reasoning. Thank you for this high quality video! I'll definitely be sharing it.
1/1	thanks i‚Äôm less worried about catching it bc ive been fully vaccinated and have gotten the booster and have a pretty strong immune system as it is so if i do get it i most likely won‚Äôt be very sick, but im more worried about possibly spreading it to others
1/1	thanks. All I‚Äôm saying is of the 4 1/2 million deaths from covid, far less than 1% of those are from fully vaccinated. Vaccines save lives, which is a fact.
1/1	thankyou for such intelligent humans....i have currently covid...its very nasty disease, just like animal disease, its like lot of virus sit in your nose, making unable to you to breath, ...which jump to humans respiratory system....respect for such intelligent people who can make such medicine
1/1	that beautiful light blue color around the Bay Area shows we have very low vaccine hesitancy here! Bay Area proud baby
0/0	that is aweful to hear! i am unvaccinated and proud! no need to gamble my health for something i dont need.
0/-1	that is not needed at all cause immune systems do that anyways
1/1	that makes me feel a bit better about my vaccinated self
0/0	that means personal responsibility which is something people find offensive. I'd rather be responsible for myself than to trust someone else- or a doctor or gov't
0/0	that vaccine doesn't work, it's just for your peace of mind
0/0	that vaccine has given me a massive flu, fever and all my bones are aching
0/0	that vaccine has given me a massive flu, fever and all my bones are aching, stupid vaccine!
0/0	that vaccine isn't going anywhere in my body, let everybody else be guinea pigs..
0/0	that vaccines clearly killing people and yall expect ppl to get it
1/1	that's a normal reaction to the vaccine,most people have that.she should be fine soon
1/1	that's great to hear! Im still waiting for the vaccine to be available to me. My whole family has been fully vaccinated and im still waiting for the vaccine to be ready for teens but when it's been tested and out im taking the vaccine
0/0	that's what the clinical trials are for - would be nice if they were complete before we pushed this on everyone. not everyone wants to sign up for the trial and be part of the experiment.
1/0	that's what this whole vaccine thing is ment to do...It's ment to weaken your immune system so that you will eventually be dependent on it to survive.
0/-1	thats a lie if u get covid you dont need to put the disease in your body why are you that weak quit being so weak
0/0/0	thats like saying- shoot me in the head first- and i will take notes afterward...
0/0	that‚Äôs strange. everyone I know who has the vaccine now has a perpetual cough, and keeps getting sick over and over again. I‚Äôve been doing 60 hour weeks because they‚Äôre constantly calling in sick.
0/0	the 'current' vaccine that doesnt protect you from getting or giving covid is already useless.
1/1	the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine already had its 3rd trial which supports its positive results elsewhere in the World
1/0	the People who think that the scary stuff in vaccines should be removed are not anti-vaccine, they‚Äôre anti-science
1/1	the UK, Canada and now the US are authorizing the use of the Pfizer vaccine! if it is OK for them why not us? What on earth are the EMA doing.....! perhaps the UK did do the right thing by authorizing the vaccine on their own and forgetting about the dumb solidarity of EU's licensing programme....!
1/1	the amount of anti-vaxxers in the comments is scary. if you don't want the vaccine, do not complain about no getting to travel this summer/this year.
1/-1	the amount of antivax friends i have is ASTOUNDING!! and i had no clue!!
0/0	the amount of women going infertile from these vaccines makes me want to do unspeakable shit
1/1	the anti vax people. Simply ridiculous.
1/1/1	the antivaccines people are that type of people who said "i don t know" if they re ask for their allergies
1/1	the benefits of this vaccine far outweighs the risk of anything else
1/1	the best thing people can do, is stop watching the "news"..
1/1	the best vaccine is the first one you have access to
0/-1	the best way to cure covid 19 is to stop watching tv
1/1	the big problem is the lake of trust in poletics and the unfaer system. Thats al
1/1	the country needs more vaccines and we need them fast.. We are all wanting to do them.!!
0/0	the covid vaccine and its consequences have been a disaster for mankind
1	the covid vaccine has a lower risk rate than a lot of vaccines
1/1	the data supports vaccines being safe and effective at preventing serious illness and death.
1/1	the day you filmed this was the date of my second shot. and yeah it was a lil rough. it was like a one and a half day flu ü§í but i‚Äôd take that over a month of covid!!!
0/0	the deaths are from the vaccines are rising
0/0	the difference: the polio vaccine actually worked to prevent people from getting and transmitting polio. unlike the covid "vaccine" that necessitated a change in the definition of "vaccine" in order for it to even be called a "vaccine".
0/0	the drug companies have no liability should anything go wrong.
0/-1	the end is near the end is near!!!
1/1	the endless cycle only continues if people dont get the vaccine
1/1/1/-1	the expectation in government is that for the next few years people will need regular booster jabs to protect against new variants of covid, as with the flu jab
0/0	the fact companies that make it can't be held accountable for the people who have died from it is disturbing.
0/0/0/0	the fact that some people gladly show off their ‚ÄúVaccine shots‚Äù on social media and are so glad, makes me wonder how different some people really are
1/1	the first dose is fairly effective and will prevent most from dying
0/0	the flu vaccine brings out the flu so wouldn't the covid-19 vaccine bring out covid-19 in someone bc that's why i never get a flu shot!!
0/-1	the good news is my kid does not have small pox. the bad news is he bangs his head into the wall all day. and can't talk.
1/1	the government are trying to save lives, get your vaccine done
0/0	the government controls the vaccines therefore they re all bad
0/0	the government wants to control us, they can litterarly make us do anything. I'm not letting anyone inject anything in me!
0/0	the govt wants to put their crap in me, no way that‚Äôs happening
0/0	the horrible side effects from this shot are much worse for us, personally.
0/0	the human body is 99.997 effective, why would i take some rushed illgates poison ?
0/0	the immune system is one of the most complicated systems in the body. we are nowhere near understanding all the feedback loops and mechanisms in it. To alter it by having your body constantly produce a trigger is unwise. like injecting pollen daily into asthmatics.
0/0	the jab is the disease; that they just classify as Covid, actually they classify as "long Covid". If it was not the jab, how could they patent it ?.
1/1	the last administration hadn't set up any distribution plans and this one is trying to get caught up. He's only had 2 weeks.
0/0	the last time I was vaccinated it put me into a two day coma. So I‚Äôm done with vaccines. Especially EXPERIMENTAL ones.
1	the level of immunity provided by the vaccines after having COVID-19 is higher than the level of immunity for those who had COVID but were not subsequently vaccinated.
1/1	the list of ingredients for Moderna/Pfizer are incredibly simple, and none of them concerned me as a pharmacist
0/0	the literal CEO of Pfizer wasn‚Äôt thinking about money when deciding how much to invest in the vaccine development, really??
0/0	the long term side effects of these vaccines wont be realized until 3-5 yrs. after taking them. I am, not gonna take it‚Ä¶
1/1	the mRNA in the vaccine never enters the nucleus of the cell because it doesn‚Äôt have the necessary signal. But, even if it did, mRNA would need to be converted into DNA via an enzyme the vaccine doesn‚Äôt possess. Thus it is indeed safe!
0/0/1/0	the main stream media already said it would take a miracle for a vaccine that be out this early. So no I'm not gonna take one.
0/0	the majority of people I see come in the hospital with covid received the vaccine. It doesn't help whatsoever. You can still catch it, spread it and end up in the hospital. Not sure what this vaccine is or does but it's not for covid.
1/-1	the most frustrating thing is that antibiotics cause more harm than vaccines, and yet no one is saying how bad they are
0/0	the most vaccinated country have the most cases and the less vaccinated the less cases!!!a total rip off who make peoples sick!!
1/1	the nice thing is that we don't need to leave a choice, the government can mandate it.
1/-1	the only person that should't the vaccine is that one guy on gta that's level 1,000 or higher
1/1	the only side effect i had from the covid vaccine was all the bad dreams i had last night
1/1	the only silent war against humanity is the anti vaxxers trying to derail an attempt to fight a pandemic. Why on earth do people think it is right to not comply to social distancing which is helping minimise the spread, and use a vaccine to help with slowing down serious illness admissions to hospitals. That‚Äôs the real war on humanity you should be protesting about, yet some are too deluded and too dense to realise that
0/0/1/0	the only thing I'm going to wear strapped to my body anymore is my 9 mm. NO MORE MASKS!
1/1	the only way to avoid getting infected by the deadly Covid19 virus is to CONTINUE to PRACTICE the HEALTH PROTOCOL of SOCIAL DISTANCING, WEARING of FACE MASK & FACE SHIELD in CROWDED AREA or PLACE & WASHING YOUR HANDS EVERY TIME YOU TOUCH Any thing.
1/1	the only way to the freedom is taking this vaccine‚Äô
1/1	the people who say that they would have preferred awareness campaigns rather than having the vaccine imposed on them I don't know if you've noticed but the state has been trying to raise awareness since January
1/1	the point of a vaccine is to train your immune system before you get infected. That way it acts quicker and it's more effective when you do get COVID. That helps prevent sickness or at least severe forms of the illness.
1/1	the problem now is that the unvaxxed are creating a training ground that the virus can use to create more resistant strains. It's a bit like trying to stave off a meth comedown with more meth. It's not gonna go well.
1/0	the problem with must of you is that you will gladly drink, eat, snore and inject poisons in your body, your precious temple........you must hate yourself so much and you rather believe in the 'devil'
0/0/0	the reason is money. we are vaccinating for unecessary childhood illnesses, and worse we are making them manditory.
0/0	the reason theyre threatening to make it mandatory or you lose your ability to go in public, and hire celebrities to ad their gene experimentation jab is because MOST dont want it. if they really had so much demand, they wouldnt need to advertise it so much. and think about it... it's always "safe and effective"
1/1	the religious exemption nonsense for the vaccine is bad enough (your religious beliefs do not grant you the right to endanger other people‚Äôs lives) but TESTS???'
1/1	the reward for people under 40 is that they won't get sick, AND that they will be protecting their parents and other older people in their community. where did you get this 5-10% from? no, vaccines don't make you sterile.
1/1	the risk is lower than Birth control, why aren't birth control being ban immediately?
1/1	the risks from taking vaccines are astronomically lower than the risks from the diseases the vaccines
1/0	the risks of getting covid outweigh the risks of the vaccine
1/1	the risks of getting vaccinated are very very low but the risks of not getting vaccinated are very high.
1/1	the risks of getting vaccinated are very very low but the risks of not getting vaccinated are very high. if enough people are vaccinated then the anti vaxxers will be fine because of herd immunity but if no one gets vaccinated, they will all be seriously ill and die at a younger age.
0/0	the safest option is to not bother ,rely on your own defences ,the fact that the media wont even entertain a grown up conversation is evidence enough for me thanks
1/-1	the salt in his voice when he mentioned antivax was enough to cure a pig
1/1	the sheer amount of mental gymnastics you have to do in order to be antivax‚Ä¶
0/0	the shot just killed a friend of mine ,the first one made him feel bad and the second one killed him . severe side effects are going unreported to keep people getting the shots .Clovis Fikes was his name .
0	the side effects I seen are enough not to take it.. as for the unknown side effects that are probly just as grave walking around in the vaccinated if contagious ü§îthey would never amit it like for example omicron ? could that be from the vaccine shot ? ü§î
1/1	the side effects are minimal and no one has died from the vaccine while many people have died from covid. which is why you need to get vaccines on a schedule? Not just this Covid one. But every vaccine. It‚Äôs the same reason you need to get your flu shot yearly. To make sure that you‚Äôre effectively protected
1/1	the side effects are still better then getting covid
0/0	the side effects are worse then covid
0/-1	the side effects like joint pain, fatigue, having your entire body's organs monitored and evendestroyed by the tech particles in it, fever, etc.. U know, just the usual
0/0	the so-called COVID-19 ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù don‚Äôt work like vaccines. They‚Äôre designed to lessen symptoms when the inoculated person gets infected, but they do not actually prevent them from getting infected in the first place, and they don‚Äôt prevent the spread of the virus.
1/1	the solution: get vaccinated
1/1	the stupidity in this world today is maddening. I truly feel awful for healthcare workers.
0/0/0	the thing Im mostly amazed with is people thinking the government cares about them. A relative of mine just died the day after she got vaccine. THIS IS TRUE!
1/-1	the thoughts of these scientists doing actual productive research to the betterment of humankind.... and then there's tictok - ers like charlie & bella, earning as much, if not more.... just makes me wonder tf is wrong with the world.
1/-1	the unvaxxed are marching.
0/0	the va$$ines are killing people
0/0	the vaccination is literally pointless
0/0	the vaccination is more dangerous than the disease. We know the survival rate for COVID-19 and it is not deadly enough to warrant taking a rushed and untested vaccine in which there may be very negative long term consequences
0/0	the vaccine can infect my child with the disease it's trying to prevent
0/0	the vaccine does not effectively prevent Delta infection, nonetheless the drug pushers are trying to force people to inject junk science into their veins.
0/0	the vaccine doesn't exist.
0/0	the vaccine has not been tested long enough, moreover, not all side effects and after-effects are known yet.
1/1	the vaccine has saved lives. It‚Äôs been the lesser of two evils for many people. For other people natural exposure is a better option. There is no all encompassing answer. Each person is different. Some people wouldn‚Äôt survive Covid without the vaccine. That‚Äôs a fact.
0	the vaccine in 100% experamental we know nothing of what will happen.
0/1	the vaccine is a gift from God, the sooner you get vaccinated, the sooner you meet him
0/0	the vaccine is a scam
0/0	the vaccine is as as "safe and effective" as their President is competent and legitimate
1/1	the vaccine is finally working
0/0	the vaccine is just so new that I don‚Äôt want to take it.
0/0	the vaccine is killing so many fragile, elderly. that should frighten everyone
0/1	the vaccine is made by man and man is not perfect. how can we expect that it will be perfect and free of any side effects
0/0	the vaccine is more deadly than theh covid itself.
1/1	the vaccine is not debatable. it is proven to work and if you disagree you are simply wrong
0/0	the vaccine is not effective enough
1/1/0	the vaccine is not live COVID
1/1	the vaccine is our best line of defense against this awful pandemic.
1/1	the vaccine is our only chance right now in ending this pandemic and we all want our lives back, I think you can't do wrong in getting it. I understand that it can be frightening but all vaccines that are available in your country are well tested and effective
1/1	the vaccine is safe and effective at preventing serious illness and hospitalization
0/0	the vaccine is safe it might just kill you.
0/0	the vaccine is the government way of controlling us state
0/0	the vaccine literally almost killed my uncle.
1/1	the vaccine means that a new hope is coming that thie nightmare might end and we might get back to our normal life...
0/-1	the vaccine passport isn't technological advancement it's misuse of technology
0/0	the vaccine released a yr ago has NO impact on omicron &amp; very little (if any) impact on delta. the booster is built off the base strain as well. i am absolutely shocked more people don't feel duped &amp;/or livid that they are still pushing this nonsense. i cant be alone in this.
1/1	the vaccine rollout's been going really well here but we cannot fix people who think that covid/vaccination/public health is a hoax
1/1/1/1/1/1	the vaccine should be mandatory
0/0	the vaccine will kill us all
0/0	the vaccines are dangerous
1/1	the vaccines can WORK‚Ä¶they are working for so many other disease..now also for the virus!!
0/1	the vaccines cannot change our DNA because human cells have no mechanism to convert rna into dna but it can be done artificially in a lab and also our cells don‚Äôt contain th necessary enzymes to do this and neither does the vaccine. So, these vaccines are not changing anyone's genes, it is impossible for an mRNA vaccine to alter our DNA
1/1	the vaccines have already started to change my community! things are reopening like schools, restaurants for indoor dining, Theme parks and movie theaters, And much more! Thank god we have this vaccine!
1/1	the vaccines were as effective as promised but variants happened
0/0	the vaccines were the carrot on the end of the stick to give people something to wait for, I'm afraid it was a false hope, it was a cynical move on their part, the sickest thing is it caused them to block all other forms of early treatment.
1/1/1	the vaccines work beautifully. To prevent serious infections and deaths, to prevent the spread, to save lives. We ALL know that we could still get it but thanks to the vaccine our immune system already knows what to do. Now let' s try THIS as an headline!
1/1	the vaccines work excellently at preventing hospitalization and severe disease
1/1	the vast majority of people who get vaccinated dont' have it worse than unvaccinated people
0/0	the vax just isn't for me. I'm not frightened of it...just don't want or need it
1/-1	the virus has so far caused 2 million deaths worldwide. Not to speak of long-term damage. That's just the deaths. A thoroughly tested vaccination (yes, it is) can't be that bad.
1/1	the virus wont be gone but it will unlikely spread widely due to vaccines.
1/0	the whole anti-vaxxer movement is basically a bunch of peoole saying "i can medicine better than doctors"
0/0	the worst part is the sh!t aint even a vaccine smh.
0/0	then catching covid also works
0/0	then u realize vaccines aren‚Äôt safe
1/1	there are a lot of people who got covid after vaccination but as the tweet says unvaccinated are 97 times more likely to die. if you understand basic math you will know why vaccination is important. embrace it rather than fight it. facts are clearly against those who are hesitant
1/1	there are now 5 million people in cemeteries who let their immune systems work through it!
0/-1	there has never been any successful vaccine for coronaviruses in humans due to a problem typical of coronavirus vaccine development called antibody dependent enhancement or ADE
0/0	there hasn't been enough time to say " no long term side effects".
0/-1	there is lacking research on long term side effects
0/0	there is no clue of what the side effects are
0/0	there is no covid we don't need a vaccine
1/1	there is no need to be afraid from the vaccine. Everything gonna be alright
1/1	there is no reason not to vaccinate your kids
0	there isnt enough money in this world to pay me to take that shot...
0/0	there no such thing as a vaccine for RNA viruses, this has never been done before nor can it be done, there is also no such thing as a coronavirus more dangerous than your regular flu.
0/0	there was not yet enough evidence from vaccine trials "to be confident that it's going to prevent people from actually getting the infection and therefore being able to pass it on
1/1	there's a 0.01% chance that I'll trip and injure myself while walking anti vaxxers: guess I won't walk
0/0	there's also studies that show the effectiveness of vaccines against infection drop off to near zero within a few months
0/0	there's something very dark and sinister about this vaccine
0/0	theres no evdence of a pandemic
1/1	there‚Äôs no reason for an able-bodied person to not get the vaccine unless you seem to enjoy lockdowns and mask rules
1/1	there‚Äôs nothing wrong with believing in a conspiracy as long as it doesn‚Äôt intend to harm others. Yet trying to convince people to take a chance on their health by denying vaccines all the time and using covid 19 as an excuse to preach their anti vaxxer nonsense is not right at all.
1/1	these anti vaccine people dont see the bigger picture.
0/0	these are NOT vaccines, they are genetic manipulation - as per Pfizer & Monsanto
0/0	these are not vaccines they are gene therapies experimental not approved by the FDA this one has aborted baby parts in it Wake up America
1/1	these idiots can‚Äôt admit that people who have gotten vaccinated aren‚Äôt dying. it‚Äôs the ones who won‚Äôt that are. all of these ‚Äúthe vaccine doesn‚Äôt work‚Äù assholes think they‚Äôre so fucking cute until they catch covid. then it‚Äôs all ‚Äúgofundme‚Äù and ‚Äúwould have given the shirt off their back‚Äù. FUCK. YOU.
1/1	these people are overreacting‚Ä¶my parents got their vaccine and are doing perfectly fine
1/1	these vaccines are safe and effective
1/1	these vaccines were made in a very different way, mrna, and becouse of lot of funding, a lot of people volunteering for vaccines trials, new technology and past knowledge about previous epidemics and the virus has a very slow rate of mutation
0/0	they also skipped animal trials. There is no way I am getting that vaccine. I will move states if they require it I am not taking that vaccine.
1/1	they are a variety of vaccines based on 10 year old or even 50 year old technology (based on an idea from the 1700s). And they have been tested. On thousands of people. And approved by multiple health authorities.
0/0/0/0/0/0/0	they can shove that vaccine where the sun dont shine.... i refuse to take anything they have to offer
0/0	they create the virus. Now they want to gigypig us all
0/-1	they don't trust it..
1/0	they had a reaction but not too nasty but the BBC think better run a scare story so the Twitter fools can rant.
0/0	they had to dump 15 million doses two weeks ago. No thank you...
0/0	they have been vaccinating for however long and yet the flu returns year after year in new variants. my family stopped taking the flu shots and we stopped getting the flu every year. so i am talking from personal experience. I say NO to this covid19 vaccine and that is my personal choice. We still have freedom of choice right?
0/0	they have not been thoroughly tested over time - producing effective, safe antisera takes far more time than these have been given. They are being touted as safe and effective, but check out different studies - there are many undesirable side effects. And you can never be unvaccinated
1/1	they have not been. The information is readily available. Unfortunately, most people don't do any actual research because it takes time. If they did they would understand that there have been no deaths attributed to the vaccines. As for injuries, all side effects are listed and resolved but this information isn't looked for either.
1/1	they just don't get it. I'm absolutely pro vax and think the idea of mandates to be absolutely asinine and precisely why I'm posting here right now.
0/0	they should stop claiming the vax is 97% effective. It is 0% effective as does not protect you from getting virus and it is 0.183% effective to protect you from dying as this is how many people died in USA from covid 600K that died divided by 328 MLN people in USA. Hmm wow very effective? Nonsense
0	they started giving vacine but even after the taking shot same people again infected of Corona Virus so wt is the use of giving vacine.
0/0	they will establish a new world order with the vaccines
0/0	they will hide behind the fact that the virus has mutated from the original strain, which the vaccine was designed to prevent. Of course they won't say a word as to why they are still giving this same vaccine out to address current and future strains, none of which are the strain that the vaccine supposedly protects against.
1/1	they will require vaccination because they are trying to save lives! If you haven't taken the vaccine, and COVID is still spreading, you are a threat to society! We need most people to take the vaccine for COVID to actually go away. Even if there are unknown long term side effects, we do know that COVID is dangerous and has killed almost a million people and must be eradicated!
1/1	they work they work they work they work!!!!! Do the vaccines asap‚Ä¶
0/0	they're using the vaccine passport and the nano machines in the vaccine to track us. disgusting
0/0/0/0	they've been giving vaccinations for decades, and not one has been successful to any great percentage...count me out...I'll rely on God and my natural defenses.
0/0	they‚Äôd also be gambling by getting the vaccines. Vaccines have been known to cause SIDS, epilepsy and other serious conditions or death. They‚Äôre both risky.
0/0	they‚Äôre not telling us what the vaccine is made out of
1/1	thick anti vaxxers should do some real research and stop regurgitating bull from disgraced doctors who are making a mint.
0/0	think Covid-19 is not a problem
1/1	think about this.... Think about protection
0/0	this CONFIRMS the vaccines are another lie
0	this a scam either there is no syrum in the vaccine or the oil enters the syringe do not trust what it has shown you without having formal proof
1/1	this can save millions of lives
1/1/1	this great news about the the Vaccine, why so many dislikes???
1/0	this is actually pretty amazing. That means if you actually get infected(chance of infection is 1/20th of non-vaccinated)you have much better chances of not getting severely sick.
1/1	this is amazing
1/0	this is amezing wwery gratefull for this good explanation
0/1	this is an untried new type of RNA Vaccine...paints any kind of Vaccine reluctance as 'anti-vax' in its patently disgusting biased non - journalism.
1/-1	this is awesome
0/0	this is experimental, is being used under emergency authorization
0/0/0	this is good info, i'll pass on the vaccine. my body my choice right?
1/-1	this is interesting
0/0	this is not the same as a seatbelt in any way. Besides, you can choose not to wear a seatbelt. That doesn‚Äôt deny you the right to own or drive a car. Just like you can choose not to have a vaccine. That should NOT deny you the right to perform any function in your daily life. Some people will be unable to be vaccinated- what about them? Maybe the whole solution is that if YOU have a problem or concern, YOU should stay home and abstain from life. NONE of this was required a year ago, and NONE of this should be required now.
0/0	this is really stupid move to vaccine people,when we have less people dieing .
1/1	this is so helpful tbh. I'm going to get the vaccine when they have one in our town.
1/1	this is so sad can we have vaccine parties
0/0	this is what happens whne drugs are not properly trialed
1/-1	this is where the eu are slow again the uk have already ordered vaccines for 2022 and 2025
0/0	this is why i never take vaccines! the only times i took them was 3to 4!!!
0/0	this is why they want to force or shame everyone to get it , so they don't have an unvaccinated population to prove how many thousands or millions they kill by being failed vaccine
1/1	this is why we need M4A, so people actually visit their doctor and cut back on all the woo woo pseudoscience nut job substitute for healthcare. Not having healthcare as a human right is morally wrong and destroying the country
1/1	this isn't about politics. COVID is killing people and we need to save lives. It's very important to actually look at the facts and realize that you need to take the vaccine
1/0	this made me realise that cells are smarter then antivaxxers
0/0	this poison so called vaccine doesnt stop you catching this flu let alone stopping you from spreading it" best result they say ??? is that it softens the side effects from this flu" and guess what many new strains are being reported worldwide which will make it completly useless " jab on brainless sheep"
0/0	this should not be called vax. It doesn‚Äôt work on the same basis. It‚Äôs genetic coding that‚Äôs unproven in experimental stage. That should be enough to scare any sane person.
1/0	this vaccine also uses a novel method of action, using mrna encoding the virus rather than the virus itself. fantastic proof of concept for new technology
0/0	this vaccine brought to you by big pharma, pls give us your money we will use it to make more viruses thanks
1/1	this vaccine is safe.
0/0	this vaccine my have had a lot of tests But not the test of time
1/1	this vaccine works and it bypassed animal studies and basic long term safety tests.
1/1	this video changed me i will take any vaccine i can get.
1/1/1	this video has slammed these idiotic anti vaccine communities on their reasons to avoid vaccination
0/0	this whole vaccine trail just feels like the start of every zombie movie.
0/0	those are GENE THERAPIES not vaccines . No way im gonna take it
1/1	those doctors didn't go through 10+ years of school to have someone who makes clothes tell them about 50% of their course material. Girl, they know it's safe-ish better than having your child dead-ish.
0/0	those vaxed who are worried about those not vaxed dont believe in the vax
0/-1	thousands dying, good to know ‚Äúskinwalker joe‚Äù is safe
1/1	time to get ur vaccine
1/1	time will prove this vaccined helped human race
1/1	to add to this: i got both pfizer vaccines too and after my first shot i had about 4 days of cold symptoms and after the second shot my arm was sore for about a week. otherwise, i was and am perfectly fine
1/1	to all the people with their little tinfoil hats, gl.
0/0	to be clear, none of the mRNA vaccines produced or approved for EUA use, have passed all trials required by fda
1/1	to be honest with you I just can‚Äôt wait to have my vaccines, one more one less it won‚Äôt change much since i‚Äôm still going to die one day. but with the vaccine at least i‚Äôll feel better psychologically
0/0	to me the vaccine is one way for the government to wipe millions of people out without pulling a trigger
1/1	to stop covid 19 - vaccine!
1/-1	to the naysayers, you know you can choose not to get vac right,if you so kiasi, you can be the last one to vac after everybody as long as you not kiasu
1/1	to the people who are against the vaccine, ur stupid af.
1/1	today, florida has 203 deaths and 400 hospitalizations. we need vaccinations here asap for all ages. or for the peope that want the vaccine at least.

0/0	trust your own immune system‚Ä¶
1/1	ty dr fauci, mr and mrs colbert, mr batiste and stay human! i was given j&j, remembered you saying that on the news and jumped for it rather than wait and just hope.
1/1	uhhhhh they will be the ones alive you idiot.
0	uk gov has to wind down covid figures just so sheep believe that vaccine working when its probably contributing to more side effects or deaths.Whos betting that they continue this and tease coming out of lockdown and then at last moment reveal some cooked up new mutant variant.
1/1	unvaccinated people caused insurance rates to go up by using medical facilities unnecessarily. If you don't believe in the vaccine then you shouldn't be going to the hospital for treatment once you catch it.
1/1	unvaccinated people had infection rates 3.6 times higher than people who had received boosters and hospitalization rates were 23 times higher. I have come to the conclusion that the unvaccinated do not understand numbers, either that or they believe when they die there will be 72 Stormy Daniels waiting for them
1/1	unvaccinated people should have to deal with passports and masks, people who did the right thing should not be punished.
1/1	upon receiving my second dose of the covid vaccine today, i thanked my nurse for all of her service. she said it was her honor and she thanked me for my service in return
1/1	ust got my second dose Sunday and all I got was a sore arm. The next day I felt just the sore arm and by night time I was good. The next day all normal. Just get it done you‚Äôll be happy and glad you‚Äôre done with already. Yes I was skeptical at first but because i have a comorbidity I got it rather than get covid and have 10x worse
1/1	usually, in order for a pandemic becomes an endemic, it first goes from pandemic to epidemic, and then to endemic. Scince we are in an epedemic, take the vaccine to help the hospitals
0/0	v for vaccine, v for virus, v for vegans. Coincidence? I think not

0/-1	vaccine effectiveness wont be long
1/1	vaccine efficacy all I have to say is that having had mild to moderate covid (which was brutal) I'd very happily be jagged in the arm with something that didn't protect much against that in the future but still did a fair bit to stop me from ending up in hospital or dying

1/0	vaccines have been common place for 100 years. What makes you think the stuff in this one is any different than the other vaccines out there. Same basic stuff
0/-1	vaccines have certain risks
1/1	vaccines have probably saved billions of lives, a tried and true method!
0/0	vaccines have uncertain risks
0/0	vaccines kill people this is looking for trouble Modernedicine is stupid
0/0	vaccines most likely cause lower fertility and cancer, while at the same time protecting you from diseases. the pro vacc bots are in this thread
0/0	vaccines never eradicated anything but natural herd immunity!!! Vaccination does not equal immunity!!-!-!!
1/1	vaccines protect not only against disease but also against infection and transmission
1/1	vaccines rock!!
1/0	vaccines should be a no brainer. this is ridiculous
0/0	vaccines sterlized me
1/1	vaccines were never made to make you immune. They make you resistant, vaccines work by literally giving you a weaker dose of COVID so your body can build up a resistance to the virus, you can still contract and die from COVID but the chances of doing so are much smaller
1	vaccines were never made to prevent viruses. They keep you alive and out of the hospital. Sorry for your sisters passing. The statistics show she had a higher chance of dying from lightning than from a vaccine. It likely wasn‚Äôt the vaccine itself.
1/1	vaccines work
1/1	vaccines work for the general population and there are always going to be extremes where it will not work on very few people.
1/1	vaccines work. Read a biology book perhaps you need some help with the basics.
0/0	vaccins do not work for virusses that mutate.The medical professionals (whats in a name nowadays?) have to inform you by obligation all possible side effects, including death
0/0	vax have killed countless numbers of infants and old folk., vax to not work at all. you can not prove vax are safe and work.
1/1	vaxxed + got covid before my booster, felt like shit but knew i didn‚Äôt need to go to the hospital either so others who need it more, can.
1/1	vaxxed and voted üíÖüèæ
1/-1	very reassuring thanks for the 7 day vid!
0/0	very very very veru rare veeeeeeeeeery rare to get ''covid 19'' under the age of 70.
1/1	viral load is less in vaxed then unvaxed
0/0	virus is man made, the pandemic was planned, the vaccine trials started before the pandemic:
0/0	viruses have always been with us, and our immune system should fight it without any of those rna nano super safe vaccine
0/0	wait til your immune system totally crumbles.... next man made virus.
1/1	wait till the antivaxxer realized their phone have microchips
1/1	wait until there's another polio outbreak in US, then those anti-vaxxers might shut up
0/0	wake up do your own research don't rely on a bunch of corrupt 'experts' that have their heads buried in an Aldi bag. As Craig kelly demonstrated covid 19 can be treated with ivermectin, there is a 99% recovery rate. the real issue here is Gates invested millions into vaccines and is determined to push it at all costs.
1/1	walk-in #COVIDVaccine clinics. We're operating walk-in clinics for dose 1 and 2 for people aged 12 and older, and booster vaccine clinics for people aged 16 and older.
1/1	want covid-19 vaccines to come soon here. The bad situation will end soon,.
1/-1	want to travel

1/1	watin for the vaccine, definately getting it
1/1	we ain`t gonna beat this virus without this vaccine
1/1	we all need the vaccine to stay healthy!!!
1/1	we all need to vaccinate asap..itsnot another option that we have.we don‚Äôt have other option..!!
1/1	we are all in this together (and together is the only way we can defeat the virus with the vaccine).
1/1	we are changing approach due to 1 in 100,000 blood clot? 1 in 100,000 thats not even an indication that the blood clot is caused by the vaccine
1/1	we are doing the vaccination to protect the people and ourselfes
1/1	we are going to be okay- vaccine
1/1	we are going to do the vaccines to protect ourselves and the people around us
0/0	we are test RATS!
0/0	we arent anti vaxxers. I know I'm not anyway. I had all of my shots as a kid and when I joined the military. My 3 year old son also has his vaccines and boosters. I dont believe in anti vaxxing, however I refuse to put something in my body that took less than a year to make that's not proven to fight a virus. There was no mass studies and trials with it. If you call that anti vaxxing then I dont know what to tell you.
1/1	we barely know the long term risks of COVID-19 too. I'd sooner have just the RNA of the spike protein injected in to my tissue than have the whole bat virus taking over me.
1/1	we can finally not be so afraid of the vaccine and collectively have a positive attitude towards getting it and beating this pandemic
1	we can win against Corona virus if vaccinated
0/0	we cant vaccinate our way outta this.
0/1	we don't know what sort of side effects may come out later, but quit being scared and take the shot, we think it's safe
0/0	we don't need your vaccination!And stop planting fear in our hearts!Covid 19 isn't that much threatening as malaria etc
0/0	we dont need vaccines. we know treating covid early on will save 99.9% of all people
0/0	we dont want this unnessary vaccine....it is not a conspiracy.
0/-1	we don‚Äôt believe COVID-19 is a threat.
0/0	we don‚Äôt need the vaccine because we were previously infected with Covid-19 and have natural immunity to protect them
0/0	we don‚Äôt trust COVID-19 vaccines in general.
0/0	we don‚Äôt want to inject our kids with this vaccine!!!!
1/1	we get flu shots every year, quit fearmongering
1/1/-1	we got lucky with their vaccine decisions, as they seem to have messed up a heck of a lot of others in this pandemic.
1/1	we got our second shot yesterday-- feeling crappy today but man it's so much better than the alternative.
1/0	we have peer reviewed studies that show that those with natural immunity who already risked their lives with the virus are 2 1/2 times more likely to get reinfected than those with the vaccine.
0/0	we have to learn to live with Covid. Mask or not, vaxed or not! End the mandates!
0/0	we just believe their word do we...absolutely NOT. Jog on!!
1/1	we know that on a population level, vaccines decrease vulnerability to severe disease
0/0	we know that the medical proffession is a business. Sell fast, deal with the negative effects in the courts years from now!
1/1	we love a vaccinated king
1/1	we need as many vaccines in development as possible
1/1	we need more people to be vaccinated
0/-1	we need more vaccines so everybody can not take them
1/1/1	we need the immunocompromised to get vaccinated ASAP
1/1	we need the vaccine, to prevent ourselves from the virus because unlike the influenza, this one is more fatal
1/1	we need those vaccines now
1	we need to be careful especially unvaccinated people as they more risk to new variant pose more lethal and contagious.
1/0	we need to know with any drugs it has side effects
0/0	we put so many things in our body that we have no idea what the ingredients are, or if they‚Äôre good or bad. I‚Äôd rather be safe then sorry
1/1	we relied heavily on previous vaccine research to develop it, including research on other coronaviruses like SARS and MERS making it completely reliable!
1/1	we tried to mitigate to keep activities open, as we can't afford to close them anymore, and hoping in vaccines. Covid Zero just can't be applied here (In my opinion)
0/0	we understand VERY CLEARLY just how poisonous these vaccines are.
0/0	we waiting to see if the COVID-19 vaccine safe.
1/1	we were all blessed to be able to have access to those vaccines which prolonged lives or enhanced them!
1/-1	we were thinking of booking later and wanted
1/1	we will get vaccinated as soon as we can to be able to travel and visit my family without infecting them.
1/1	we will get vaccinated as soon as we can to be able to travel and visit them without infecting them
0/-1	we worried about COVID-19 vaccine side effects.
1/1	we're already aware of the effects of the coronavirus so the concern of being made to Quick really means nothing if you're comfortable with vaccines that have been around for decades.
1/1	wear appropriate clothing so that we can get to the injection site
1/1	well done, I have now had both of my jabs, I feel safer now, and I am hoping if more and more get their jabs the world can move on and perhaps covid can die out.
0	well hopefully soon...they dont know...they will never know
1/1	well if you get COVID that also has a high mortality rate. Heart disease is still the #1 killer in America. You have a much higher chance of having sudden cardiac arrest in your sleep than dying of the COVID vaccine, which hasn‚Äôt been linked to any deaths by the way. People die after getting the flu shot too because of underlying conditions. It just happens.
1/1	well im ganna go get vaccinated and prevent myself from unknowingly killing someone cause i gave them bat soup germs.
0/-1	well im not gonna wear a mask it makes my face hot
0/0	well it looks like vaccines do harm people after all
1/0	well let me start off by saying i‚Äôm pro vaccine, but i think all the conflicting information that comes out about them has me a little wary ? so in short yes i would get it but i wouldn‚Äôt be the first in line to get it if that makes sense.
0/0	well said I'm sick of getting pressured into having it I'm not having it my friend dad had it and he died with in 2 months of having it I had other family friends have it and ended up seriously ill from it
0	well then i guess theyll never get normalcy, because i dont need the shot and will never get the shot
0/-1	we‚Äôve seen this before with a different vaccine right? So we have two vaccines that are set to start with phase 3 trials? This is huge that we have multiple vaccines doing well, but it still isn‚Äôt the final step. Correct me if i‚Äôm wrong.
1/-1	what I meant is the non jabbed will get the virus, suffer from it and then rise the people in the intensive care units and whatever steps the country take, we the jabbed ones will suffer. Why not just get jabbed. What‚Äôs the big deal ?????
1/1	what a coincidence that i took the vaccine and never got covid! how could this have happened!
1/1	what a shame. this will slow down vaccinations and cause even more hesitation. chance of clotting with the vaccine is 0.0000068% while actually catching covid is 16.5%. horrible decision
0/-1	what about mutations, particularly the Delta and Omicron variants? What if a mutation overpowers a vaccine? Does this mean we have to take another one or a booster ? Would it be safe ?
1/1	what about the literal millions that have died from covid itself. It‚Äôs a huge country of course things can go wrong especially with medical stuff. But for the most part this thing is stomping out covid.
1/1	what are the side effects? I had none. From my perspective, all you people talking about all the serious side effects are the ones talking crazy, because I didn't have any.
1/1	what are you even on about? You‚Äôre literally ruining your own life because you believe the vaccine is harmful. I think you need to ditch the conspiracy theories and scare stories on the internet which do no favours for you, and speak to a health professional who can then reassure you that this is not poison, it‚Äôs not a government controlled big reset. Don‚Äôt listen to the people who post scare stories, they don‚Äôt care what you do, the health professionals do care about you.
0/0	what caring parents give their children a vaccine with unknown side effects. This is no were near the same scenario as polio or small pox.
0/-1	what do pro-vaxxers and anti-vaxxer have in common? Neither will ever be "fully- vaxxed"
1/-1	what happens when an anti-vaxxer says "Show me the research.." And you do.
0/0	what he will probably say and what the vaccine supporters will eat up is that the vaccine isn't supposed to prevent infection or stop spread. it's real purpose is to allow you to get covid but not get so sick you go to the hospital. They'll cheer at how well it worked for him.
1/1	what i have heard is that moderna is slightly worse than the other vaccine, but still im foing to get it when i can.
1/1	what is mmy fault if others dont do the vaccine.. I want all them to do it, to get back to normal life..!! FINALLYYYYYY
0/0/0	what is the sideload in the vaccine that they really want to inject into us besides the corona virus?
0/0	what is wrong with her head? she got the vaccine?
0/-1	what the chances that the vaccine is made to kill off certain people at a certain time ??
1/1	whats the difference between anti-vaxxers and special need children? Special need children actually grow up
1/1	whats up with the anti-vax saying let them take it first? you realise these company have done tested to 1000 or more people right?
1/1	when 90% of the Covid hospitalizations are unvaccinated, thats dead solid proof the vaccines are in fact saving people. Theres the odd case who was vaxxed, however 90% is overwhelming proof
1/1	when can I get the vaccine in 59
1/1	when enough people are vaccinated herd immunity will happen, it is really our only hope to end this
0/0	when he says that it only works if everybody gets it, he is literally admitting it doesn't work.
0/0	when he says that the vaccination only works if everybody gets it, he is literally admitting it doesn't work.
1/1	when i got the covid vaccine, yeah, i was terrified, im absolutely terrified of getting vaccinated, not because its a bad thing, but because i have an irrational fear of needles, but still, id rather get vaccinated ten times in a row than to be sick with a deadly virus, id literally rather have to be vaccinated every day for the rest of my life if it meant id be completely healthy and have inmunity to deadly illnesses
1/1	when i researched the different vaccines, i think the fizer is the best for sensitive body type... Just go with it...
1/-1	when i was 5, i tripped and fell. I do not walk now to prevent myself from tripping, join me and levitate everywhere. Make sure your kids levitate too or they might trip
1/1	when i was a baby i was vaccinated with mmr. that night i had a very very high fever and was taken to hospital. and it gave me permanent brain damage and ALMOST died. the doctors didnt know what caused it. and even that didnt give me autism. but i still believe vaccines work and are good for you.
1/1	when l got vaccƒ±nated l had neƒ±ther soreness nor redness around the ƒ±njectƒ±on site l mean that l had no sƒ±de effects cem
1/1	when one becomes so blind with political partisanism that they end up calling vaccine mandates and covid 19 restrictions fascist. Science and politics used to be different.
0/0	when scientst speedrun vaccines
0/1	when someone survives it, that person becomes immune and will not be capable of passing it onto people.
1/-1	when stupidity is more contagious than covid, and there's no vaccine.
1/1	where does it say that in the constitution? employers can do what they want. nurses have always required vaccinations. if you dont want it, get a new job somewhere else. work from home.

1/1	why are people still having problems getting the covid vaccines? get your god damn shots if i gotta do it you have to too
1/-1	why are there so many dislikes
0/0	why are they pushing it as a "vaccine" when it clearly isn't? This one is gene therapy, not a vaccine as such. The public wouldn't take it up if it was marketed as what it actually is. It's false representation & very misleading, so obviously there's another agenda here.
0/0	why are u putting another persons life at risk by trying to force them to get a vaccine, u are absolutely clueless, I suggest u look at vaers and all of the 1000 people that have died after having the vaccine and the other 1000‚Äôs that have suffered adverse reactionsü§°
0/0	why are you trying to force something on me I don't want?
0/0	why aren‚Äôt you saying how many people died right after getting the vaccine ? since you know it causes soreness ? i‚Äôm sure you heard how norway is advising no one to take this nano particle vaccine
0/0	why bother pointing out facts and statistics that contradict the "experts" and the "approved" narrative when they will just be removed for a "violation" of social media policy.
0/0	why didn't you bring up that vaccines have to have a way longer testing trail periods and a far grander pool of participants to determine if they are save, than we had even until now? Or that governments gave exemptions to pharmaceutical companies to shield them from liability?
1/1	why do people not understand the concept of if you're vaccinated you have, at least, less chances of being infected and/or hospitalized
0/0	why do vaccine manufacturers lobby for legal immunity from prosecution for damages if their products are so "evidently" safe?'
0/0	why does someone who was vaccinated still gets covid-19? That simply means the vaccines don't work against covid-19
0/1	why everybody turn blind eye that this count as biological weapon ?
0	why get a vaccine that doesn't even fully protect you OR might not even last forever from a 99.9 percent death rate virus. : |
0/0	why in the world would we trust them injecting ANYTHING into our veins??
1/1	why is everyone so scared to take it?
1/1	why is it people that, people still don't trust vacinating?
0/-1	why my healthy 19 year old niece got a heart attack after the Pfizer vaccine? Why is it people like my niece never get to tell their story? She is lucky to be alive but her life is forever changed.
0/0	why not just strengthen your immune system so your body can do its job and not need a vaccine? A healthy body doesn't need a vaccine. Take care of yourself and you'll be okay.
1/1	why not take the vaccine and be done with it?
1/1	why people can't just appricate science, if they don‚Äôt want take it then don‚Äôt why need to be so negative
0/0	why take vaccine with 95% protection, when recovery rate is about 98% from the disease?
0/0	why take vaccines when you can have Jesus
1/1	why wasn't it already at top production
0/0/1/0	why we need to take vaccine if the virus has 99.9% survival rate ??
0/0	why would a nation inject it's entire military forces with this experimental technology? don't airline pilots have to eat different meals to avoid food poisoning?
0/0	why would anyone get vaccinated with a survival rate over 95%? let's not forget how the china flu was used to rig an election.
1/1	why would anyone go to the trouble and expense of putting chips (for purposes other than stated) in millions upon millions of vaccines when all your information is already being tracked by your cellphone?
0/0	why would the Creator of the world design his world where we need vaccines just to live his life?
0/0	why would we take something if "we don't know the effects"
0/0	why would you get vaccinated if you already had it
0/0	why would you mandate a vaccine that doesn't work? if I take a vaccine against measles I'm protected against measles but if I take a vaccine against covid I'm not protected against covid... so why mandate that stuff?
0/-1	why would you put your life in to this risk huh
1/1	why yes I support a healthy physique and scientific research on vaccines, how did you know?
1/1	why??????what's wrong with vaccines?????
1/1	will be getting mine soon, need to protect not only myself but my children and grandchildren. Side affects seem small compared to risk of death.
1/1	will definitely be taking that vaccine!
1/1	will help to break the chain of transmission of COVID-19
0/-1	will people actually ever get vaccinated?
1	with the reports around what even asymptomatic COVID could do to a healthy set of lungs in the long term vaccination is far preferable to mild to moderate
1/1	with the vaccine here, I hope things will get better.
0/1	woah this is all so cool! It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s important to be safe and reaserch the vaccines before you get them of course, but this video seems really interesting! I see your getting a lot of comments trashing the science and depending on conspiracy, so i just want to say thank you for the time and effort for making this! i enjoyed it :)
0/0	won't be getting it, thanks.
1/0	work for a major healthcare provider and even then they‚Äôll only provide UPTO for going to get it. Some of my coworkers are even holding off getting the vaccine for that very reason.
0/0	worried about the side effects of the vaccine
0/-1/-1	worried about the side effects of the vaccine because I am 54
0/0	would rather die of covid then be injected by retard juice
0/0	would seriously want to stay away from this vaccine for a few years because this technology of developing vaccine is never been used before.
0/0	would you acept a drug or vaccine where the drug company has no liabiliy as to any harm caused by the vaccine. would you accept a vaccine which is still undergoing trials. im not an anti vaxer, the answer for me is no, and im shore there are millions of others who feel the same, unfortunatley they are trying to take our voice away.
1/1	would you rather your grandma die than take vaccine??
0/0	wouldn't take it if my life depended on it. Because it doesn't.
0/1	wow they've got rollercoasters there. Thats a really smart way of attracting people to get vaccinated. A shot and a ride

0/-1	wow wasted my time... never watching ABC again.
0/1	wow! i cant believe they are refusing medical treatment if you don't get a covid vaccine! That is insane they are doing that. How is that legal i can't wrap my head around that being legal.
1/-1	wow, then what happened to 2,941,533 random citizens
1/1	wow.. science is wonderful.. imagine how many disciplines it takes to build all those stuff... I feel like a dot of dust, or probably a mere electron now :D
0/1	y father is a Doctor Epidimologist and he has been threatened not to speak, since this vaccine comes way too early and it needs at least 2 to 3 years future testing. Second of all my father said COVID-19 is getting mutation with time, which means it's changing and this vaccine is for the previous covid structure and not for the new one. Plus that we do not know the exact side effects of this vaccine.....
1/1	y'all also realize people experience different things??so if one person reacts negatively that doesn't mean YOU will.
1/1	y'all eating McDonald's and ramen noodles on a daily while drinking cola and think a vaccine is unsafe
1/0	y'all ever flex on non-vaxxed kids by being alive

1/1	yall cry about quarantine but then don't wanna trust the cure just take it
1/1/1/1/1/1	yay Vaccine

0/0	yea ill, get some nature, sun, eat healthy and exercise. No vaccines for me, they not putting nothing in me.
0/0	yeah and? Of course I'm admitting it. Whats gonna happen to me? They gonna beg me real nice to get the jab. Pfft I still say no. As it said, nothing they do or say will change my mind.

1/1	yeah i don't care let the unvaxxed die let the people who don't want to wear mask get sick.
0/0	yeah idc how "safe" the vaccine is, im not taking it
1/1	yeah if I was in that situation where I'd need to be vaccinated to visit a dying relative or somehting no matter how antivaxx someone is I feel like they'd get vaccinated
0/0	yeah im not taking it even if there is a mandate. and i will fight. i see whats happening in some places tho, and it just makes me more glad im in Texas.
0/0	yeah im not taking that bud
0	yeah so they mean we all are LAB RAT, bcus its new type of vaccine and they dont know the side effects... yet
1/0	yeah that's how vaccines work. I was 7 years old when I turned into a cyborg by a flu shot and now I suffer from constant existential crysis
0/0	yeah the passport is apparently a way to control us and take away our civil rights for not been obedient and taking the poison.
1/1	yeah! The vaccine is safe! It's safe! No problems at all!
1/-1	yeah!!!!!!!!!
1/1	yeah, cool, ship me some Sputnik please.
0/0	yep and they also took years to discover the side effects. I'd rather take my chances on not getting it.
0/1	yep then we end up like i am legend
1/-1	yes
0/1	yes actually 60 days is enough... any and all side effects happen within 1 to 3 days... it's a dose of salts and a protien... it's not asbestos or round up... but do remain in fear, and ignore the actual threat...
0/0	yes and did you know the Red Cross will not accept plasma donations from anyone vaccinated because they do NOT have any antibodies.... doesn't that defeat the purpose of the vaccine entirely????
0/0	yes hard to believe because the flu shot made me really sick for 6 weeks why i never do it again this be no different
1/1	yes i do, because vaccinating is a good thing in almost every way and i don't tend to believe conspiracies either
1/1	yes if it means we can get back to life again, I'm all for it.
0/0	yes they mutate when the population is immune so we were immune , so why did we need this vaccine.
1/1	yes they should be fired if they don't want vaccination
1/1	yes to vaccines, stop being stupid
0/0	yes vaccines like the antivirus update of BGates. We commoners will take chances and leave vaccines to rich ones.
1/-1	yes! All women in medicine should be celebrated
1/1	yes, i got the vaccine. & yes, i‚Äôm getting my vaccination card laminated & putting it in my passport case.
1/1	yes, the vaccine cannot stop the virus from entering our bodies, but the great benefit comes from the previous "training" our immune system undergoes when presented with the antigen contained in the vaccine.
1/1	yes. im so excited. please lets give everyone the shot so we can finally get on with our lives
0/-1	yesterday, i was sent an invitation letter for a covid vaccination. today, i used it to line a cat litter tray!
1/-1	yet, no evidence, to prove the point you're making, stop being married to your conspiracy theories with no evidence.
1/1	yikes at least you said it's your choice but it's definitely not poison. I'll agree not enough time has passed but vaccines are a crucial part of our life expectancy today and why our children are not paralyzed for life.
0/0	you all don't know the long term effects of this vaccine and everyone is having some kind of symptom from taking it
0/0	you are NOT protecting anyone. You are only putting money into the hands of big Pharma and putting yourself in harms way‚Ä¶
1	you are alive today due to vaccination.
1/1	you are doing and distributing vaccines booster COVID-19 make for more confident and safe for people.Thank you so much.
1/1	you asked: Why take the vaccine if you're not completely protected? Because it takes time to become immune, as well as a booster shot to reach 95% effectiveness. Some people also have weaker or compromised immune system responses and can only be protected by herd immunity. We would need about 70% of the population to be vaccinated before we can accomplish that. In the meantime, we'll still need to wear masks and physically distance.
0/0	you can NOT mandate a "experimental" shot (so called vaccine)
1/1	you can prevent yourself of getting infected
1/1	you can see that the vaccines work in the icu stats where the majority of patients are either unvaccinated or partially. yes a vaccinated person can still get covid but the difference is a slight cough maybe some fatigue as opposed to intubated in icu.
0/0	you can take your vaccine and shove it up your corrupt arse. keep your needles away.
1/0	you cannot have 100% safety with any drug, I don‚Äôt understand why people expect it from this vaccine .

0/0	you do realize the guy who made the vaccine doesn‚Äôt even have it and doesn‚Äôt think it should be given out, hr literally said it needed more testing
0/0/0	you do realize, these are experimental vaccines?
0/0	you do what you consider responsible - I respect that, but do not be so arrogant to imply I am being irresponsible, because I refuse to take something that has been palmed off as a vaccine, but in the true sense of the word, it actually does not does not fulfil the definition of a vaccine.

No vaccine in human history has been tested and approved in under 5 years, yet somehow the MSM deep state puppet news and their talking heads expect us to naively believe they have not one, but several Covid-19 "vaccines" ready to go? Also, the newly proposed mRNA mutagenic ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù are not your typical vaccines of the past, they can and likely reprogram your DNA and even the scientists do not understand the full ramifications of this. The CEO of Pfizer sold 62% of his shares the very day the company declares their ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù is 90% effective - pretty sketchy timing! Pfizer Inc., itself, has a lengthy civil and criminal record of paying out billions of dollars in damages for crimes, including safety violations, bribery, corruption, and false claims. It paid out a 2.3 billion dollar fine - the largest combination civil and criminal healthcare fraud settlement in the history of the U.S. Department of Justice. Why did Big Pharma have legislation passed that protects them from being held liable for any damages their "vaccines" cause if they truly believe in them so much? Why is there a relentless and unified global push to vaccinate the global population for a PLANdemic that has a 99.8% survivability rate for people under 70?

0/0	üåàA healthy man doesn't need to be vaccinated of any covid 19 vaccine because covid 19 is not harmful for everyone and the vaccine is not a solution because covid 19 mutilated itself with time second thing, can a vaccine treat body inflammation or pneumonia? answer is no! and the third thing is. If covid 19 is so fatal it would have killed every affected patient. And next thing why the death ratio is different through out the world . it is patient body's overwhelming action on corona that makes the situation worst and because of this patient's body get inflamed and later he faces septicemia and it is a cause of death. In some cases the patient faces some heart and kidney related problems. and the thing is responsible for this, it is inflammation because inflammation damages patient's respiratory system and it is the reason for whole crisis. Because in lack of oxygen the patient's body system get destroyed and septicemia make the situation dreadful . because of it patient's body lose it's capability to kill the virus. I make you sure that The patient's body has capability to fight against covid 19 no matter what type of virus is that. but it needs time and the patient has to avoid inflammation . and it is the way the patient can avoid inflammation till the body produces antibodies against the virus. Believe or not we can stop our body inflammation by controlling our eating habits it is possible. I am a patient of pneumonia myself and I was fed up of allopathic treatment but I followed some aurvedic instructions and some research was done by myself , today I am hundred percent healthy. I don't take a single pill to treat pneumonia because I don't face it since last two years. There is no possible vaccine for corona and only Ayurveda can save from this mysterious virus. millions of experimets have been carried out no result. If someone gets affected with covid 19 he should eat only the following things. if a corona patient eats the following things his body would not produce mucus and he is safe - the things are - wheat, gram(chana) , white sugar, milk ( milk from animals) and all products made from milk , salt, red chili, mutton, chicken, fish, mustered oil, tea, masoor dal(peagion food ) ,green leaves but not Cobbage, remember all this products mustn't be contaminated and they must be pure. if the patient eat these things and don't eat enything else and follows these instructions strictly. it is nothing but common cold. it takes 15 to 18 days because the patient has already eaten something that his body would take 15 days to stop producing mucus. If someone get affected with covid 19 he must consume the said foods because this thing takes 15 to 16 days and if someone delays to apply this thing. The situation would be out of control so apply this thing immediately and the patient must wash his nose with hot water. I mean warm water and inhale hot water thrice a day by his nose and he shouldn't mix the cold water into the hot water to get the temperature down because if he does so. I don't know why but the result will be zero. so to get the temperature down either the patient can pour the water or he should wait for some time. I think Patient nose is a heaven for the virus because neither body's action nor medicine works there the patient must wash his nose. how, it is on himself because virus enter into the lungs from here and the patient get affected again and again. it is my personal experience and please have a trust on it.the patient mustn't eat the fruits neither a single bite and others vegetables besides green leaf because fruits and vegetables are the main source or cause to makes our body producing mucus. It means if the patient follows the said instructions his body never get inflammation and a healthy person doesn't need to follow this formula. It is for those who are under threat and either they have a history of pneumonia or they are in their old ages and patients of diabetes or at high risk. besides them no need to worry it is only common cold for a healthy person nothing more. I am a patient of pneumonia and I have been researching on pneumonia for last 18 years. if the patient trusts this thing. and applying this thing. he never need a vantilater and he never going to face any worst or a death. do you know why the death ratio is less in poor countries. it is the reason. the poor people don't eat fruits and vegetables as much compare to the richer and mostly the rich people have been dying with corona. a six month old child never faces pneumonia because he fed only its mother's milk. a wild animal never face pneumonia because he never eats another feed besides green leaves, a man never faces pneumonia if he eats the said things. and if you get over with it once you needn't to worry at all( if you are not a patient of pneumonia). friends pneumonia made my body too sensitive. so I discovered this thing. it took me 18 to 20 years to sort out these things. I have most sensitive body because if I eat an orange I get a body pain immediately and if I eat rice continously for four and five days I get cold that turns itself into pneumonia after one or two days I have faced corona and it took me 16 days To get rid of it and it was like a some different kind of cold for me i lost my appetite, smell and test. I became weak but I saved my life because I am on the said diet already but if I won't have known this thing I would be a dead man yet for sure with this therapy you can cure gangrene, septicemia or such wounds that not have been getting cured for long time. It takes fifteen to eighteen days to get the results starting. (A healthy person must avoid fruits and vegetables during the infection. and an under threat person must eat the said foods during the infection) Note: vitamin c daily value is different for different people. a patient of pneumonia needs very little amount of vitamin c and green leaves like spinach and lettuce can full fill this need perfectly.
